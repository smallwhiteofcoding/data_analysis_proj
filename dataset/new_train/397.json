{"text": "an international delivery service is turning to a team of runners to beat the london olympics crush . with close to five million visitors expected for the july 27 to august 12 games - along with stringent security measures and special olympic lanes reserved for athletes and employees - getting around is expected to be a challenge . so german express delivery service dhl is enlisting london-based jogpost 's team of foot couriers to help make sure packages get to their recipients on time . foot patrol : dhl has enlisted jogposts 's foot couriers to get packages around london 's streets quickly during the olympics . jogpost co-founder jj harding described his 400-odd roster of largely part-time runners as ` congestion-busters ' . he said : ` during olympic chaos and gridlock , we 'll still be able to get crucial documents to business . ' the capital 's transport infrastructure has been identified as one of the biggest risks to the games ' smooth running . dhl said in a statement announcing the deal yesterday that traffic was expected to increase along london 's core routes by 30 per cent . beating the rush : with traffic lanes reserved for olympics officials on london 's already jam-packed roads , foot couriers could be a speedy alternative for those who need packages in a hurry this summer . mr harding said that his uniformed runners , whose speed varies between 3mph and 8mph , would have an edge over the capital 's ubiquitous bicycle couriers . he said : ` we 're able to do long-distance delivery much faster with public transport . bikes ca n't go on trains . ' some routes , like london 's rotherhithe tunnel , are inaccessible to cyclists . mr harding described his joggers as mainly contract workers - anything from students to semi-professional soccer players - and suggested that they would leave feats of endurance to the olympians . ` they generally run somewhere between five or six miles a day , ' he said of his crew . ` obviously we do n't want them running half marathons every day .
