{"text": "accused : former imf chief dominique strauss-kahn , seen voting in the first round of the 2012 french presidential elections , told magistrates swinging parties were about having free and consensual sex . former imf chief dominique strauss-kahn has claimed it is ` normal ' for him to have sex with six different women at orgies . the 63-year-old economist , accused of knowingly using vice girls in an alleged prostitution ring , also told magistrates his young conquests were not call girls and that he often had sex with women in their 20s . the man once tipped as the next french president , gave the extraordinary explanation to magistrates probing claims he used # 800-a-night prostitutes at swingers ' parties . he has been charged with conspiring with pimps and of knowing fraudulently obtained money was being paid to the vice girls by the racket based in lille , northern france . in a hearing from march , the transcript of which has only been published today , a magistrate asks mr strauss-khan : ` bearing in mind the high number of girls , their age and their behaviour , do you maintain you did not know they were prostitutes ? ' ' i counted that there were six girls in total , ' mr strauss-khan replied . ` that does not seem to me to be a considerable number . ' the magistrate went on : ` do think that if they had not been paid , they would not have agreed to have sex with you on so many occasions , considering the age difference between you ? ' mr strauss-kahn answered : ` numerous young women with whom i 've had sexual exchanges - no , that 's the wrong word - sexual relations , had the same age difference . ' the world 's former top banker went on to explain : ` swinging parties are about having free and consensual sex . think what you like about it on a moral level , but no one was being paid . ' the 62-year-old has openly confessed to attending swingers parties in france and belgium , but said he never knew the girls were prostitutes because ` they were all naked at the time ' . his lawyer , henri leclerc , said : ` at these parties , people were not dressed , and i defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman . ' but mr strauss-kahn 's claims come after five french and belgian vice girls told police they were paid to have sex with the former bank chief . one girl told detectives she attended 11 orgies with him over six years and added in her statement : ' i got the feeling he liked rough sex . ' coming out of the woodwork : five french and belgian vice girls have told police they were paid to have sex with the former bank chief , seen here with his wife anne sinclair during a bail hearing in new york last year . scandal : last year mr strauss-khan was charged with raping a maid at the sofitel hotel in new york . the charges were later dropped . another prostitute named marion , 30 , also told investigators it was ` rare to find men who showed as little respect for girls ' as mr strauss-khan . she added : ` it was just pure sexual consumption , and these sessions often became bestial and violent . ' mr strauss-kahn has been embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals since he was accused of raping a hotel chambermaid in an upmarket new york hotel in may last year . after being held in new york 's notorious ryker 's island prison , criminal charges were dropped and he returned to france only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young french writer . when those allegations were also dropped , he was then confronted with more claims he used prostitutes supplied by the lille vice network . police also uncovered texts sent . between mr strauss-kahn and men accused of hiring prostitutes for him , . in which the economist referred to girls as ` equipment ' and ` bits of . stuff ' as he arranged sex sessions around the world . his lawyer richard malka has described him as a ` simple swinger ' who committed nothing more than a ` crime of lust ' . mr . malka said he and his client would now do everything in their power to . have the charges brought by two judges in lille dismissed . he . said : ` it is quite implausible and contrary to common sense to use . terms like  organised gang  and  vice network  to describe a simple . swinging activity . ` mr strauss-kahn is finding himself , in large part because of his fame , thrown to the wolves . and what a strange coincidence that all this should happen a month from a major national election . ' coincidence ? mr strauss-khan 's lawyer richard malka , said it was a ` strange coincidence ' that his client should be going through the case a month from a major national election now between nicolas sarkozy -lrb- pictured -rrb- and fran√ßois hollande . mr strauss-kahn had been widely tipped to stand as the socialist candidate in this month 's presidential election , with polls showing he would easily have beaten right-wing rival nicolas sarkozy . this week he accused britain 's guardian newspaper of fabricating an ` interview ' in which he is quoted as saying sarkozy conspired to wreck his bid for the presidency . while a furious sarkozy threatened to sue , mr strauss-kahn said the interview was simply a ` montage ' of old quotes . mr strauss-kahn is now formally under ` judicial control ' on # 85,000 bail until judges decide whether to send him to stand trial , which means he can not leave france and has to report to police regularly .", "summary": " strauss-khan charged with conspiring with pimps and knowing fraudulently obtained money used to pay vice girls .   claims he did not know women were vice girls ` because they were naked all the time '   five french and belgian vice girls tell police dsk did pay them for sex .   one said he ` liked it rough ' , another said ` sessions often became bestial and violent '   but lawyer says dsk is ` simple swinger ' who committed nothing more than ` crime of lust ' "}
