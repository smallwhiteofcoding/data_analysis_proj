{"text": "the new treatment uses a two-stage approach to stop cancers growing - and then destroy them from within . medical experts in the uk have made a major breakthrough in their research to keep breast cancer at bay for longer . a new drug , which has been tested , has been proven to stall the disease for longer than current treatments , providing fresh hope for patients . the freeman hospital in newcastle was among a handful of centres across the world to test a new treatment for advanced breast cancer . results from the study also show the drug , t-dm1 , significantly reduces the side effects of chemotherapy . while t-dm1 is undergoing further trials , the discovery is being hailed as a major step forward . dr mark verrill , consultant medical oncologist at the newcastle hospitals nhs foundation trust , has played a key role in the study , which specifically looked at an advanced form of the disease known as her2-positive . he said : ` for the first time in breast cancer , we have been able to significantly extend patients ' remission time while also reducing the side effects associated with chemotherapy . ` this is an exciting development because her2-positive breast cancer is very aggressive . once it reaches the advanced stage it becomes difficult to treat and there is a real need for effective new treatments , like t-dm1 , to improve the outlook for women with this aggressive disease . ' t-dm1 is known as an ` antibody-drug conjugate ' , which is the first medicine of its kind for breast cancer . it joins together the accuracy of the her2-targeted antibody , called herceptin , with the power of the chemotherapy agent , dm1 , as a single therapy . t-dm1 has been designed to find and destroy only the cancerous cells in a two-stage attack . firstly , it attaches to the cancer growth and blocks signals that encourage the tumour to get larger and spread . then it penetrates the cell 's outer defences and releases a high dose of chemotherapy to destroy it from within . the study 's results have been welcomed by breast cancer survivor , joanne smith , from whickham , gateshead . the 41-year-old , who was diagnosed in 2005 and had treatment over four years , said : ` anything that helps people beat breast cancer is going to be good news and is very welcome . ` it 's lovely that advances are being made and it 's especially lovely that the north east has played a part in it . ' results from the study show that more patients responded to t-dm1 and for a longer period of time , compared with the currently licensed treatment known as lapatinib plus capecitabine chemotherapy . researchers believe the technique of attaching a powerful chemotherapy to an antibody , like herceptin , could also change the way other breast cancers are treated in the future . t-dm1 is already being trialled in the earlier stages of the disease where side-effects caused by chemotherapy , like diarrhoea and hair loss , have a huge impact on patients . the drug is not yet available for use . but based on the study 's results , a licence application will be made for its approval in the uk and europe . following authorisation from the european medicines agency , t-dm1 could be made available to patients in the uk in less than a year .", "summary": " drug t-dm1 proven to stall the disease longer than current treatments , says nhs trust .   drug block growth of cancer , then destroys cancer cells from within .   could be available for sufferers within a few years .
