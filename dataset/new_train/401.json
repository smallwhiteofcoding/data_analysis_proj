' the court heard the woman had a ` limited recollection ' of what happened next , despite only having a small number of drinks while out with gray , who has been suspended from nottinghamshire police . but mr coupland said she recalled he tried to get her to touch him intimately , before raping her . jurors were told the next memory the woman had was waking up at 5.30 am to find gray still in bed with her . giving evidence , she told the court she was left feeling ` terrified ' , and like a ` prisoner in her own home ' , unable to confront gray , who was acting ` as though nothing had happened ' , because her young child was there . the woman said gray appeared to be unaware she was ` uncomfortable ' - even when she asked him several times how he had got into her home during the night . the court heard gray slept in his alleged victim 's bed , then acted ` as though nothing had happened ' she eventually plucked up the courage to call him a taxi , and as he was leaving , spotted the broken security chain . she told the jury gray said , ` do n't worry , i 'll fix it ' , causing her to lose her temper and push him out of the house . the court heard that later that day , she told a friend her version of what had happened , then called gray ` to go through the sequence of events ' . however , she said gray appeared ` cold ' , and when he asked her ` does this put you off me ? ' , she hung up . the following day , she spoke with a police officer friend , who reported the matter to her superiors . the court heard that after his arrest , gray claimed he had returned to the woman 's home and found her door ajar before forcing his way in because he ` thought something might have happened to her ' . mr coupland said gray told officers he then made his way upstairs and was invited to stay by his alleged victim , who was an ` active participant ' in sex . the court heard gray added that the pair had ` parted on good terms ' with a kiss on the doorstep , and had no idea anything was wrong until he received her phone call . jurors were told the pair had met on a night out with mutual friends around a month before the alleged attack , on july 24 last year . they swapped phone numbers and exchanged ` jokey ' texts before meeting for a drink . the woman said gray appeared ` articulate , funny and pleasant ' , and they met again in nottingham city centre . but she said that despite only having three glasses of wine and lemonade , and a ` strong-tasting ' vodka and coke bought for her by gray , she could not remember much of the evening . she told the jury she had a ` vague recollection ' of being unable to understand why gray got out at her house . the woman added : ' i never invite people back to my house . even if i have decided someone is okay , it is not something i do . i did not even find him attractive . ' i vaguely remember saying he needed to go , i needed to go to bed , and he needed to get a taxi from the top of the road . he went out the back door . ` my memory is of locking the door and putting the chain on . i remember being woken by the bell ringing lots and lots of times . i just ignored it and went back to sleep . ` the next thing , i was aware of a naked person . he was over me . i was in bed . it was not what i wanted .
