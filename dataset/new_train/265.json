{"text": "two western female doctors and three afghan colleagues have been kidnapped by masked gunmen in a remote area of north-east afghanistan . officials said they were snatched while travelling on horseback between yaftal and ragh districts , about 55 miles from badakhshan provincial capital faizabad . a witness said : ` i saw gunmen surround them . the people who kidnapped them had scarves over their faces . abduction : the workers were intercepted while travelling by donkey from the city of faizabad . ` they kept the two women on the horses and told the afghans to walk in front of the horses . the kidnappers took the group 's bags and carried them themselves . ' the doctors and their colleagues , believed to be a guide and two interpreters , were employed by a non-profit humanitarian organisation , the swiss-based medair , and had been working to help to treat malnourished children . abdul maroof rasikh , spokesman for badakhshan province 's governor , said it was unclear who kidnapped them . a massive search operation involving police , military and volunteers was underway , he said , but the area was rugged and ` very difficult ' to travel in . it is the same area where british surgeon karen woo , 36 , was murdered in 2010 by militants as she returned to the capital kabul . the area is not known as a focus for afghan insurgents but is home to groups of mainly criminal gunmen . police said the aid workers had been visiting a health clinic in yawan district , where the road had been destroyed by floods . ` they were travelling by donkey . two foreign women and their afghan translators were kidnapped and we have started a search operation , ' said lal mohammad ahmadzai , police spokesman for northern afghanistan . british aid worker khalil dale , 60 , was kidnapped and killed in neighbouring pakistan earlier this year . nato-led forces said they had no information on the kidnapping , while ngos operating in the area declined to comment citing the sensitivity of the issue . the kidnapping of foreigners has become relatively common in parts of afghanistan since u.s.-backed afghan forces toppled the former taliban government in 2001 , sparking a decade-long anti-insurgent war . concerns for the hostages ' safety are likely to be high after another western aid worker , captured in neighbouring pakistan , was executed last month . khalil dale , 60 , was taken at gunpoint while working with the british red cross in january . he was found beheaded and riddled with bullets on april 28 , in an orchard in the south-west city of quetta . the pakistani taliban claimed responsibility and along with the body was a note addressed to the chief of police , which read : ` this is the body of khalil who we have slaughtered for not paying a ransom amount . ' and in october 2010 , british aid , worker linda norgrove died in a botched rescue attempt after she was taken hostage in kunar province . it was originally reported that the 36-year-old , from the western isles , had died at the hands of her captors but an investigation later revealed she was in fact killed by a grenade thrown by the u.s.-led team of would-be rescuers . earlier this month a video was posted on jihadist websites in which american captive warren weinstein is seen urging barack obama to meet al qaeda 's demands and set him free . mr weinstein , 70 , was working for a development consultancy in pakistan , where was taken from his house in the city of lahore last august .", "summary": " women snatched while travelling on horseback .   employed by not-for-profit swiss organisation .   massive search underway .   area is home to groups of criminal gunmen .
