' ` it was the most embarrassing day of my life ' : becky will never forget the moment she became stuck in a theme park ride . healthy : supermarket worker becky once used her discount card to buy pork pies and sweets - now she eats low fat foods and grills instead of fries . becky , who is a full-time mother , ballooned to a dress size 32 and a whopping 33 stone after years of gorging on junk food . she said : ` it started when i was in my late teens and i moved out of home into my own flat . i stopped eating proper meals . ' i got a job in safeway and used my discount card to buy crisps , chocolates and cream cakes every day . i would stuff myself . ' i was working shifts and on my way home from work , i 'd stop off at the chip shop . ' on an average day , becky would eat three bags of crisps , two chocolate bars , sandwiches , a pizza , sausage rolls , pork pies and cornish pasties . her weight spiralled out of control after she met husband gary , 34 , a factory worker , and gave birth to their daughter lilly , now six . becky said : ` when lilly was a toddler , i started dieting . i tried different things - weight watchers , slimfast - but nothing worked for me . ' i was always hungry and would fill up on anything i could grab . i was probably eating the same amount . ' i just got it into my head that i would never lose weight . i just thought ` that 's me ' and hid myself in baggy clothes . ' i did n't own a full length mirror . i did n't want to see myself . ' it was n't until the day out at drayton manor theme park in staffordshire that becky got the wake-up call she needed . she said : ` lilly was only three at the time and she wanted to go on every ride . i always avoided them . ' i used to come up with excuses but she begged me to go on the cars with her . i did n't like seeing her upset so i gave in . super mum : thirty-three stone becky edwards was humiliated into losing more than half her body weight after getting stuck on a roller coaster at drayton manor theme park . ` as we went round , the wheel was cutting into my stomach . it was very uncomfortable . ` when the ride finished , i tried to stand up but i realised i was stuck . ` lilly sat there waiting for me to get off . she shouted : ` come on mum , hurry up . ' she wanted to go on the other rides . she was young and did n't understand what was happening . ` it was so embarrassing . my biggest fear was that they would have to call the fire brigade to cut me out . ' after several minutes , becky finally managed to free herself . she said : ` it felt like i was stuck forever . ' i grabbed lilly 's hand and walked towards gary . there was a crowd of people looking at me . ' i was hot and my face was bright red . ` gary had seen everything but he knew it was best not to mention anything . we never talked about my weight . i think he was worried about upsetting me . ` after that , i refused to go on any more rides . ' liberating : now becky says she can go on any children 's rides she likes . on the journey home , becky tried to make a joke out of her misfortune . she said : ' i laughed it off . i said it was a kid 's ride and adults should n't go on it but i was struggling to hold back the tears . ` as soon we got home though , i locked myself in the bathroom and cried . it really upset me . ' i hated my body and was ashamed at how fat i 'd let myself get . ' she also realised that her bad relationship with food could have fatal health implications . ' i was always breathless and at risk of having a heart attack . ` i 'd cook a healthy meal for lilly and gary but i would n't eat it myself . i was setting a bad example . ' i decided i needed to do something if i wanted to see her grow up . i did n't want to leave her without a mum . ' becky joined her local slimming world group and within a month she had lost a stone and a half.she said : ` you can eat what you want but you change how you cook things . i do n't use oil and i grill everything . ` anne my slimming world leader has been brilliant . when i 'm struggling she will always helps me . the group is like one big family . we all look after each other . ` when i fell pregnant with my son harry , i had a break from slimming world and put on two stone but as soon as he was born , i was back again . ' in total , dropped nine dress sizes and has slimmed down to a healthier 14 stone . she hopes to lose a further two stone to reach her target . becky says she still has flashbacks to that day but it has n't stopped her going to the theme park . she said : ` we went to drayton manor a couple of weeks ago and i went on everything . ` lilly said to me the other day : ` you used to be fat , mummy , but now you 're not . ' ` it made me feel so proud .
