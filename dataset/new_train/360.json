{"text": "mirren : what ... you want me to play the queen again ? helen mirren portrayed queen elizabeth ii for the second time on tuesday -- at a reading of a new play that features her maj and some of the 12 prime ministers she 's seen during her reign . but there were questions as to whether or not tony blair would make the cut . ` it was rather poignant , seeing helen as her majesty again , ' a friend who was at tuesday 's private performance tells me . the monarch will be the only royal in the drama , called the audience . ` it 's about the personal , with the background of the political , ' a confidential source tells me . mirren , who won a best actress oscar for her stunning portrait of elizabeth ii in the queen , did a reading of peter morgan 's script -- which is described as still a work in progress -- along with several actors , playing the six or seven pms who will feature in the play . morgan , who also wrote the screenplay for stephen frears 's 2006 film , has included winston churchill , who was there for the weekly audiences at the beginning of her reign ; harold wilson ; margaret thatcher ; james callaghan and john major . gordon brown and david cameron are possibilities , too , although no one would go on the record about tony blair . ` it focuses on the relationship one person has had , supposedly in private , with a succession of prime ministers , ' another insider involved in the production tells me . ` in the current draft there are six , could be seven , of her pms , but work continues on the play 's text . ` it 's far from finished and peter . likes to keep writing till the last minute . the one constant is the . queen . the others are her prime ministers , and they 're moveable . ' reunited : helen mirren is teaming up again with peter morgan , who wrote the screenplay for the oscar-winning 2006 film the queen . i understand that those who attended tuesday 's reading in london found the play ` very touching , very funny and quite confessional ' . ` peter has done a lot of background research and spoken to lots of people , in the way he did for the queen and his tv films about brown and blair . ` there 's stuff in it that people will know about , and some they wo n't , ' my source says , although they were quick to add that ` it 's a play , not a documentary ' . ` it 's not taken from what people have actually said ; rather peter has created a work about what they might have said . ' stephen daldry , who is in negotiations to direct the audience , was at the reading , too , along with producers and associates from the companies run by matthew byam shaw , robert fox and andy harries -lrb- who was one of the producers of the queen -rrb- . celebrated designer bob crowley is believed to be in negotiations to create the costumes and sets for the audience which , if all the various deals can be done , will be in the west end next year . shakespeare in love : at a delicate stage . where art thou -lrb- to misquote the bard -rrb- stage version of oscar-winning film shakespeare in love ? to borrow another of will 's favourite phrases , thereby hangs a tale . once upon a time there was talk that a theatre production of the movie -- which won seven academy awards including ones for stars gwyneth paltrow and judi dench , writers tom stoppard and marc . norman and best film -- was going to have a run in the west end . initially , stoppard was going to re-write it for the stage , but he withdrew . so producers thomas schumacher , who heads disney 's theatrical division , and sonia friedman contracted billy elliot writer lee hall . and all was well until a recent workshop of the script involving various actors and director matthew warchus , who has won many plaudits for his work on art , boeing-boeing , god of carnage and current hit matilda -lrb- he 's working on a new show by matilda writer dennis kelly -rrb- . sharp words were exchanged and warchus has now left the shakespeare in love production , so the search is on for a new director . but the play 's the thing and i 'm sure all 's well that ends well . we can but hope the show will be ready for next year , or 2014 . image change : laura michelle kelly with co-star ronan keating in cannes . award-winning actress laura michelle kelly , who won an olivier when she originated magical nanny mary poppins on stage , is casting aside that goody-two-shoes image to play a scarlet woman . laura michelle will star as the second mrs tanqueray in a rare revival of arthur wing pinero 's 19th-century ` woman with a past ' drama at the rose theatre in kingston , surrey , for a month from september 27 . the play was about as dangerous as you could get in its day , as it told the tale of paula , a woman who , as laura michelle puts it , ` led a courtesan-type life and then swapped that to become the wife of a very rich man ' . ` it 's almost the reverse of my fair lady , in that when she enters the high life , she has n't learnt not to say outlandish things and she innocently insults people , ' says laura michelle , who also played eliza doolittle in trevor nunn 's production of my fair lady in the west end . the play is also about victorian-era hypocrisy , she adds , in that paula pays a price when a man from her past threatens to wreck her new life with her husband and step-daughter . for laura michelle it marks a return to the uk stage after two years -lrb- on and off -rrb- playing mary poppins in the disney - cameron mackintosh show on broadway . she took a break to appear opposite ronan keating in the film goddess , which was shot in australia . she and keating attended a special screening of the picture during the cannes film festival last month . laura michelle will leave her apartment in the trendy williamsburg district of brooklyn for rehearsals with the second mrs tanqueray director stephen unwin in late august . in between , she 'll continue working with sting at workshops for the rock star 's musical the last ship , which is set in newcastle . and she 'll play anna in the king and i for six performances at the muny theatre in st louis , missouri , in early august . the london 2012 festival is jam-packed with amazing arts , but do see three short films commissioned by bbc films and film 4 : the odyssey , by asif kapadia ; mike leigh 's a running jump ; and lynne ramsay 's swimmer . also , rupert goold 's splendid film of richard ii , with an excellent ben whishaw . shot entirely on location , it 's the first part of the hollow crown -lrb- henry iv , pars 1 & 2 , and henry v to follow -rrb- made by the bbc , neal street productions and nbc international .", "summary": " helen mirren dons regal attire for reading of new play on the west end .   the audience was written by peter morgan , the man behind 2006 film the queen , which won the actress her oscar .
