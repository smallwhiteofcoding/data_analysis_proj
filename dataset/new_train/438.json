{"text": "dr sharad shripadrao pandit told an inquest he denies telling alina sarag 's family her illness was ` all in her head . ' a 15-year-old schoolgirl died of tuberculosis after a series of doctor errors missed the chance to detect and cure her disease , with her gp claiming she was ` lovesick ' , an inquest heard today . alina sarag died in january last year after a gp allegedly advised her that her physical deterioration was due to mental health problems . the teenager 's father , sultan sarag , told birmingham coroner 's court his daughter was told she needed to see a psychiatrist or even a spiritual healer . alina 's parents called her gp more than 50 times about their daughter 's ailing condition over a four-and-a-half month period before her death . she was also seen by more than five doctors at four different hospitals but medics failed to detect the curable disease . her distraught father , broke down as he told the court : ` the doctor said to her ` did you meet someone on holiday ? are you missing him ? ` she found it very distressing he was suggesting she was lovesick for a boy . ` he said all the problems were in her head and she should see a psychiatrist or spiritual healer . ' mr sarag also claimed dr sharad shripadrao pandit accused him of ` mollycoddling ' alina , and refused to test his daughter for tb . he told the inquest : ` he said :  we do n't need these tests , we are not going to get them done either .  ' alina was told by her gp that she may have bulimia and would need to see a psychiatrist , the inquest heard . giving his version of the disputed conversation concerning his recommendation that alina should see a psychologist , dr pandit said it had not taken place in the teenager 's presence . ' i did not do that in front of alina at all . she was terribly young , she was 15 , ' he said . ` she went to the car with her father and i asked her mother to wait . ' i wanted information from the parents , particularly the mother . ' today on the fourth day of the inquest at birmingham coroners court , dr pandit said he ` fully accepted ' tb did not ` cross my mind ' despite knowing she had previously been struck down with the disease in 2009 . but he denied telling her family her illness was ` all in her head . ' dr pandit said : ` there was never any discussion about tb or sign of tb . it did not match her symptoms . i fully accept tb did not cross my mind . ' ` every time she -lsb- alina -rsb- came to see me she walked into the surgery unaided and she never looked unwell . i would not have recorded her condition as ` normal ' if she had not seemed so . father : sultan sarag outside birmingham coroner 's court today . mr sarag told the court her daughter 's gp had told her she was ` lovesick ' tragic : 15-year-old anita , pictured before she died from tuberculosis last year . loss : alina pictured at 14 . a string of doctors at four different hospitals failed to spot her tuberculosis . ` she never presented to me with a cough or night sweats . i would not have behaved in a threatening way to her father as her family have suggested . i would not have told them it was all in her head . ' ' i would not have recorded her condition as ` normal ' if she had not seemed so . she never presented to me with a cough or night sweats . ' i would not have behaved in a threatening way to her father as her family have suggested . ' i would not have told them it was all in her head . ' at the conclusion of his evidence , dr pandit said that , as a gp , he still did not know what else could have been done to save alina 's life . the long-serving doctor , who heads the highgate practice , also attempted to offer his condolences to alina 's family , prompting them to walk out of the courtroom . another gp at the highgate surgery , dr khalid iqbal , told the coroner he believed alina did not have active tb when he assessed her on four dates in september and october 2010 . dr iqbal eventually referred alina to birmingham children 's hospital but did not pass on details of her previous history of latent tb in his referral letter . ' i do n't think she had active tb at the time , ' the doctor said . ` none of the symptoms were suggesting that she had tb . ' memories : sulton sarag and farhat mahmooda , alina 's parents , hold a scrapbook with pictures of alina , pictured right at seven years old . mr sarag - who is also being treated for tb - told the inquest his daughter vomited up to 10 times a day and had to be carried to bed ` like an old woman with weak legs ' . ' i would spend hours rubbing her back , arms , head and neck to try and help ease her pain , ' he said . he added that he made more than 50 phone calls to the gp 's surgery in birmingham but dr pandit failed to return his calls . young : alina aged one at her home in birmingham . mr sarag said : ` there was mass neglect . the medical profession , as soon as they mess up they hide . ' alina first contracted tb in 2009 after a girl at her school was diagnosed with the illness . she was prescribed a course of antibiotics at birmingham chest clinic but medical staff never followed up her treatment . alina was struck down again in july 2010 after returning from a trip to pakistan with her family . the inquest heard a simple phlegm test would have shown alina was suffering from tb but this was never carried out . instead , doctors shrugged off her family 's concerns and told them alina was suffering from a chest infection despite being classed as a ` high risk ' patient . alina 's weight plummeted and at one point she was so ill she could only tolerate baby food . after doctors at heartland and city hospitals did not detect tb , alina was admitted to sandwell hospital where she stayed for five days . tb was picked up but no phlegm test was carried out and a chest x-ray was thought to have found a chest infection . she later saw a clinical psychologist at birmingham children 's hospital but was in too much pain to complete the assessment . on january 6 , 2011 alina was rushed to hospital after suffering breathing difficulties and she died of a cardiac arrest . the hearing continues .", "summary": " she was seen by more than five doctors at four different hospitals but none detected illness .   gp admitted tb did not ` cross his mind ' despite previous history .
