{"text": "tough times : simon cowell suffered a breakdown as he collapsed under pressure , earlier this summer . simon cowell collapsed from nervous exhaustion this summer after his workaholic lifestyle got the better of him , it emerged yesterday . the star was bedridden for weeks after doctors told him to rest , according to an updated biography . it claims the 52-year-old admitted he was ` paralysed with tiredness ' and his ` immune system was failing ' because of his job . but with the x factor continuing to flop in the uk , and scheduling clashes dogging the us version , it seems there will be no respite in the near future . in an updated version of his book sweet revenge : the intimate life of simon cowell , biographer tom bower claims that the star had to halt filming of the us show as he began acting like a ` weird vampire ' , working through the night . doctors warned him to give up smoking , stop taking health supplements and give his body a break . cowell is claimed to have confided in x factor judge louis walsh : ` i desperately need peace . i 'm craving normality . i 've got to work out my demons and come out of it . ` i have to get back to where i was years ago . i have to stop reading texts at three in the morning and making calls later and later . ' he also told friends that running two high-profile shows in the uk and america had left him at breaking point . his enforced spell of rest meant he missed key promotional time with the x factor 's new us line-up , which includes britney spears . but cowell revealed he was told to take a rest because his life had ` become like a night shift ' , adding : ` i had forgotten the sensation of the morning . ' his company syco productions officially stated that he had come down with bronchitis . it is understood he took a three-week break from work to recuperate fully . the revelations come as ratings in britain for saturday night 's episode of the x factor dropped to a series low of 7.7 million , with viewers apparently put off by the decision to show fewer performances and more ` behind-the-scenes ' shots . sleeping beauty : simon was advised to get plenty of rest from his doctor after becoming a ` weird vampire ' the ratings will be a blow to cowell as they are some way below the average of more than 10million for the 2010 series . he will be hoping that the surprise reappearance of cheryl cole will provide a boost . the singer left her role as a judge for an ill-fated stint doing the same on the us version of the show , falling out with cowell after she was axed within days . but she has returned to assist gary barlow as a guest mentor for the ` judges ' houses ' stage of the singing competition , which will be screened later in the series . however , it seems that her feud with cowell is not over . after he sent her a twitter message to say ` welcome back ' , the singer said : ` i saw simon 's tweet . i 'm not doing this for him . i am doing this for gary as he 's my friend and he asked me to do it . ' meanwhile , the us version of the x factor is facing increased competition . last week cowell reacted angrily to news that a rival talent show , the us version of the voice , will be screened at the same time as the x factor returns there for a second series . he said : ` it is a spoiling tactic and it 's very simple -- -lsb- the voice broadcaster nbc does n't -rsb- want people to see this first episode ... i think it 's mean-spirited and i hope and i pray that it backfires on them because this is one of the best shows we 've ever made . ' good friend : simon confided in louis walsh throughout the dark period as the irish judge filled in for cowell on work commitments .", "summary": " x factor supremo was bedridden for weeks .   52-year-old 's ` immune system was failing ' "}
