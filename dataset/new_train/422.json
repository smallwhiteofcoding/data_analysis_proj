{"text": "michael gove yesterday warned lord justice leveson that he risks creating a ` cure ' for newspaper wrongdoing that is ` worse than the disease ' of phone hacking . the education secretary repeatedly clashed over freedom of speech with the judge running the media standards inquiry . he challenged the entire basis of the inquiry and insisted that existing law is sufficient to police the media and prevent wrongdoing . warning : . education secretary michael gove repeatedly clashed with lord justice . leveson as he urged the inquiry not to introduce new laws to police the . media . mr gove argued passionately that anything else risks undermining free speech and warned that previous public inquiries that have imposed regulations on other industries have made things worse not better . his outspoken defence of a free press seemed to rile lord justice leveson , who insisted new rules were needed to curb excesses even as he claimed he would uphold freedom of the press . mr gove , a former leader writer for the times which is owned by rupert murdoch , also refused to copy other senior politicians by distancing himself from the media tycoon . instead he described the media mogul as ` one of the most impressive and significant figures of the past 50 years ' . it emerged yesterday that he met mr murdoch and his senior aides on 11 occasions between the general election in may 2010 and july last year . but he denied that they discussed the news corporation boss 's business interests . mr gove said journalists were ` exercising a precious liberty ' when they wrote articles . he said : ` i am concerned about any prior restraint and on their exercising of freedom of speech . ' he said it was impossible to prevent newspapers causing offence to some portions of the population and that attempts to protect one group would ultimately undermine the ability of the media to hold the powerful to account . clash : mr gove 's outspoken defence of a free press appeared to rile lord justice leveson who repeatedly insisted that new rules were needed to curb excesses . but a clearly irritated lord justice leveson said : ` mr gove , i do not need to be told about the importance of freedom of speech , i really do n't . ' he said he was ` concerned ' by mr gove 's view that behaviour which is ` unacceptable ' has ` to be accepted because of the right of freedom of speech ' . but mr gove was unbowed and said that attempts to stamp out wrongdoing could make things worse . he said previous inquiries had led to regulations that were ` applied in a way to be a cure worse than the disease ' . â€¢ guardian journalist amelia hill and a scotland yard detective who was accused of leaking confidential information from the police phone hacking inquiry will not be prosecuted . the crown prosecution service said it would not be in the public interest to bring charges . . theresa may announces new measures to counter police corruption as she gives evidence to inquiry . questioned : theresa may , pictured at the leveson inquiry today , revealed new police hospitality rules have been drawn up . theresa may telephoned two news international executives to reveal she was launching a new inquiry into the disappearance of madeleine mccann . the revelations came amid mounting pressure on the government over its close ties to the murdoch empire . but mrs may denied yesterday that she had been under pressure to deliver a favour to the sun , which was campaigning for a new investigation into maddie 's disappearance in portugal in 2007 . in evidence to the leveson inquiry , the home secretary was asked about the decision to order the new scotland yard probe , which has cost the taxpayer at least # 2million . at the time , the sun and the sunday times had been serialising a book by kate mccann , madeleine 's mother . the sun was pressing strongly for a new investigation into the case . mrs may said she had telephoned -- at her own ` instigation ' -- former news international chief executive rebekah brooks , and dominic mohan , the editor of the sun , to tell them the case would be looked at again . but she denied suggestions that she had been warned that the sun would put her face on its front page every day until she agreed to the paper 's demands . mrs may announced that police would no longer be allowed to accept gifts , gratuities or hospitality apart from ` light refreshments ' under new rules to stamp out corruption . the home secretary said it was important officers did not put themselves in a position where ` people could feel that they are being influenced by the receipt of such gifts ' . mrs may revealed the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- had overhauled guidance to bring a ` clearer ' set of boundaries for meetings between the police and journalists . resigned : sir paul stephenson stepped down as met commissioner last year following revelations he enjoyed a free stay at a luxury health spa . mrs may said : ' i think it 's trying to apply common sense to the relationship the police should have with the media . ' but she reassured lord justice leveson that tighter rules would not stop beat bobbies tipping off local reporters to community news stories . he said : ` it is obviously important that , for example , neighbourhood police officers should be able to speak to local press about events in the neighbourhood - good news stories , concerns , seeking witnesses , all that sort of material . ` it seems to me sensible that everything one can do to encourage that sort of contact is worthwhile . ' the home secretary replied : ` the important thing is for officers to know where the line is drawn between who they are able to speak to and what they are able to say in those conversations . ` it should n't have a chilling effect but i think what 's important is that we have a framework that does n't have a chilling effect and a framework that enables common sense to be operated in these relationships . ' sir paul stephenson resigned as metropolitan police commissioner last year following revelations he enjoyed a free five-week stay worth # 12,000 at champneys luxury health spa , where a former news of the world executive editor arrested over phone-hacking was employed as a pr consultant . at an earlier hearing , the former head of scotland yard told the leveson inquiry that he was ` reluctant ' to accept the freebie but added that he felt under ` pressure ' to return to work after four months ' sick leave . he insisted the five-week stay was organised by the spa 's managing director stephen purdew - and he did not know they employed former news of the world journalist neil wallis , an ` acquaintance ' whom he had met socially on 11 occasions . today , the inquiry heard that mrs may was sent a briefing note preparing her for questions she might face after sir paul 's resignation on july 17 . a guardian journalist and a scotland yard detective will not be prosecuted over leaks relating to the phone-hacking scandal . there is ` insufficient evidence ' to bring charges against amelia hill , the newspaper 's special investigations correspondent , and a 51-year-old detective constable over leaks , prosecutor alison levitt qc said . the police officer has been suspended since being arrested at his desk last august . he was understood to be answering bail this morning , while ms hill has only been questioned under caution . all staff on operation weeting - the metropolitan police 's 16-month inquiry into voicemail interceptions by journalists - were required to sign confidentiality agreements before working on the case . a security review was sparked into how information about the case started appearing in the press over the summer . despite bringing no charges , ms levitt has recommended disciplinary action against the officer . police launched operation weeting , the inquiry devoted specifically to phone hacking on january 26 last year . operation elveden was launched months later after officers were given documents suggesting news international journalists made illegal payments to police officers . it included preparation for issues mps were likely to raise when she made a statement to the commons . one such question suggested it was wrong sir paul felt he could not talk to david cameron or the home secretary about the matter because it might have 'em barrassed the prime minister because of his relationship with andy coulson ' . mrs may was asked if she felt sir paul had been unable to raise the issue but replied : ' i do n't recall any such conversation . ' she told the inquiry that , by the time revelations that murdered schoolgirl milly dowler 's phone was hacked were published on july 4 , she had ` growing concerns ' about the way the press was regulated but still broadly favoured the system that was in place . on the subject of hospitality and gifts being given to the police , mrs may told the inquiry that the ` vast majority ' of officers acted with integrity . she added : ` occasions where there are questions to be raised are very limited . ' until now , police forces have drawn up their own hospitality guidelines , with wide divisions in what was deemed acceptable . acpo suggests allowing officers to receive only ` light refreshments ' during meetings with reporters , seemingly ruling out lavish lunches . the guidelines call for ` more robust decision-making ' and recommend having a single force register of gifts and hospitality governed of the head of professional standards . they will be based on ' a shift to blanket non-acceptability save for a certain circumstances and a common-sense approach to the provision of a light refreshments and trivial and inexpensive gifts of bona fide and genuine gratitude from victims and communities ' . the guidance continues : ` one extreme can properly be considered to be a breach of criminal law -lrb- the bribery act 2010 -rrb- through to the low-level hospitality which could in no way be considered as a breach of integrity on any party involved . ' mrs may said : ' i think that is a sensible approach that is being taken by acpo in an attempt to find a greater consistency . ` what 's important is n't that they have a single force register but that everybody knows that there is a general belief that they should n't be taking gifts , gratuities and hospitality , except where they are of a more trivial nature . ' mrs may later set out her reasons for not ordering a fresh investigation when new phone hacking allegations surfaced in the new york times in september 2010 - four months after she took office . she told the inquiry : ` it was n't the role of the home secretary to decide whether information in a newspaper should be investigated . ` it is the role of the police officers to decide whether information that is printed is new evidence or hints at new evidence such that they feel it is necessary to investigate that .
