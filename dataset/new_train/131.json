{"text": "when notorious mafia boss michele zagaria was seized from a secret bunker by police last december after 16 years on the run , jubilant police could be seen cheering and making the v-sign . now it appears the threat posed by the gangster who is serving a life sentence for murder has not gone away , and he is communicating with his fellow gang members through coded letters . crime author and mafia expert roberto . saviano made the claim after analysing a hand-written letter addressed to zagaria , the former head of the . camorra 's casalesi clan , which was intercepted by investigators . victory : italian police arrested michele zagaria last december after 16 years on the run . he was the most senior boss of the camorra mafia still at large . in an analysis for the italian daily la repubblica , saviano says the letter uses ` cryptic and allusive ' language and ' a real construction of coded messages ' to give information about how the restructuring of the clan , its activities with other crime groups , and its contact with corrupt politicians . he cites the sentence : ` the friends are going on holiday and they took the home-made jam and they say ` hi ' , ' and says this probably means that clan members are due in court but will keep their mouths shut . they thought it was all over : italian policemen were jubilant after zagaria 's arrest last december . now a letter to him suggests he is being kept informed of developments within the notorious casalesi clan . the line ` we 're all well and the children are growing up ' could well refer to appointments and promotions that followed the jailing of senior clan members including zagaria , says saviano . zagaria is nicknamed capastorta , or ` twisted head ' , in a reference either to his violent reputation or his asymmetrical features . ` at the market we filled the car with fruit ' could refer to arms , hand grenades being commonly known as pineapples , or to lucrative dealings in large fruit and vegetable markets , which are often run by mafia clans . saviona even asserts that a line about ` uncle nicola in his gallery ' appreciating ` everything that he 's heard ' could allude to nicola cosentino , a former junior economics minister of silvio berlusconi , who some mps want arrested over his alleged links to the camorra . control : al pacino in the 1972 film the godfather immortalised the mafia 's notoriety . mr saviano admits that despite being an authority on the naples mafia -- he has lived under armed guard since the publication of his best-selling book gomorrah : italy 's other mafia -- much of his interpretation of the letter is speculation . he said even the recipients might not understand the contents of such letters until subsequent events -- such as arrests or killings -- provide meaning or context . however what was not in doubt was that camorra members used a complex system to ensure their words could not be used against them in court , he said . the clan , notorious for its violence , is heavily involved in supplying drugs to the mafia in palermo and has alliances with albanian mobsters and nigerian crime syndicates .", "summary": " expert author says references to home-made jam and uncle nicola may have a darker meaning .
