{"text": "proctor & gamble said it will change the design of packaging for its miniature laundry detergent product to deter children from eating the brightly colored packets that look like candy . spokesman paul fox said the cincinnati-based company plans to create a new double latch lid on tubs of tide pods ` in the next couple of weeks ' . doctors said children sometimes swallow the pods thinking they are edible . nearly 250 cases have been reported to poison control centers this year . worrying : nearly 250 cases of children swallowing the detergent pods have been reported to poison control centers this year . fox initially said that to reduce the risk of poisoning , household cleaners and laundry detergents should be kept out of children 's reach . ` the packs themselves are safe , regardless of who manufactures them , provided that they are used for their intended purpose , ' he said . ` the risk becomes when they 're left like any other household product within reach of small , inquisitive hands . ' he has since announced the new packaging . although the 250 cases of kids eating the detergent are a tiny fraction of the thousands of poisoning calls received every year , doctors are still concerned . the symptoms they see in connection with ingesting the packets -- such as nausea and breathing problems -- are more severe than typical detergent poisoning . no deaths have been reported . ` we 're not quite sure why it 's happening , ' said dr. kurt kleinschmidt , a dallas toxicologist and professor at the university of texas southwestern medical center . ` but we 've clearly had some kids who have become much more ill . we look at these pods as being clearly more dangerous than the standard detergent . ' tide , purex and other detergent manufacturers introduced different versions of the packets earlier this year . the lightweight , colorfully swirled plastic packets contain a single-use amount of detergent that dissolves in water . they 're intended to be dropped into a laundry machine in place of liquid or powder detergent . error : some kids mistake the detergent pods -lrb- left -rrb- for ribbon candy -lrb- right -rrb- and eat them . several poison control centers started to get calls from parents about the packets in march and april , soon after they were introduced in earnest . texas reported 71 instances of exposure this year , all but one in march or later . missouri reported 25 cases related to the packets , and illinois reported 26 . ` if you look at the tide pods , they 're bright blue and bright red and they look very similar to some of the ribbon candy , ' said julie weber , director of the missouri poison control center in st. louis.while the detergent packets are a threat , poison control centers receive far more reports about other substances annually . in 2010 , they fielded thousands of calls about potential poisoning to children under 5 from ibuprofen , diaper rash cream and other household substances.however , doctors are alarmed about the packets because they appear to be more dangerous than just swallowing liquid or powder detergent.dr . michael buehler of the carolinas poison center said there were several possible reasons why , including that the packets carry a full cup 's worth of detergent in bite-size form or the detergent in the packet might activate more quickly or differently . caution : purex said its detergent pouch packs come with warning labels about keeping away from children . ` the children get sicker , more severe , and they do this quicker than what we 've seen with standard liquid laundry exposure , ' buehler said . in suburban philadelphia , a 17-month-old boy was home with his mother when she ` turned her back for the proverbial second , ' said dr. fred henretig of the poison control center at the children 's hospital of philadelphia . the boy climbed up on a dresser and popped a detergent package in his mouth , henretig said . the boy vomited , became drowsy and started coughing . he was eventually put on a ventilator for a day and hospitalized for a week , henretig said . poison control centers in several states have issued or are preparing warnings for local emergency rooms and parents . washington state poison control center development director terri suzuki said her center has faxed alerts to emergency rooms and posted about the capsules on its facebook page . the indiana poison control center was expected to advise parents in coming days about the packets ' risk . one child near fort wayne , indiana , tried to eat a packet and nearly had to be placed on a ventilator , said dr. brent furbee , medical director of the indiana poison control center . furbee did not know the child 's age . detergent packets are common in europe , but are a recent addition to the american market , fox said . he said tide pods had done well against other detergent packets , but it was too soon to say if shoppers appeared to be replacing liquid and powder detergent with the packs . kiem ho , vice president for marketing at purex , whose consumer goods division is based in scottsdale , ariz. , said its ultrapacks packaging comes with warning labels to keep out of reach of children . ` this is a new form of laundry product and we will continue to join other manufacturers to safeguard and educate consumers on the correct storage and use of these products in the home ' ho said in a statement .", "summary": " parents and doctors worried that kids think the pods are pieces of ribbon candy .   texas reported 71 instances of exposure this year , all but one in march or later .   missouri reported 25 cases related to the packets , and illinois reported 26 .
