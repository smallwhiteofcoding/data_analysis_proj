{"text": "the queen 's diamond jubilee celebrations could keep the uk economy in recession for three quarters of the year , bank of england boss sir mervyn king has warned . millions of people will take two days off work for a double bank holiday on june 4 and 5 as queen elizabeth ii marks 60 years on the throne . the economy survived dropping into negative territory in the same period last year after an extra holiday for the royal wedding of prince william and kate middleton hit output . celebrations to mark the queen 's diamond jubilee could keep the uk in recession , warned bank of england boss mervyn king -lrb- right -rrb- . but sir mervyn king warned yesterday that this year 's celebrations will knock 0.5 of a percentage point off economic output between april and may . the decline could hinder efforts to haul britain 's fragile economy out of recession as the crisis in the eurozone continues to dampen growth . while sir mervyn said the bigger picture was one of gradual recovery in growth , the impact of the queen 's diamond jubilee could prolong the double-dip recession . many workers are set to use the monday and tuesday bank holidays as the start of a whole week off , costing them just three days of annual leave . the remarks are a blow to david cameron , who said in his new year message that the jubilee and the olympics meant 2012 ` must be the year we go for it ' . a sign of parties to come : confetti falls and flags fly from harrods in london yesterday as the store celebrates the forthcoming jubilee . in the same period last year , the economy fell short of expectations and grew by just 0.2 per cent . the royal wedding hit output by 0.4 per cent but over the whole period the economy was able to recover . sir mervyn said growth ` zig zag ' throughout 2012 with sporting events such as the olympics providing a much-needed boost . a massive influx of overseas visitors will see them spending millions of pounds around the country . he said : ` underlying quarterly output growth -lrb- in q2 -rrb- will be around something in the order of 0.5 percent stronger than the headline measure will show . we will then see that in the q3 data we will go back to normal and will see a bounceback in growth . a bank holiday to mark the royal wedding of prince william and kate middleton last year hit economic output by 0.4 per cent . ` trying to work out exactly how the olympics will affect output growth is very difficult . our best guess is that it is likely to boost growth somewhat . our best guess , when you look at the headline numbers , underlying growth will be around half a percentage point stronger than the headline measure in q2 . ` in q3 the combination of the bounceback from the jubilee and the olympics means that you could see growth exaggerated by slightly more than half a percentage point and then you 'll get back to a weakening in q4 . ' sir mervyn told the house of lords economic affairs committee earlier this year that the jubilee celebrations would have a similar impact on the economy to last year 's royal wedding , when the recovery stalled . ` we do expect a fall in output in the second quarter followed by a rise in the third quarter , ' he said . ` we lose an extra day 's work because of the additional bank holiday . we saw that last year and we would expect that to happen again this year . ' the bank 's chief economist spencer dale said there was similar impact with last year 's royal wedding , when growth was reduced by around 0.4 percentage points . the second successive gdp quarterly has put the uk back in recession earlier this year . the gdp forecast for the next few years suggest the economy will see slow improvement , if any . he added : ` the jubilee will have a slightly bigger effect , in part because it 's happening in june rather than april , so the ability for companies to make up that output within the quarter will be that much less . ' the gloomy prediction came as sir mervyn yesterday warned the single-currency bloc was ` tearing itself apart without any obvious solution ' . official figures released earlier this year showed that the uk had fallen into a double-dip recession . the economy shrank by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of 2012 following a 0.3 per cent decline in the fourth quarter of 2011 . a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction and it was the first since the credit crunch of 2009 . alan clarke , uk and eurozone economist at scotiabank , said : ` the economy has n't grown for six months , and the headline second quarter gdp data are unlikely to stray much above zero , even if the underlying picture is more robust . ' ben broadbent , a former goldman sachs economist who sits on the bank 's interest rate setting committee with the governor , said the extra day off would disrupt business . ` it is 5 per cent of working time , ' he said . ` maybe a little less , but it is quite a lot . '", "summary": " output fell by 0.4 per cent after extra bank holiday for the royal wedding last year . . but economy still grew .   eurozone crisis could mean economy shrinks for three successive quarters , but olympics will provide boost .
