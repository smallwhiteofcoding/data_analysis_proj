{"text": "updated : . 07:36 est , 10 february 2012 . conjoined twin girls who were abandoned by their parents because they could not afford their care have been given new hope of surgery and returning home to their family . veena and vani , eight , were born joined at the head , but their parents left them in their local hospital in hyderabad , india because they could not pay their medical expenses . for eight years the girls have eaten , played and slept in one room at niloufer hospital and have been cared for by nursing staff . new hope : veena and vani , eight , have been living in niloufer hospital , hyderabad , india , for the last eight years because their parents were unable to pay for their care . hopes : the girls , eight , want to be separated but their parents have been reluctant to allow an operation because of the risk both may not survive . but now their parents , maragana murali , 45 , and wife naga laxmi , 40 , have finally given their consent for them to undergo an operation to be separated . naga said : ` i 've found it too hard to let doctors operate on my girls any earlier because they could n't give me any guarantees they would survive . ` they were healthy , happy and intelligent girls . i could n't sit back and play with their future and risk losing one . ` but now they 're getting older i realise they ca n't go on as they are . i 'm just praying they survive and they can come home to us . ' risks : parents maragana murali , 45 , and wife naga laxmi , 40 , pictured with their other two daughters bindhu , 11 , and sindhu , nine , have now agreed their twins can undergo surgery . naga laxmi was unconscious when her daughters were born in october 2003 . it was 15 days before she finally saw that her girls were joined at the head . she remembers breaking down in tears , devastated . ` for many months i could n't stop crying , ' she said . ` what had i done wrong ? my insides were breaking into little pieces every time i thought of them . ` we did n't want to leave our girls behind , but we had no choice . ` we barely had enough money to keep a roof over our heads never mind care and pay for all their medical bills . our only hope was that the hospital would save them . ' when doctors admitted an operation to separate the twins could not guarantee the survival of both girls , their parents halted the procedure . home : the girls have been leaving in a room at niloufer hospital , hyderabad , for the last eight years . veena and vani continued to stay in the hospital and they would visit them as often as they could as they raised their other daughters bindhu , 11 , and sindhu , nine . their parents would save up money to go and visit their daughters , costing them 2,000 rupees each time . but naga would stay at the hospital for three days because she found it hard to leave them again . ' i sometimes find myself sobbing as i make the dinner or wash the floor . ' i still cry at unexpected times because of what my famil is going through . for years it was easier to just live as we were , it was too hard to commit to a decision . ' earlier this year , niloufer hospital officials invited the parents for a meeting and they made the decision to risk an operation . operation : doctors at the hospital are now hoping to get an international surgeon with neurosurgery expertise to separate the twins . dr narendra kumar , a paediatric surgeon , is trying to find an international surgeon who specialises in neurology to perform the operation . he said : ` it has always been possible to operate on the girls because they both have individual brains . ` the problem lies with the one main blood vessel they share so it does have its risks . ' the girls have built up a close friendship with dr kumar . vani dreams of becoming an engineer and veena wants to be a doctor . dr kumar added : ` we do n't have any neurologists at this hospital so we have to look elsewhere . ` the girls dream of being separated so we hope their wish will come true soon .
