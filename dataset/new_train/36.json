{"text": "picking out the heat against the blazing beams of a parent star is like picking out a single candle among 10,000 - but scientists have picked up infrared rays from a planet 40 light-years away . but human beings are unlikely to be moving to 55 cancri e - at 2,000 degrees centigrade , the surface of the planet is hot enough to liquefy steel . researchers at mit and other institutions say the planet may lack reflective surfaces such as ice caps , instead absorbing most of the heat from its parent star -- much as earth 's dark oceans trap heat from the sun . scientists on a planetary-heat-seeking mission have detected the first infrared light from a super-earth ¿ in this case , a planet some 40 light-years away . from this data , scientists have now calculated 55 cancri e ¿ s radius -lrb- twice that of earth ¿ s -rrb- and the duration of its orbit -lrb- 18 hours , versus our leisurely 365 days -rrb- . using telescopes on the ground and in space , scientists examine light patterns from a star to determine the traits of any planets around it . periodic dips in starlight indicate that a planet has transited , or passed in front of , its star . from this data , scientists have now calculated 55 cancri e 's radius -lrb- twice that of earth 's -rrb- and the duration of its orbit -lrb- 18 hours , versus our leisurely 365 days -rrb- . while the stellar brilliance enables researchers to detect changes in starlight , it 's much trickier to detect light of any wavelength -- visible or infrared -- from the planet itself . ` this planet is so close to the star that it 's very strongly irradiated , ' says co-author brice-olivier demory , a postdoc in mit 's department of earth , atmospheric and planetary sciences . ` it 's like in the movie ` avatar , ' where pandora orbits the gas giant polyphemus . seeing polyphemus from pandora gives an idea of how big the star would look from 55 cancri e. ' the group obtained observations from nasa 's spitzer space telescope , which monitors infrared radiation emitted by objects in the solar system and beyond . demory and his colleagues trained the telescope on 55 cancri , observing the star during a six-hour window during which the tiny exoplanet passed behind it -- a phenomenon known as an occultation . demory measured the starlight before and after the planet 's occultation , discovering a minute dip when the star completely eclipsed the planet . to make sure the dip was n't merely a fluke , the team obtained three more sets of data for the same orbital window , and analyzed all four datasets together . ` when you stack all the data together , you see a beautiful dimming light that clearly shows the light from the planet that disappears , ' says co-author michael gillon , principal investigator of the spitzer telescope program . ` this is the first time that we see light from a planet that is that small . ' ¿ it ¿ s like in the movie ¿ avatar , ¿ where pandora orbits the gas giant polyphemus . seeing polyphemus from pandora gives an idea of how big the star would look from 55 cancri e ' say the researchers . from the planet 's infrared light , the researchers precisely calculated its temperature -- a scorching 2,360 degrees kelvin , or 3,700 ° f. with such high temperatures , demory posits that the planet is likely rather dark , having no reflective surfaces such as ice caps , and probably absorbs most of the heat given off by its star . the planet 's temperature may also give researchers a clue about its atmosphere . 55 cancri e orbits its star much like the moon circles earth , always presenting the same face . demory suspects that much of 55 cancri e 's heat remains on the ` day side ' of the planet , and that it would be difficult to circulate such high temperatures to the planet 's dark side : in other words , it 's unlikely that the super-hot planet harbors any strong winds . phil armitage , an associate professor of astrophysics at the university of colorado , says it 's extremely difficult for any instrument -- including the spitzer telescope -- to make a direct detection of an exoplanet . he sees the group 's detection as ` a great example of really pushing an instrument to its limits . ' he adds that the planet 's infrared light will help identify more characteristics from this particular super-earth . ; super-earths are fascinating objects because they do n't have any analogs in the solar system , ' armitage says . ` we do n't have a clear idea how they formed or even what they 're made of . it 's a mystery that requires data beyond the planet 's mass and radius to resolve . '", "summary": " first time infrared light from planet this small has ever been detected .   super earth is twice the size of ours .   surface of 55 cancri e - 40 light years from earth - is hot enough to melt steel .   planet may lack reflective surfaces such as ice caps - and absorb all of star 's heat .
