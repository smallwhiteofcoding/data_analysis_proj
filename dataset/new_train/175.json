' the couple and daughter rebecca , 26 , used to live on takeaway food most nights but now eat healthy meals in small portions . they both began considering surgery after a holiday in the dominican republic last year . mrs brassell said : ` we got talking to another holidaymaker who had recently had weightloss surgery and was very pleased with the results and that set me off thinking . ` when we got home , i said to david that i 'd been considering looking into having surgery and he actually said he 's been thinking the same thing . ' lifestyle change : mrs brassell , who works for asda , used to eat takeaway meals every night with her family , but now has small healthy dishes . in september last year , the couple went to see their gp . mrs brassell was referred to the bariatric surgery centre in darlington and mr brassell was advised to try medication first . she added : ' i think the hardest thing was walking into the seminar for patients who are thinking about having surgery . ` there were a lot of people there who were even bigger than me . it made me think ,  i am not alone  . ` david came along to support me at the seminar but we both felt even more strongly after the meeting and after receiving all the information , surgery was the best option for both of us . ` you have to be really committed to change , i had to lose 5kg before the surgery and meet with a dietician to discuss the lifestyle changes you have to make after the operation . ` since the operation i have lost 8st and i feel fantastic . i 've gone from a size 26 to a 14 . ' i used to eat sweets , takeaways , snacks and cakes , but now i have cereal in the morning and healthy meals . ` it is the best thing i have ever done , i feel like it 's a new lease of life and i 've started doing exercise , going to the gym , swimming and circuits . ' mr brassell said : ` it 's the simple things like being able to bend down to fasten your shoelaces and not having an aching back when you walk . ' he admitted that when he and his wife were overweight , he even had to help his wife put her bra on , joking : ' i must have been the only husband who spent more time putting his wife 's bra on rather than taking it off . ' the couple urged anyone who is struggling with obesity to talk to their gp about a possible referral for surgery on the nhs . the darlington bariatric surgery centre has operated on 30 patients since it opened in september and many more are being prepared for surgery . spending on nhs weightloss surgery in the north-east has soared in recent years and the region has the highest rate of of hospital admissions for patients with obesity problems at 40 per 100,000 people . in 2008-09 , # 1.7 m was spent on weight-loss surgery in the region , but that more than doubled to # 3.6 m in 2009-10 and rose again to 4.6 m in 2010-11 . the brassells ' surgeon akeil samier said : ` it is very pleasing to hear the success stories of our patients and to see the difference the surgery has made to the quality of their lives . ` debra and david know patients need to work hard to achieve the weightloss results that they want , but it does work and provides a long-term solution . ' before undergoing gastric surgery for weightloss , patients need to have a body mass index of more than 40 , or more than 35 if they have other medical problems such as high blood pressure . mr samier added : ` these patients will have tried everything beforehand and will have failed with conservative methods . they must be committed to the follow up and to changing their lifestyle and eating habits after the operation , just as david and debra were .
