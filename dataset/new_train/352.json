' israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has condemned the officer 's actions . he said : ` this behaviour is not characteristic of idf -lrb- israel defence forces -rrb- soldiers and commanders and it has no place in the idf or in the state of israel .

' the attack , the channel said , would presumably trigger a war in northern israel , with missile attacks . he added : ` there will be no tranquility and peace anywhere in israel .
