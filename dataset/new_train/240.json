' a spokesman for lothian and borders police said : ` lothian and borders police road policing unit work closely with the nhs to establish the authenticity and credibility of any agency claiming to be carrying out work on their behalf when caught speeding . ` the decision to prosecute a driver for any motoring offence is made by the procurator fiscal .
