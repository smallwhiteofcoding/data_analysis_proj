{"text": "american children eat as much salt as adults -- about 1,000 milligrams too much , or the same amount as in just one big mac -- with its effects in some cases tripling children 's blood pressure rates . while extra salt is already linked with higher blood pressure , even in kids , government research says those who are overweight and obese may be the most vulnerable to its effects , according to the new findings from the centers for disease control and prevention . previous research has shown similar results in adults but studies on salt , weight and blood pressure are scarce in children , the research published in the journal pediatrics on monday revealed . consumption : the recommended daily salt or sodium intake for kids and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon daily , or about 2,300 milligrams though on average , kids were found consuming 3,300 milligrams daily . the cdc researchers looked at data on 6,200 kids aged 8 to 18 involved in 2003-08 national health surveys . the children were asked twice over several days to detail all foods they 'd eaten the previous day ; the researchers calculated salt intake from their answers . overall , 15 per cent had either high blood pressure or slightly elevated blood pressure called prehypertension . those who ate the most salt faced double the risk of having elevated blood pressure , compared with those who ate few salty foods showing that for every 1,000 mg of extra sodium in the children 's diets , a one-point increase in blood pressure was found . among overweight or obese kids , the risk was more than triple , showing that for 1,000 mg of sodium consumed , there was a blood pressure increase of 1.5 points . the recommended daily salt or sodium . intake for kids and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon daily , or about . 2,300 milligrams . on average , study kids ate 3,300 milligrams daily . according to previous data from the cdc , . u.s. adults consume 3,466 mg of sodium per day by comparison . too much : children were found eating about 1,000 milligrams too much of salt daily , equaling the same amount as in just one big mac -lrb- pictured -rrb- . cdc . researcher quanhe yang says it 's unclear why heavier kids would be more . sensitive to salt but it could be due to obesity-related hormone . changes . the results raise concerns because studies have shown that elevated blood pressure in childhood , even just prehypertension , can lead to full-fledged high blood pressure in adulthood and potentially premature heart disease . ` we should n't underestimate the potential harms of a 1-mm increase in systolic blood pressure , ' said dr. frederick kaskel , chief of pediatric nephrology at children 's hospital at montefiore in new york who was involved in the research . ` the antecedents of adult cardiovascular disease are seen early on in the pediatric age group . ' prehypertension and high blood pressure in children younger than 17 depend on age , height and gender . in those 18 and up , readings between 120 over 80 and 140 over 90 are prehypertension ; 140 over 90 and higher is high blood pressure . while health authorities across the globe warn consumers to cut back on dietary salt , a number of recent studies have suggested that not getting enough salt can be as harmful as getting too much . getting a rise : for every 1,000 mg of extra sodium in children 's diets , a one-point increase in blood pressure was found while for overweight or obese children there was a blood pressure increase of 1.5 points . the salt industry has pounced on that research , saying the dietary guidelines for sodium intake are flawed and should be withdrawn . dr. michael alderman of the albert einstein college of medicine in new york cautioned that it 's not clear that cutting back on sodium will do most kids any good . ` there is nothing in this paper - and there is no information that i 'm familiar with - that suggests reducing sodium intake is of value for people eating an average of 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day , ' he told reuters health . alderman said he has been an adviser to the salt institute , which represents the industry , and received $ 750 from the group in 1995 . he said he has no ties to the group today . graf said bread is the biggest source of dietary sodium in the u.s. , adding that deli meats also contain a lot of the ingredient . eating a healthy diet - including whole grains , vegetables , fruits , and fresh fish and meats - will automatically reduce sodium intake , she noted .", "summary": " children were found consuming 1,000 milligrams too much according to study by the centers for disease control and prevention .   the recommended daily salt intake for children and adults is no more than 1 teaspoon -lrb- 2,3000 mg -rrb- .   survey found kids consuming 3,300 mg daily or 160 mg less than adults .
