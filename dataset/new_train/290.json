{"text": "the callousness of metal thieves has hit new depths with the theft of a memorial to two children murdered by the ira . last night the father of one of the victims expressed his ` utter disgust ' at the ` despicable ' crime . colin parry denounced the heartless thieves who stole the plaque commemorating the 1993 warrington bombings , which killed his son tim , 12 , and another child , three-year-old johnathan ball . the death of the two boys touched the heart of the nation and mr parry received an obe for his peace campaigning after the atrocity . father 's anguish : colin parry and his son on holiday , a year before tim was killed at the age of 12 . the plaque -lrb- right -rrb- put up in memory of tim and the other victim johnathan ball , 3 , has been stolen by scrap metal thieves . police say the a3-size plaque could have been sold for scrap for as little as # 30 . it is the latest in a series of abhorrent thefts of memorials by criminals exploiting the soaring value of scrap metal . war memorials , lead from church roofs and cables from railway lines have been targeted . each year , at least 15,000 tons of the 13million tons of metal sent for scrap is believed to be stolen , worth an estimated of # 800million . last night mr parry -- who received an obe for his active role in the peace process after the bombings -- said : ` it makes me feel utter disgust and it is reprehensible that someone should disfigure what is a memorial to two young boys and see it as something they can make money from without any consideration for the families who lost loved ones . ` it beggars belief that people can be so heartless and i do n't expect that they have any conscience . ` it is remarkable the lengths that some people will go to make some cash and it is one of those crimes that is so off the scale that it is disgusting . ' the warrington bombings consisted of two separate attacks -- the first in february 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the cheshire town . in the second attack , the samaritans received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in liverpool . in the event , there were two blasts , in litter bins outside boots and argos , within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion . johnathan ball was killed almost instantly and tim parry was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine . more than 50 other victims were injured , with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass . bombing victims : johnathan ball , aged three , and tim parry , 12 , who were killed in the blast in warrington in 1993 . the bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren . mr parry , 65 , a human resources consultant , said of the thieves : ` even if they are really hard up it is without any justification . ` it really upsets me that they have disfigured something which symbolises a horror which took place in our town and has been worked on by many local youngsters . ` it leaves an awful taste in my mouth that they must have snuck in , in the middle of the night and just taken it without any regard for the people that suffered . they did not give a moments thought to the significance of what they had just stolen . it is despicable . ' his wife wendy , 54 , said : ` it 's really sad to think that anyone would even think about stealing or defacing a memorial of any kind . tim and johnathan had so much to live for and i wonder whether the person who stole the plaque ever gave them and the 56 other people injured a second thought . ` it is a sign of the times , i suppose , but there are other ways to make money without hurting those who had the misfortune to be caught up in that dreadful day . ' the bombings triggered a campaign for peace , with mr and mrs parry -- who have two other children -- working tirelessly to promote greater understanding between britain and ireland . they set up a peace centre in the town and played an active role in the peace process in northern ireland , for which mr parry was given his obe in 2004 . tragically , the parents of johnathan ball never recovered from the death of their son and they split up shortly after the bomb blast . johnathan 's father , wilf ball , 69 , died from a suspected heart attack in 2004 and his body lay undiscovered for two days . the boy 's mother , marie comerford suffered a fatal heart attack on the 16th anniversary of her son 's murder with the coroner saying she died of a broken heart . stolen : this is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the ira blast was placed . police are today hunting for the people who took it . the bronze plaque , which depicts the course of the river mersey as it flows through the borough of warrington , reads : ` the central water feature is in part a memorial to two local children who died following the terrorist bomb explosion in bridge street in 1993 . young people helped the artist with the design work . ' helen jones , labour mp for warrington north , said : ` this is a callous theft which shows no regard for the families involved or for other warrington people who were injured in the bombing . ` warrington is very proud of the way it conducted itself after the bombings and the way it did n't turn to hatred and instead worked constructively for peace . but these thieves have trashed the reputation of the town and ought to be ashamed of themselves . ' david mowat , conservative mp for warrington south , said : ` i am utterly disgusted by how low these mindless vandals have stooped . ' liz antrobus was 22 when she and her 29 year-old fiance gordon edwards were blown into the air by the blast of the second bomb . they suffered horrendous injuries and spent months in hospital but were married in 1994 in a ceremony attended by bomb victim tim parry 's mother , wendy . yesterday mrs edwards , 40 , said : ` it 's awful , absolutely awful and i do n't know why someone would want to do something like that . it is irrelevant that it happened so long ago because the events on march 20 1993 still have an impact today . ' resident amy edwards , 34 , said : ` this is one of the most shaming crimes . they are nothing but sick vultures who have no respect . ' yesterday pc graham davies , of cheshire police , said : ` this plaque forms part of a memorial and is of great significance to the town . ' he urged scrap metal dealers who may have information or may have been approached to buy the plaque to contact police immediately . blast : the scene is cordoned off after two litter bins exploded outside a boots store and a mcdonalds . memorial : this river of life runs down bridge street , warrington , in honour of the two boys killed in the 1993 ira bomb blast . campaigner : colin parry , father of warrington bomb victim tim parry , with former secretary of state for northern ireland dr john reid . he is pictured at a peace centre in warrington he set-up after his son 's death .", "summary": " plaque honoured tim parry , 12 , and johnathan ball , 3 , killed in 1993 blast .   police hunt thieves who took memorial sometime between april 20 and may 5 .   victim 's father colin parry : ` it beggars belief that people can be so heartless ' "}
