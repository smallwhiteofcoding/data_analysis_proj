' in another incident , miss dawson claimed graham ran his fingers along her spine after she asked him a medical question . miss baxter said he ran his hand or fingers along the length of her spine , from her neck to a couple of inches above her coccyx . she added : ` this touching was not necessary to answer the question and she was shocked and uncomfortable at the closeness of dr graham and the fact that he had touched her in what she regarded as quite an intimate way .
