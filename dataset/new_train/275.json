' mr jones added there were dramatic differences in temperature levels between places caught in the wave of downpours and those just outside . he said the north yorkshire seaside town of scarborough , which had 0.3 in -lrb- 7mm -rrb- of rain in an hour yesterday afternoon , only saw a high of 13c -lrb- 55.4 f -rrb- today , whereas at bridlington , just a few miles down the coast , temperatures hit 21c -lrb- 69.8 f -rrb- . the highest rainfall figure was in shap , cumbria , which saw 1.4 in -lrb- 36mm -rrb- in 12 hours yesterday and 2.4 in -lrb- 62mm -rrb- in 24 hours . mr jones said the narrow band of exceptionally heavy rain had now moved out to the north sea and the more general rainy weather was moving towards scotland . while britain has battled through torrential downpours and unrelenting rain in recent weeks , those in australia have been lapping up record conditions of a far more enjoyable variety . sun worshippers were spotted in the australian city today basking in temperatures of 29.1 c - the warmest day in may for more than 70 years . only three days in the last summer have been recorded as warmer in sydney , and there has been no rainfall recorded in the city this month . lapping it up : two sun seekers top up their tans in sydney , where peak temperatures of 29.1 c have seen the hottest may day in 70 decades . despite being autumn in sydney , only three days have been warmer this summer , according to experts . weatherzone meteorologist doug fenton told the sydney morning herald the temperature of 29.1 c at observatory hill in sydney was the hottest day in may since 1942 . he said : ` we 've had a high pressure system which has been planted directly overhead , ' mr fenton said . ` that 's brought some sunny skies over the last few days and really allowed surface temperatures to heat up . ` we 've also had north to northwest winds bringing in that warmth from the interior ... that meant we 're seeing the heat build up over the last few days .
