{"text": "brave captain scott before his ill-fated journey . it is a tale of adventure and bravery that ended in tragedy . but a theory about robert falcon scott 's ill-fated expedition to the south pole sheds a rather more sinister light on the subject . academic chris turney , of the university of new south wales , sydney , says one of the team may have eaten more than his fair share of food , leaving the others starving . on their way to the antarctic , the adventurers stored depots of food and fuel to sustain them on their return journey in february 1912 . but mr turney has discovered archive material suggesting the men found less food than expected at a critical point on the way back . he suggests that this was because teddy evans , scott 's second-in-command and one of three men who turned back before the final stretch , ate too much food . starving and exhausted , scott and three other men died just 18 kilometres from their final food depot . had they reached it , they probably would have survived . although it is already known that adventurers found food and fuel supplies unexpectedly low at some of the depots , mr turney claims he has new evidence of a further shortage . he also claims that this has been hushed up over the years and that a wife of one of scott 's team erased notes her husband had made . his claim is based on notes from two meetings in april 1913 between george curzon , president of the uk 's royal geographical society , and the widows of scott and team member edward wilson . in the first meeting , kathleen scott pointed out entries in her husband 's diary complaining about food shortages and the ` lack of thoughtfulness ' of other members of the expedition . polar party : intrepid captain scott , oates , wilson and evans are pictured besides amundsen√≠s tent on their daring journey . the ` terra nova ' , the ship that carried robert falcon scott on his exploration of the antarctic . in a separate meeting , oriana wilson told curzon that her husband 's diary contained a passage complaining of an ` inexplicable ' shortage of food on the return journey on which he died . mr curzon also noted that mrs wilson was determined to keep the notes secret and that notes had been erased , possibly by the widow . mr turney believes wilson was referring to a depot that scott and the surviving men reached on 24 february 1912 . he lays the blame with mr evans , who travelled south with scott but turned back alongside two other men with about 200km to go . captain scott on board the terra nova with some of the expedition members and crew . officers and crew pose at the stern of the terra nova , one of history 's most famous ships , in new zealand , 1910 . mr evans fell ill with scurvy on the return journey and had to be pulled on a sledge by his two companions , which may explain why they needed more food . mr turney also argues that this was all hushed up by mr curzon . he said : ` curzon could not risk the story getting out . scott and his companions had been declared heroes . ` to suggest that one of the returning teams had helped themselves to more than their fair share of food , contributing to the men 's deaths , would have changed everything . ' scott 's diary for february 24 mentions a significant fuel shortage and , three days later , he writes that the team had less food than they expected to have . mr turney makes the claims in his book 1912 : the year the world discovered antarctica , published this week . but roland huntford , author of a dual biography of scott and his norwegian rival roald amundsen , disagrees that mr evans can be blamed . he said : ` the food depots were badly organised and it would have been all but impossible for evans and his men to know how much food was rightfully theirs . ` it was entirely scott 's fault because of poor organisation .
