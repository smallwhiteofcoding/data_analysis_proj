{"text": "long after the guns fell silent at antietam , the earth yielded up gruesome reminders of the bloodiest day of the american civil war : bodies , bones , buttons and entire severed limbs -- one of which is now the focus of intense study at the national museum of civil war medicine . a sharpsburg-area farmer is said to have found the human forearm while ploughing a field two weeks after the 1862 battle . officials at the museum in frederick , maryland , are trying to learn more about the limb in hopes of verifying that it 's a relic of the battle of antietam and exhibiting the well-preserved specimen during the battle 's 150th anniversary in september . the muddy-looking right forearm , with skin and hand attached , was donated anonymously to the museum earlier this year , said executive director george wunderlich . relic : the severed arm , believed to be from the september 1862 battle of antietam , was donated anonymously to the national civil war medicine museum after having been displayed for decades at a private museum . it had been displayed for several decades at a private museum in sharpsburg in a glass-topped , pine case with a placard reading , ` human arm found on the antietam battlefield . ' though there is little hope of identifying the young man who lost it , mr wunderlich said forensic experts may be able to discern his nationality and whether the arm was , as mr wunderlich suspects , torn from his body by a bullet or artillery round . ` being able to put the story of this unknown person before this country is very important to us , ' mr wunderlich said . ` his remains will tell a story that will relate us back to his sacrifice . this was what they gave for what they believed . if done properly , it 's a very poignant story . ' the unidentified farmer who found the limb put it in a barrel of brine , according to thomas mcgrath 's 1997 book , maryland september : true stories from the antietam campaign . the farmer reportedly gave it to a boonsboro physician , who is said to have more permanently preserved it with embalming fluid . bloody , bloody : the battle of antietam took place across a bridge in western maryland , and is considered the bloodiest one-day battle in american history . casualties : bodies await burial in front of dunker church antietam . the battle was the bloodiest day in american history with over 20,000 casualties . the arm eventually ended up in a private museum that was sold in the 1960s to john g. ray jr. . after ray died in 2001 , his widow had the museum 's contents sold at an auction , according to battlefield historian ted alexander . alexander grew up nearby and remembers seeing the arm on display . ` it was quite an attraction , ' he said . ` it was macabre and something to see as kid . ' the arm 's owner was probably a small man less than 20 years old , said william gardner , a former marshall university forensic medicine instructor who examined it in march . all dead : the bodies of confederate soldiers killed during the battle of antietam lie along hagerstown pike . since the elbow joint is undamaged , with no surgical saw marks , the arm was likely removed somewhere between the shoulder and elbow , he said . the forearm skin and tendons appear to have been violently twisted . more than 23,000 soldiers were killed , wounded , or missing after the 12-hour battle of antietam , called the bloodiest one-day battle in american history . it took place on september 17 , 1862 across rural fields in western maryland . it was the first invasion of the north by confederate general robert e. lee and his army , the army of northern virginia . president abraham lincoln , speaking two days before the battle , gave the union his blessing , saying : ` god bless you , and all with you . destroy the rebel army if possible . ' the battlefield 's history and geography offer clues about how a solitary arm could end up buried in a farm field . ` that entire battle took place in people 's fields , their yards , ' mr gardner said . the pivotal clash on september 17 , 1862 , left more than 23,000 soldiers dead , wounded or missing in the war 's bloodiest one-day battle . historians say some were blown to bits by the furious gunfire . many were buried were they fell , their shallow graves crudely marked for their eventual removal to cemeteries . some remains were never retrieved . in 2009 , a battlefield visitor found bone fragments and uniform buttons of an unknown soldier from new york state . but it 's rare to find bones still covered with skin . ` it is really an impressive piece , ' mr gardner said . museum curator lori eggleston said she 's keeping the arm dry and handling it as little as possible on the advice of experts at the mutter museum , run by the college of physicians of philadelphia . a piece of history : the national civil war medicine museum is located in frederick , maryland . healing hands : the museum documents how doctors treated soldiers on and off the battlefield 150 years ago . mr wunderlich said he hopes to have a smithsonian institution forensic anthropologist examine the arm for clues about the owner 's diet and origin . battlefield superintendent susan trail said the arm ca n't be displayed at the antietam visitor centre because the national park service generally forbids displaying human remains . but she said the medical museum could display it at the pry house , a field hospital site that the museum runs on the battlefield . ` i 'm sure the museum will do a very nice job with what they do with it , ' ms trail said . ` when you think about it , it 's pretty awful what happened here -- and you just multiply it many , many times over .
