' the teacher responds that she was not aware of mr obama being a bully . she begins to raise her voice telling the student not to make ` degrading ' comments . the student tries to reply : ` if you 're going to talk -lsb- about -rsb- romney ... ' but he is interrupted by the teacher , who starts shouting . ` uh-uh ! stop ! stop ! no ! because there 's no comparison . he -lsb- mr romney -rsb- is running for president . obama is the president . ' the student , not satisfied with that answer , went on to say : ` if you 're going to talk trash about one side , you got ta talk trash about the other . ' however , the teacher disagreed . she said , ` let me tell you this : you 've got to realize this man is wanting to be what obama already is , ok ? ' she continues , screaming : ` that 's disrespect ! that 's disrespect ! ' ` stop ! no ! ' : when a student asked whether obama was ever a bully , the teacher angrily demanded that the student say nothing negative about him . the student contends that the teacher is the one being disrespectful - to mr romney . this infuriated the teacher . she insists that the student follow her rule . the teacher cried out : ` you will not disrespect the president of the united states ! ' the student retorted : ` i 'll say what i want . ' she angrily counters : ` not about him you wo n't . ' as the exchange went on , the student told the teacher that he had different beliefs than her and when he asked a question about mr obama and bullying , the teacher got ` defensive ' and ` freaked out . ' ` no comparison ' : when the student asked why it was ok to discuss mitt romney , the teacher said he should be treated differently as a candidate . then he tries to reason with the teacher that plenty of people have talked badly about president george w. bush . the teacher answered that the student needed to stop slandering the current president because ` people were arrested for saying rather poor things about bush . ' unconvinced , the student offers his viewpoint : ` you would have to say some pretty f *** ed up crap ... to be arrested . ` they can not take away your right to have your opinion or your freedom of speech . they ca n't take that away ... unless you threaten the president . ' the teacher demands to know whether the student was aware that the police do not always read miranda rights when a person gets arrested . ` they ca n't take that away ' : the student did not believe the teacher when she said people have been arrested for talking bad about george w bush . the student responds : ` well , i 've never been arrested . ' after some minimal discussion on how government officials sometimes say negative things about presidents , the teacher make her case that negative comments about mr obama will not be tolerated inside her classroom . school officials who have reviewed the video say they will not share the teacher 's name because it is a personnel matter . the woman has not been removed from the district . in a statement to the salisbury post , district spokeswoman rita foil said : ` this incident should serve as an education for all teachers to stop and reflect on their interaction with students . ' political analyst michael bitzer told the news agency that he was not aware of any arrests of people for negative comments they made about mr bush . he said : ' i think what this broke down to was a perceived personal slight by an instructor against someone she sees in a positive view , and things just went out of control from there .
