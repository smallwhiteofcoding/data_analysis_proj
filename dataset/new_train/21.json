{"text": "the army psychiatrist charged in the deadly fort hood shooting rampage told a judge on thursday that he chooses to defy army regulations by not shaving his beard because it follows his religious faith . it was maj nidal hasan 's first time speaking in court since showing up with a beard in violation of army regulations in june , prompting several fines and questioning for his defiance . ` in the name of almighty allah , i am a muslim , ' hasan told col. gregory gross in his response to the judge . ' i believe my religion requires me to wear a beard . ' the beard : maj nidal hasan is seen left , before the 2009 shooting that killed 13 at the fort hood , texas base with him seen more recently , right , while refusing to shave on reasons of his religious faith . hasan said his beard was not a show of disrespect to the court . the pretrial hearing was the first since a military appeals court stopped proceedings aug. 15 to consider the dispute over hasan 's beard less than a week before his court-martial was to begin . gross held hasan in contempt of court and fined him $ 1,000 for a sixth time on thursday , and again sent him to a nearby room to watch the rest of the proceedings on closed-circuit television . ' i am not trying to disrespect your authority as a judge , ' hasan said before his latest removal from the courtroom . ` when i stand before god , i am individually responsible for my actions , ' he said , apparently referring to the beard . hasan faces the death penalty if convicted in the november 2009 attack that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen others on the texas army post . gross , who has said he would order hasan to be forcibly shaved before the trial if he did not get rid of the beard himself , said thursday that he will order a forcible shaving next week . that will delay the case again because hasan 's attorneys can appeal before a decision is made on whether he 'll be forcibly shaved , gross said . contempt of court : hasan , seen after charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder , is held in contempt of court for his beard which could be forcibly shaved . earlier this week , the u.s. court of appeals for the armed forces ruled that hasan 's appeal was premature because gross has not issued a definitive order for hasan to be forcibly shaved . the court said that if gross issues that order , he must address several issues , including whether the religious freedom restoration act applies in the court-martial . some witnesses for prosecutors and defense attorneys may testify at another pretrial hearing at fort hood next week to address those issues . hasan 's attorneys have argued that forcing him to shave would violate his religious freedoms . they also have said hasan would n't shave because he had a premonition that his death is imminent , and does n't want to die beardless because he believes not having one is a sin . according to military regulations , soldiers who disobey orders to be clean-shaven can be forcibly shaved . gross has said he wants hasan in the courtroom during the court-martial to prevent a possible appeal over the beard if hasan is convicted . hasan is paralyzed from the waist down after being shot by police on the day of the rampage , but appears to have full use of his arms . prosecutors have said they do n't believe that religion is hasan 's motive , noting he was clean-shaven at the time of the shootings .", "summary": " maj nidal hasan fined six times for the beard that violates army regulations .   hasan told a judge on thursday the beard is required by his muslim faith .   according to military regulations his beard could be forcibly cut .
