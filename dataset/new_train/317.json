{"text": "the queen today wore a traditional floral dress to launch a very modern resource - a website made up of the journals of her great-great-grandmother victoria . dressed in a high-necked turquoise and purple frock and pearls , the monarch used a remote control to reveal the site on a screen in buckingham palace 's throne room . more than 40,000 pages of the diaries kept by queen victoria from the age of 13 until just before her death have been published . royal writings : the queen launches an online collection of the private journals of victoria today , accompanied by curator of the royal collection , lady jane roberts , at buckingham palace . you 're not seeing my diary ! the monarch meets bodleian librarian sarah thomas during a reception to launch the queen victoria journals online . but the queen provoked laughter when she commented , ` mine 's not being published . ' the royal archives , bodleian libraries at oxford university and online publisher proquest scanned the pages - some in victoria 's own hand and some edited and transcribed by her daughter beatrice after her death - for the six-month project marking the diamond jubilee . queen victoria wrote of the scenes that greeted her during a parade to mark her own 60-year reign : ` passed through dense crowds , who gave me a most enthusiastic reception . it was like a triumphal entry . we passed down cambridge terrace , under a lovely arch bearing the motto , ` our hearts thy throne ' . ` the streets were beautifully decorated , also the balconies of the houses with flowers , flags , and draperies of every hue ... the streets , the windows , the roofs of the houses , were one mass of beaming faces , and the cheers never ceased .

' interestingly , victoria wrote on her diamond jubilee about sending a message electronically . ' i touched an electric button , by which i started a message which was telegraphed throughout the whole empire , ' she wrote . ` it was the following :  from my heart i thank my beloved people , may god bless them .  ' the twitter account @queenvictoriari will be active during the jubilee period . the online release of the diaries , which have been transcribed up to the year 1840 , mark the start of a year-long programme to digitise work from the royal archive . the queen was forced to rebuff bodleian librarian sarah thomas when asked if she herself wrote a diary . dr thomas said it had been ` an amazing honour ' to work on the journals , which include sketches and paintings drawn by victoria to illustrate the books . she said : ` we have been motivated by the intrinsic value of these collections and the idea of sharing them . ` it amplifies the excitement we have in having her majesty herself come here , because it shows she has a real interest . she was obviously engaged . ` this is a part of history . it is such an exciting moment , when you can unlock history and make it publicly available . ` the eyes of the world are focused on the queen and the diamond jubilee - and this is the other diamond jubilee .
