{"text": "we have all gone to lengths to avoid people we do n't like - but it appears a group of tigers in nepal have adopted a ` night shift ' to better co-exist with their human neighbors . the lives of the tigers and people of chitwan national park fly in the face of long-held convictions in conservation circles - both sharing exactly the same space , including the same roads and trails . jianguo liu , director of the center for systems integration and sustainability , and phd student neil carter spent two seasons setting motion-detecting cameras to observe tigers , . their prey and people who walk the roads and trails of chitwan , both in . and around the park . chitwan , nestled in a valley of the himalayas , is . home to about 121 tigers , while people live on the park 's borders , but rely on . the forests for ecosystem services such as wood and grasses . the chitwan national park is home to elephants , rhinos , leopards and tigers - and people who live among the wildlife . ` captured by the lens ' : phd student neil carter set up multiple cameras to monitor tigers around the nepal site . the local chinese population also use the same routes through the forest , but both species seem to function fine on different ` shifts ' the roads also are used by military patrols to . thwart would-be poachers , and all who venture on the dirt roads and narrow footpaths are ` snared ' on carter 's . digital memory cards . carter 's analysis of the thousands of images show that people and tigers . are walking the same paths , albeit at different times . tigers typically . move around at all times of the day and night , monitoring their . territory , mating and hunting . but in the study area , carter and his . colleagues discovered that the tigers had become creatures of the night . the camera 's infrared lights document a pronounced shift toward . nocturnal activity . people in nepal generally avoid the forests at . night . essentially , quitting time for people signals starting time for . chitwan 's tigers . student neil carter on the trail : his cameras allowed remote monitoring of users of the path . so far , it appears tiger population numbers are . holding steady despite an increase in human population size . ` it 's a very fundamental conflict over resources , ' carter said . ` tigers . need resources , people need the same resources . if we operate under the . traditional wisdom that tigers only can survive with space dedicated . only for them , there would always be conflict . ` if your priority is . people , tigers lose out . if your priority is tigers , people lose out . ' but he added : ` conditions for tigers in chitwan are good . ` prey numbers . are high , forests outside the park are regenerating , and poaching of . tigers and their prey is relatively low . ` however , people of different . stripes , including tourists and local residents , frequent the forests of . chitwan . ` tigers need to use the same space as people if they are to . have a viable long-term future . what we 're learning in chitwan is that . tigers seem to be adapting to make it work . ` there appears to be a middle ground where you might actually be able to . protect the species at high densities and give people access to forest . goods they need to live . ` if that 's the case , then this . can happen in other places , and the future of tigers is much brighter . than it would be otherwise .
