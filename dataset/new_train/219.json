' i knew . there was a sniper out there and i was looking for him . it happened . very quickly - i put my head up and he got me . ' i ca n't remember much after i . was shot . but i must have been determined to get the sniper as the guys . said i continued firing at him , even though i was in and out of . consciousness . ' pte . paterson eventually collapsed and lay . helpless on the roof until a paramedic came to his rescue . he added : ` the next time i woke up i . was in a hospital in birmingham . ' the medic - nicknamed mother by fellow soldiers of 4 scots , the royal regiment of scotland - shielded the stricken soldier with her body as they were sprayed with heavy gunfire and ricocheting bullets . royal navy reservist michelle ping , 37 , from leeds , was later mentioned in dispatches in recognition of her gallantry . saved : the 22-year-old shows a surgery scar lined with staples following an operation to fit hiim with a titanium plate under his scalp . grisly souvenir : pte paterson holds up a bag containing pieces of his skull that were removed after he was hit by a taliban sniper . he said : ` as soon as she saw my eyes she thought i was dead . but she told me she shouted at me  i 'm not having that  and she shook me back to life and looked after me . ` i 'm so grateful for what she did . she saved my life . we 're best of friends and she is coming up to aberdeen next friday to see me to see how i 'm getting on . ' pte paterson suffered a brain injury as the bullet drove through a neat puncture in the front of his helmet and punched a large exit hole at the back . he was then airlifted to kandahar , where an american surgeon carried out a delicate operation on his head , removing a piece from the top of his skull and inserting a titanium plate held in place by 32 tiny screws . ` we 're best of friends ' : pte paterson , shown following his recovery , wears a leg support after his injury left him with weakness in his right side . his life was saved thanks to the efforts of brave medic michelle ping -lrb- right -rrb- . highland warrior : pte paterson , from inverurie , aberdeenshire , pictured on duty in afghanistan . he was three month into a tour of the turbulent helmand province when he was shot . pte paterson said : ' i now have a metal plate in my skull - although i have kept the piece of my skull in an envelope upstairs as a war souvenir . ` i 've tested the metal plate to see if it magnetic , but it does n't seem to be . i do n't know yet what effect it may have on airport security metal detectors . ' after the operation in kandahar , he spent three days in an induced coma before he was flown back to britain . he spent a month in a birmingham hospital before being transferred to a military rehabilitation unit in surrey for seven months , where he was told his stubborn scottish nature helped his speedy recovery . ready for action : the young soldier in full battle gear before he was nearly killed in afghanistan . giving back : pte paterson in the customised bike he will ride in a 510-mile challenge in aid of the soldiers , sailors , airmen and families association . despite now having a severe weakness in the right side of his body , craig is happy to be alive and wants to give back to the charities which helped save his life . when the highlander returned home a few weeks ago he immediately signed up to raise cash for the soldiers , sailors , airmen and families association by doing a five-day , 510-mile ride of britain cycling event in september on a specially adapted bike . he said : ' i have been getting in training around an inverurie to monymusk circuit . it 's another challenge but i 'll do it to help ssafa continue their great work . it meant so much to us to be together .
