' the government blames much of the debt on botched pfi deals which were encouraged by the labour government . these enabled private firms to pay up front for a new cancer ward or maternity department , for example , and the trust would then pay them back in yearly instalments . last week it was announced south london healthcare - responsible for queen elizabeth ii hospital in woolwich , pictured - was being put into special measures as it is on the brink of going bust . but this amount goes up with interest every year and trusts also have to spend large amounts of money maintaining the buildings so they are ` new ' . as such , many have been unable to make these repayments . the nao warns that in future , the nhs will not be able to afford to continue bailing these trusts out . it points out that there is unlikely to be any increase in government spending on the nhs - once inflation is taken into account - for at least the next three years . the future of south london healthcare trust is uncertain but health secretary andrew lansley is likely to make a decision later this year . it covers three hospitals - princess royal university hospital in orpington and queen mary 's hospital in sidcup in kent and the queen elizabeth hospital in woolwich , south london - and any may be closed-down .", "summary": " taxpayers ' money spent on bailing out hospitals has trebled .   south london trust on the verge of going bust .   government blames labour pfi deals .   margaret hodge mp describes figures as ` shocking ' "}
