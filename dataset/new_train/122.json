{"text": "updated : . 03:46 est , 2 february 2012 . pay cut ? alan hansen is going to broker a deal to saty on match of the day . match of the day 's team of highly paid pundits are facing drastic reductions in their salaries as part of the bbc 's economy drive . alan hansen has agreed to take a # 500,000-a-year pay cut when he signs his new contract in the next few days . and it is understood that alan shearer , mark lawrenson and lee dixon -- along with presenter gary lineker -- will also face salary reductions when they discuss new deals . hansen 's pay has been the subject of controversy after it was revealed he was earning # 1.5 million a year for his comments . # 500,000 would represent a 33 per cent pay cut . sources have suggested that the former scotland international ` voluntarily ' agreed to the reduction , saying that he was no different from sir bruce forsyth or graham norton in having to ` stomach ' big salary drops . they said he ` did n't complain ' and was keen to stay on , adding that compared with most people in the industry he was still ` on a very good deal ' . it is understood that lineker , who is thought to be on about # 2million , does not come up for contract renewal until august next year . again it is expected he will follow suit with a significant reduction to his deal . the other pundits are expected to face cuts of about 20 per cent because they are paid less -- shearer is believed to be on # 500,000 a year . under fire : as the bbc is forced to make slashing cuts to its budgets stars of prime time shows have come under scrutiny for their huge salaries . career : hansen may have used his reputation on the field , which included 26 scotland caps and three european cup wins , to justify his earnings -lrb- pictured playing for liverpool in 1970s -rrb- . the revelation that hansen was receiving about # 40,000 per show angered viewers and politicians . bbc director general mark thompson has tried to defend the deal by comparing hansen to top tv entertainers of the past , such as morecambe and wise . but it would appear there is a growing realisation that defending such high pay is hard to sustain when the bbc is facing 20 per cent cuts and getting rid of about 2,000 jobs . a source said : ` on-screen talent is not immune to economic pressures facing the bbc . ' life for hansen , lawrenson and shearer has been made easier with match of the day 's recent move to salford . both hansen and lawrenson live in the north west , while shearer 's home is in the north east , although it is less convenient for lineker , who is based in the south east . not alone : jeremy paxman and graham norton have also been asked to take pay cuts in cost cutting measures .", "summary": " bbc confirm former scotland international will take a ` considerable ' cut to his # 1.5 m salary .
