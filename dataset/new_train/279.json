{"text": "` good experience ' : thief alister lamb -lrb- pictured -rrb- faces jail after missing his community service appointments because he was taking part in the jeremy kyle show . a thief is facing jail after he went on the jeremy kyle show instead of doing his community service . alister lamb was convicted last year of stealing a string of items including a toilet seat from a flat in dundee . on november 11 last year , sheriff tom hughes imposed 200 hours of unpaid work in the community as part of a community payback order instead of sending lamb to jail . but lamb - who has previous convictions for cannabis possession and assault to injury - completed only one hour of work between that date and april 10 this year . and when asked by social workers why he had n't done the work he told them he had missed appointments because he had been filming an episode of the jeremy kyle show . he had gone on the show in a bid to get access to his daughter from a previous relationship . despite now facing a period in custody , lamb said : ` it was a good experience . ' lamb , 23 , of baldovie terrace , dundee , previously admitted a charge of theft by housebreaking . he and another man broke into a flat occupied by william wallace in whitfield avenue , dundee , between february 11 and 12 last year . they stole a television , an xbox console and accessories , ornaments and a train set . bizarrely , the pair also stole a toilet seat in the raid . in a report submitted to dundee sheriff court outlining the breach of his order , social workers said : ` it would appear that mr lamb has not afforded his orders due priority which is evidenced by his continued failures to attend . ` his most recent evidence to cover absences was an appearance on tv , namely the jeremy kyle show . ` he reports that he now has access to his children which he contributes to his recent appearance on the jeremy kyle show . ` there has been no other substantial changes in his circumstances that should preclude him from attending . ` mr lamb again has not afforded his order due priority . ` this despite having been granted extensive periods of time in which to submit evidence . ` no commitment to order ' : lamb said he was a ` really nervous ' during the filming of the jeremy kyle show . the episode he appears in has not yet aired . ` even when evidence has been submitted and accepted ' i have no option but to call in to question his commitment to his order given the most recent evidence used was an appearance on the jeremy kyle show . ` i therefore have no alternative but to request that court consider revoking said order in view to imposing an alternative disposal . ' lamb would have faced a jail sentence when he appeared in court for sentence today , but he failed to attend court at 9.30 am . sheriff tom hughes granted a warrant for his arrest . lamb then turned up at court at 10.40 am , but was told his case could not be recalled . outside court , lamb said he had been transported to and from the filming of the show by taxi and had been put up in a hotel by producers . he said : ` i was n't that good , i was really nervous . it was a good experience though . ` i watch the jeremy kyle show on the telly , so i thought i 'd phone them . ` i was trying to get access through the lawyers , but i thought i 'd try this instead . ' a spokeswoman for the jeremy kyle show said the episode lamb was involved in has not yet been aired .", "summary": " alister lamb convicted of stealing toilet seat from flat .   given 200 hours community service , but only did one .   said he skipped appointments due to filming on show .   was due to be jailed today ... but missed his hearing .
