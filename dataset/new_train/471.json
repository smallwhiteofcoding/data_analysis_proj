{"text": "the football association today admitted it must do more to tackle racism in football as it prepares to interrogate john terry over allegedly abusing rival player anton ferdinand . a report by a powerful committee of mps today warned problems still exist with racism in the game , with twitter acting as a new platform for abuse . next week terry will face an independent panel after he was charged by the fa of using racially abusive language towards ferdinand last october . he denies the charge . queens park rangers ' english defender anton ferdinand -lrb- left -rrb- avoided shaking hands with chelsea 's defender john terry -lrb- right -rrb- before saturday 's match between queens park rangers and chelsea at loftus road . he was found not guilty by westminster magistrates court in a criminal trial , but faces another fight to clear his name next week after being charged by fa chiefs . tory mp john whittingdale , chairman of the culture , media and sport committee , said : ` recent incidents of racist abuse in the uk , both on and off the pitch , have highlighted the fact that there remain significant problems . ' he said social media has become a ` tool for the spread of racist and abusive content , but it is also a potential means of combating the ignorance and prejudice that lie behind such behaviour ' . football authorities should use online forum to spread ` positive messages ' about equality and diversity , he added . ` more needs to be done to increase the diversity of the pool of candidates for coaches and referees , to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels of the game . ' in response to the committee 's report , the fa said much progress had been made to tackle racism in the game but there remained room for improvement . in a statement the fa said : ` we agree with the committee that whilst substantial progress has been made to promote equality and tackle discrimination in the game , challenges remain for all of the football authorities . ` we remain committed , along with all of our stakeholders , to promoting equality and diversity within the game and to the eradication of all forms of discrimination in football . ` we will continue to work across the entire breadth of the sport to deliver our inclusion and anti-discrimination agenda . in doing so , we will consider in detail how the committee 's recommendations can support and influence this work . ' john terry was acquitted of abusing queens park rangers defender anton ferdinand in a criminal trial at westminster magistrates court but was later charged by the football association . the report also called for more candidates from ethnic minorities to be trained as coaches and referees , with more transparent recruitment of managers and directors to encourage greater ethnic diversity . but it stopped short of recommending the rooney rule be adopted - the system used in american football in the nfl where shortlists for any head coach or senior management vacancy have to have at least one ethnic minority candidate . piara powar , executive director of european anti-discrimination network fare , said the mps had missed an opportunity to set out clear ways of achieving more black managers and coaches . powar said : ` there have been headline issues that english football has experienced over the last year , the luis suarez and john terry cases , and those are very big issues that we need to deal with . ` but the report had no clear direction on diversity hiring practices .  we now have less racism in football because people respect the achievements of black players but where is their role in the game as coaches and managers . football needs to be given the lead . ` we have a significant asian population in britain but where are the asian players ? '", "summary": " culture , media and sport committee says twitter is fueling the problem .   next week john terry will face an fa panel over alleged racist abuse aimed at anton ferdinand .   campaigners say mps should have focused on how to get more black managers into the game .
