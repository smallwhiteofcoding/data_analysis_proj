{"text": "every ant species known to mankind will soon be chronicled in high-definition 3d . a team of u.s. scientists is on a mission to visit museums around the world and catalogue detailed images of every ant in their collections . the study , which is being led by dr brian fisher from the california academy of sciences , is the first time that researchers have photographed the insects in such fine detail . camponotus planatus : a team of u.s. scientists is on a mission to visit museums around the world and catalogue detailed images of every ant in their collections . extreme close-up : the study is the first time that researchers have photographed the insects in such fine detail . their new microscopic imaging technique provides scientists with a hitherto unglimpsed look into ants ' anatomy . on their ` world ant tour ' , the scientists will add their findings to a database called antweb , a detailed resource that , it is hoped , will prove invaluable to insect researchers . dr fisher told the bbc : ` our goal is to image 10,000 a year . ' the researchers have so far photographed 8,000 ant species from collections at museums in the u.s. and are aiming to image up to 30,000 . they are currently visiting the natural history museum in london to chronicle the more than 6,000 species held in its vaults . at each stop , the team images several specimens of each species , so that the database is as complete as possible . this involves photographing different sexes and ant castes - queens , soldiers and workers . brachymyrmex brevicornis : the new microscopic imaging technique provides scientists with a hitherto unglimpsed look into ants ' anatomy . on their ` world ant tour ' , the scientists will add their findings to a database called antweb , a detailed resource that , it is hoped , will prove invaluable to insect researchers . each preserved ant is subjected to dozens of highly-magnified photos at different levels of focus . this data is then fed into a computer and a 3d image is built , one that allows scientists to explore each ant 's anatomy in never-before-seen detail . dr fisher told the bbc : ` you can zoom in and see fine hairs , the eyes , all of this detail . and all of this , under a microscope , is not in focus . ` so this is actually the first time , as a scientist , i get to see this ant in 3d . ' the antweb imaging archive will not just be available to scientists . as dr fisher explains , ` anyone , anywhere and at any time ' can log in and sample the research . main man : the study is being led by dr brian fisher from the california academy of sciences . database : each preserved ant is subjected to dozens of highly-magnified photos at different levels of focus .", "summary": " u.s. scientists will add their detailed images to huge database called antweb .   they have so far imaged 8,000 species and aim to capture up to 30,000 .
