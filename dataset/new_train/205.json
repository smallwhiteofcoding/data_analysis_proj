{"text": "a german schoolboy 's life has been saved by his parents who each gave up one of their lungs as he grew closer to death . marius schneider , 12 , is now on the mend after undergoing the historic op - the first of its kind undertaken in europe - by specialists in hanover . marius is a cystic fibrosis sufferer ; victims often suffer chronic lung and respiratory problems . the only hope for him were donor lungs as he struggled for breath each day . on the mend : cystic fibrosis sufferer marius schneider , pictured with his family , is now on the mend after undergoing the historic double lung transplant in hanover . success : marius schneider answers questions during a press conference alongside his mother , sister and professor axel haverich , germany 's most famous transplant surgeon . cystic fibrosis is an incurable genetic condition making the body produce mucus thicker than normal which gradually fills the lungs , reducing and eventually stopping the ability to breathe normally.the condition , normally detected at birth or early childhood , carries the symptoms of salty tasting skin , poor growth and weight gain despite a normal diet , accumulation of thick , sticky mucus , frequent chest infections and coughing or shortness of breath.cystic fibrosis can be managed , but if the lungs decline to such an extent that a patient 's life is threatened doctors may decide to perform a transplant . finding a donor is tricky because people with cf must have both lungs replaced to prevent the remaining lung infecting the new lung with bacteria . ` we were desperately waiting for an organ , waiting for a call every day , ' his father lars said . by the time of the operation in april he was surviving with the aid of a ventilator and a heart-lung machine . he was flown to the hospital in hanover on friday april 13 from his home in southern germany and had the operation 13 days later . ` for him , 13 seems to be a bit of a lucky number , ' added mr schneider . ` the transplant was his last chance , ' said dr gregor warnecke , the doctor in charge of his care . ` the hospital would not have operated on his parents if it had not been an absolute necessity . ' professor dr axel haverich , germany 's most famous transplant surgeon , said : ` marius was already somewhere between heaven and earth when we operated . he was living in a state of almost perpetual anaesthesia . but he is a real fighter . we had a team of 40 and he came through . ' marius was lucky on two counts : both of his parents had compatible blood groups , and their lungs were bigger than his , which is necessary for a successful transplant . ` if we had enough organ donors in germany , the doctors would not have to resort to living donors , ' mr schneider said . ` we are happy and thankful that we and the doctors were able to help marius . ' he and marius ' mother anja had no doubts about each donating a lung to save their boy . ` it was immediately clear what we had to do in order to save our son , ' she said . this or nothing : dr gregor warnecke demonstrates how the operation will work . he had said the transplant was marius ' last chance . crack team : surgeons at the hannover medical university performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed from each parent and then implanted into marius . the procedure took close to six hours . surgeons at the hannover medical university -lrb- mhh -rrb- performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed from each parent and then implanted into marius . the procedure took close to six hours . ` the operations went well , the parents were able to leave hospital after ten days , ' added dr warnecke . ` the transplantation worked well with marius . we were able to remove the tubes from him two days after the operation . ' marius was released from hospital after 155 days . and although his quality of life has improved enormously -- he can play football and ride his bike -- his immune system remains weak and he is being tutored at home . marius , whose sister nele shares his love for schalke football club , said : ' i am especially proud of my parents . they gave me their lungs so i could live . now i can keep up with them on bike rides . ' while this was the first procedure of its kind in europe , doctors say it will probably remain an exception because of the need for two donors at a time with the requisite blood groups .", "summary": " marius schneider suffers from cystic fibrosis .
