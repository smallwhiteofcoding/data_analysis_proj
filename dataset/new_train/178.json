{"text": "a five-year-old boy has taken his first steps - after a ` miracle ' drug helped shrink a giant and deadly tumour that was raging through his body . alfie milne has a growth spanning his entire right leg , pelvic area , bowel , part of his stomach and lower spine . it is so big that surgeons are unable to remove it , and until recently he could only get about in a wheelchair . but after taking an experimental drug to . treat the incurable condition - which is through to affect just 500 . people worldwide - alfie has been given a new lease of life and last . month he took his first steps . new start : alfie milne is now walking after an experimental drug stopped a tumour from growing in his body . he was diagnosed with a rare lymphatic disease at great ormond street hospital in 2010 -lrb- right -rrb- . his mother tracy , 39 , from aberdeen , said : ` it 's amazing . the difference was almost overnight . ` he went from being a child who spent most of his time on the sofa because he was in so much pain , to a very happy little boy who loves being in the thick of it . ` he wants to play football , wrestle , bounce on the trampoline , and climb trees . he sometimes forgets he 's not able to do all these things but he still wants to give it a go . nothing stops him . ' alfie was diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis , a rare and invasive disease caused by a malformation of the lymphatic system , when he was just 18 months old . it has also left him with brittle bones and his blood does not clot properly , which causes internal bleeding . but against all odds , alfie 's condition has seen a marked improvement since he started taking trial drug sirolimus . he no longer has to visit the hospital every week . the drug is more commonly used as an anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant patients , last september . mrs milne , who also has son lewis , nine , said : ` as far as we are concerned it ' s a miracle drug . i ca n't believe how happy and healthy alfie is today . ` he is getting stronger every day . ` we 've been able to wean him off all his pain relief , an mri scan showed the tumour has reduced in size and it has n't spread . ` it was spreading really quickly and was going up into alfie 's spine but it has n't gone any further . that in itself is fantastic . ` the ultimate goal is to find a cure but this is a breakthrough . it gives us hope . ' alfie 's mother tracy -lrb- pictured -rrb- said : ` this drug is giving alfie the quality of life he should have ' alfie was just six months old , when mrs milne and her husband mark , 43 , noticed his leg appeared swollen when he was in his baby walker . he was eventually diagnosed a year later at great ormond street hospital . alfie 's right leg remains swollen and is around three times larger than the left one . the disease is also making his right leg grow at a faster rate and it is 5cm longer . however alfie , who until recently had to take morphine to combat the pain he was in , has a special shoe with a built-up sole to aid his balance . mrs milne said : ` we 've got him pain free and balanced and he has been able to take his first steps unaided . ` it was very emotional . he just stood up and said : ` mummy , look at me ' , and took three steps . ` he even made me keep it a secret from his dad because he wanted to practice before he showed him . my husband shed a few tears when he saw him walking . ' along with the trial drug , alfie also takes potent cancer drugs once every seven weeks and steroids twice a day to help his blood clot . it is hoped his next session of chemotherapy next month will be his last and that in time he will also be able to come off the steroids . alfie , at nine months old , before he was diagnosed . his parents were concerned that one of his legs appeared swollen . mrs milne now hopes alfie , who was five last month , will be able to walk into school , when he starts there after the summer holidays . she said : ` it 's a major milestone . we did n't really think he would get to mainstream school or even get to school .  i 'm just so happy he is joining in and doing what he 's supposed to at five years of age . ` he 's a cheeky little character who is always laughing and playing with his brother and asking to have friends around . it 's fantastic he can just be a little boy . ' however , they know there is no guarantee that the drug 's success will continue indefinitely . the family has now set up a charity in their son 's name to help raise money for lymphangiopmatosis and gorham 's disease alliance europe . the organisation aims to fund research for a much-needed cure for the disease , which has a low life expectancy , with only some sufferers surviving 10 years or more . mrs milne said : ` this drug is giving alfie the quality of life he should have and we 've got to hold on to that . ` as long as his body can tolerate the toxins the drug produces he should be able to stay on it , hopefully , for the rest of his life . ` but they do n't know what side affects there could be . we just have to take it one day at a time . ` something like this teaches you not to look too far into the future . we just have to live for today . ' since setting up alfie 's trust at the end of last year , they have raised more than # 40,000 . for more information visit www.alfiemilne.org.uk .", "summary": " drug has stopped spread of tumour and alfie has been weaned off pain medication .   the drug is more commonly used as an anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant patients .   ` it gives us hope ' , say parents .
