{"text": "updated : . 04:35 est , 21 june 2011 . women hit hardest by controversial changes to the state pension age will be given a lifeline , ministers confirmed last night . iain duncan smith , the work and pensions secretary , told mps that ` transitional arrangements ' will be made to help those most affected . his apparent concession comes after the daily mail repeatedly highlighted how women in their late 50s would be affected more than any other group by cost-saving increases in the pension age . concessions ... but iain duncan smith failed to say exactly what will be done to help or how many women will benefit . only yesterday it emerged that senior lib dem ministers told the treasury that some kind of compromise was ` inevitable ' to soften the blow . mr duncan smith repeatedly signalled that concessions will be made . he also said he would ` happily look at transitional arrangements . ' but he failed to say exactly what will be done to help or how many women will benefit . at present , a woman can start receiving her state pension at the age of 60 years and seven months . a man must wait until he is 65 . under the changes , the age will reach 65 for both men and women in november 2018 -- and will rise to 66 by april 2020 . devastated : barbara bates will be forced to work for an extra two years . mp yesterday waved through the change when the pensions bill received its second reading after the government offered to hold talks with critics about how the change would be introduced . it was given a second reading by 302 votes to 232 , government majority 70 . women are the biggest losers from the changes , with around 2.6 million having to wait longer before their pension begins to be paid . but mr duncan smith insisted that it would affect only a ` relatively small number of women ' and that delay would cost the taxpayer # 10 billion . he offered to hold ` discussions ' with mps over the ` transitional arrangements ' , but maintained : ` we stand by the need for men and women 's state pension ages to equalise in 2018 . ` and both will rise together so the state pension age reaches 66 in 2020 . this bill will go forward on that basis . ` if we delayed the move to 66 until 2022 it would cost the taxpayer # 10 billion - an unfair financial burden borne disproportionately by the next generation . ' of the total , around 500,000 will have to wait more than a year and 33,000 will have to wait exactly two years . there is broad agreement on the need to equalise and raise state pension ages , which were first set in 1926 . but mps on all sides say it is unfair that one particular group of women will be hit so hard , losing as much as # 15,000 each . dame anne begg , labour chairman of the work and pensions select committee , even warned that the proposals risked creating a ` new poor ' of women forced on to benefits until they reach the new state pension age . former conservative justice spokesman eleanor laing urged the government to think again . ` no one can object to the equalisation of pension ages when we 're fighting so hard on other areas of equality , ' she told mr duncan smith . ` you are absolutely right to do what you 're doing . ` but will you recognise that there is a particular group of women -- some 300,000 of them -- born in 1954 for whom the transition arrangements are rather more difficult than they are for any other group of society ? will you look at other ways of helping that particular group of women ? ' liberal democrat work and pensions spokesman jenny willott said the legislation currently did not ` pass the fairness test ' . but she insisted it was worth backing and that changes could be made to improve it . former labour welfare minister frank field said the coalition was right to seek to make savings . he suggested pension age increases for both men and women after 2020 could be accelerated slightly to pay for easing the burden on women in their late 50s now . as reported in yesterday 's mail . this idea was also raised by government sources last night . it could cause resentment , but most pension experts agree ten years ' notice of relatively minor changes would be sufficient . in his response , mr duncan smith said he would ` happily look at transitional arrangements ' . it is not clear , however , whether these will apply to the 33,000 biggest losers , or the larger number of 500,000 women . dr ros altmann , director general of saga , said : ` the ideal solution would be to revise the timetable . tinkering is better than nothing but we need to see the detail . ' campaigners yesterday warned the government could face a legal battle if changes were not made . experts raised the threat of a judicial review because it is ` unreasonable ' to force through such high-speed changes to women 's state pension age . labour 's pensions spokesman rachel reeves accused the government of ` clearly breaching ' its coalition agreement . that document said the state pension age would not be increased ` sooner than 2020 for women ' . in fact , it is starting to rise in 2018 . but tory richard drax accused labour of failing to deal with the pensions ' crisis when in power . he said : ` it has long been apparent that something had to give . our national longevity has increased by an average of ten years since the 1970s . ' quentin letts : yesterday in parliament . for decades we have been told that women must be treated equally . many a bra was burned to a frilly crisp . germaine greer cabbaged away about little else for the best part of 40 -lrb- or was it 50 ? -rrb- years . chaps had their ears boxed for gawping at miss world and domestic rolling pins were wielded like johannesburg sjamboks . mrs letts even took up diy . now , hooray , we ardent feminists have something long overdue to celebrate . the state pension age for men and women is to be made equal . female pensioners will no longer be given preferential terms . hard stare : yvette cooper did n't much like iain duncan smith 's plans for pension reform . equality for all ! strike up the internationale ! but what happens ? politicians are in uproar , talking about how ` unfair ' it all is . you ca n't win . iain duncan smith , pensions secretary , played things sotto when he came to the commons yesterday afternoon . he opened the chamber 's doors to find row upon row of crosspatches sitting there , steaming like a kitchen of chinese saucepans . arms were crossed . fingers were being drummed . uh-oh . the house had a mood on . mr duncan smith has never been one of life 's shouters -- it makes him cough -- so he did not try to pick a fight . he did try one or two tiny jokes but soon dropped that tactic . wise . as many an errant man has been told , ` do n't think you can laugh me out of it -- it is n't funny ! ' mr duncan smith faced the likes of labour mps fiona mactaggart -lrb- slough -rrb- , joan walley -lrb- stoke on trent n -rrb- and frontbenchers rachel reeves and yvette cooper . the editorial board at spare rib magazine was scarcely more formidable . ids 's reluctance to become openly hostile was understandable . even neanderthal man knew when not to risk life and limb . all but the most novice circus tamers resist baiting a lioness when her tail is twitching . shadow home secretary miss cooper was there simply out of interest , or maybe peevishness , for pensions is no longer her realm . she gave mr duncan smith one of those chilling , old-fashioned stares , the like of which no chap can ever fully ignore . you may know the type of glare . it is like being bored into by a black and decker . miss reeves stepped up to the despatch box repeatedly to give it an imperious whack . mr duncan smith took her interventions . she did not like what he told her , but at least he had given vent to her fury . the reeves voice is a forceful instrument . put a bag over your head and she could be twin sister of the late and masterly bernard bresslaw . as a former opposition leader , mr duncan smith has a certain insurance policy . he is coated by that special varnish westminster reserves for those who have failed in lofty office . lack of success makes them popular . and so mr duncan smith found some of his critics opening their sallies with little preambles about what an admirable fellow he usually was . labour 's rachel reeves , left , and fiona mactaggart were among the mps that mr duncan smith had to face . thanks to his tact , the house did not ignite . indeed , when his shadow , liam byrne , later spoke from the despatch box , there may have been increased warmth towards the secretary of state . mr byrne was dismally partisan and seemed barely to grasp the necessity of pensions change . as ids explained , longevity has made a nonsense of the sums . when the state pension system started , it was on a ratio of nine people working to every pensioner . this is now three to one , and will soon be two to one . it 's actually pretty amazing that no government has seized the issue beforehand . mr duncan smith said that ` responsible government is not always easy government ' and claimed that ` we will stay the course ' . yet he also said that he did ` not rule out a discussion ' about how to help women born in 1954 , who may be unlucky in the way the adjustments are made . that sounds as though a cop-out is being prepared . ca n't we just send them some flowers instead and promise to take them to the pictures ?", "summary": " pensions bill given a second reading by 302 votes to 232 , a government majority 70 .
