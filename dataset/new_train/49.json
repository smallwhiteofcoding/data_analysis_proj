{"text": "payoff : former barclays bank chief operating officer jerry del missier has received a cash payoff worth almost # 9million . a barclays boss who resigned in disgrace over the interest rate rigging scandal has been handed a cash payoff worth almost # 9million , it emerged last night . jerry del missier will receive the # 8.75 million windfall despite ordering traders to manipulate crucial interest rates used to set mortgages and trillions of pounds in complex investments . barclays was fined # 290million by us and uk regulators over the scandal last month , leading to the resignation of chief executive bob diamond and chairman marcus agius . news of the windfall emerged on the day that alison carnwath -- chairman of the bank 's remuneration committee which sets bonuses -- also quit for ` personal reasons ' . it is not known whether her resignation was in protest against the award for mr del missier , which is set to spark another row about the bonus culture in the city . deborah hargreaves , chairman of the high pay commission , said : ` this is staggering . why on earth should this man get a multi-million pound payoff for resigning in disgrace ? this is further proof that the whole system of bonuses needs to be urgently reformed . ' it is thought that the canadian banker 's award represents just over half of a potential # 17million long-term incentive award made to him several years ago and which matured in march . the payoff could spark further anger over the bonus culture in the city . jerry del missier , bob diamond 's former right-hand man , giving evidence to the treasury select committee at the house of commons last week . insiders say mr diamond 's former right-hand man and chief operating officer was persuaded to delay receiving the bonus because of escalating public anger over pay . the windfall is thought to have been settled on to secure mr del missier 's signature on his severance package . it comes despite promises from barclays , and led by alison carnwath as the executive in charge of pay at the bank , to claw back bonuses from mr diamond and fellow directors . bob diamond , former chief executive of barclays , walked away with a # 2million package . mr diamond forfeited bonuses worth up to # 20million amid a growing public outcry but still walked away with a # 2million package . but mr del missier 's decision to pocket the cash will mean he will join his former colleague as a lightning rod for criticism over rewards for failure . earlier this month he was identified as the barclays executive who instructed junior colleagues to rig benchmark libor rates , used to set mortgages , during the financial crisis . in an appearance before the treasury select committee of mps last week he claimed he was instructed to do so by mr diamond following a phone call between his former boss and paul tucker , deputy governor of the bank of england . tom powdrill from shareholder lobby group pirc , said : ` this is enough to make you sick . barclays must make it clear immediately if there was any discretion involved in this settlement , and if so they should make clear which directors approved it . ` in any case this decision is likely to incense shareholders , particularly if any of the payoff includes rewards relating to the period in which the bank was involved in libor manipulation . ' barclays refused to comment . but the bank is understood to have felt it could not legally claw back the cash payout to mr del missier , given he was entitled to receive it in the spring . it is unclear whether he will be able to keep separate share options thought to be worth tens of millions of pounds .", "summary": " jerry del missier receives payment despite resigning over ordering traders to manipulate interest rates .   he instructed junior colleagues to rig benchmark libor rates - used to set mortgages .   claims he was told to do so by former chief executive bob diamond .
