{"text": "updated : . 12:32 est , 5 october 2011 . a third of u.s. veterans of the post-9 / 11 military believes the wars in iraq and afghanistan were not worth fighting for , it has emerged . many of them also think that after 10 years of fighting america should focus more on its own problems instead of foreign affairs , according to an opinion survey . the findings highlight a dilemma for the obama administration and congress as they struggle to tackle the government 's huge budget deficits and reconsider defence priorities while trying to maintain public support for those still in iraq and afghanistan . ` not worth it ' : many veterans believe that after 10 years of fighting america should focus more on its own problems , according to the survey . human cost of war : almost 4,500 u.s. troops have died in iraq and about 1,700 in afghanistan with the combined costs of the conflicts topping $ 1trillion . almost 4,500 u.s. troops have died in iraq and about 1,700 in afghanistan with the combined costs of the wars since the september 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 topping $ 1trillion . the pew research center 's poll reveals the post-9 / 11 veterans are proud of their work but are scarred by warfare and convinced the american public has little understanding of the problems wartime service has created for the military and their families . the survey also showed that post-9 / 11 veterans are more likely than americans as a whole to call themselves republicans and to disapprove of president barack obama 's performance as commander in chief . they also are more likely than earlier generations of veterans to have no religious affiliation . the study was described as the ` first of its kind ' by the pew research center , a politically-impartial organisation which studies attitudes and trends . the survey was based on two polls conducted between late july and mid-september . one survey questioned 1,853 veterans - including 712 who had served in the military after 9/11 but are no longer on active duty . of these 712 post-9 / 11 veterans , 336 served in iraq or afghanistan . the second poll surveyed 2,003 adults who had not served in the military . nearly half of post-9 / 11 veterans said deployments strained their relationship with their spouses , and a similar share reported problems with their children . however , 60 per cent said they and their families benefited financially from having served abroad in a combat zone . the war veterans used words such as ` rewarding , ' ` nightmare , ' ` eye opening , ' ` lousy , ' when asked to descried their experiences . there are about 98,000 u.s. troops in afghanistan , where the conflict began with a u.s.-led invasion on oct. 7 , 2001 . obama campaigned for the presidency in 2008 on getting out of iraq and ramping up the military campaign in afghanistan . he is on track to remove all u.s. troops out of iraq by the end of this year , and in july he announced that he would pull 10,000 troops out of afghanistan this year and 23,000 more by next september . the pew survey found that veterans are ambivalent about the net value of the wars , although they generally were more positive about afghanistan , which has been a more protracted but less deadly conflict for u.s. forces . one-third of post-9 / 11 veterans said neither war was worth the sacrifices ; that was the view of 45 percent in the separate poll of members of the general public . fifty percent of veterans said afghanistan was worth it , whereas the poll of civilians put it at 41 per cent . combat zone : the survey reveals post-9 / 11 veterans are proud of their work but are scarred by warfare . among veterans , 44 percent said iraq was worth it . that compares with 36 percent in the poll of civilians . of the surveyed former service members who were seriously wounded or knew someone who was killed or seriously wounded , 48 per cent said the war in iraq was worth fighting , compared with 36 percent of those veterans who had no personal exposure to casualties . exposure to casualties had an even larger impact on attitudes toward the war in afghanistan . fifty-five per cent of those exposed to casualties said afghanistan has been worth the cost to the u.s. , whereas 40 per cent of those who were not exposed to casualties held that same view . pew said its survey results found ` isolationist inclinations ' among post-9 / 11 war veterans . about 6-in-10 said the united states should pay less attention to problems overseas and instead concentrate on problems at home . in a pew survey conducted earlier this year , a similar share of the general public agreed . the survey also reflected what many view as a troublesome cultural gap between the military and the general public . although numerous polls have shown that americans hold the military in high regard , the respondents in the pew research acknowledged a lack of understanding of what military life entails . only 27 percent of adult civilians said the public understands the problems facing those in uniform , and the share of veterans who said so is even lower - 21 percent .", "summary": " veterans believe america should focus on its on problems , poll reveals .
