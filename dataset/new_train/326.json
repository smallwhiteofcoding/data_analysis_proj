{"text": "being called upon to design for the queen is likely to be the highlight of any fashion designer 's career . but it could also herald the most daunting , indeed , terrifying moment in a couturier 's life . as revealed in a new book , elizabeth : reigning in style by jane eastoe , reprised in this weekend 's stella magazine , to be asked to supply sketches to the queen was a daunting prospect . dressing the queen : hardy amies , who designed the blue creation worn by the queen here , said he was frequently disappointed to see his ` beautiful designs ' ruined by what he called the queen 's ` ugly handbags ' couturiers , milliners and other designers would be contacted by the queen 's dressers and asked to provide sketches . frequently , they would receive no further detail -- no hint as to the nature of the event , or even the time of year the outfit would be required for -- making it very difficult to supply something precisely to her requirements . those who did pass muster would then have to attend a fitting with the queen -- a prospect that was in itself widely felt to be terrifying . daunting : milliner frederick fox says his first fitting with the queen was one of the most terrifying moments of his life . jane eastoe explains that upon his royal appointment in the late 1960s , the milliner frederick fox was briefed ahead of his fitting with the queen by one of her most trusted designers , hardy amies . he told fox : ` do n't touch the queen , do n't ask questions and do n't turn your back ' . eastoe tells how , on the day in . question , australian-born fox came into difficulties with the edict that . he must n't turn his back . ` the . queen was standing at the end of a long room , ' she reports him as . saying . ' i advanced , did my chat and my thing . when it was time to . depart i was rooted to the spot . i thought that if i walked backwards i . would fall over the furniture of one of the corgis . ` her majesty spotted my dilemma and turned her back on me to ask bobo -lsb- the queen 's dresser -rsb- to fetch some specific shoes - giving me the opportunity to withdraw . ' royal favourite : princess diana in a frederick fox hat . fox designed five hats for the queen 's tour of chile and argentina , and went on to design for the queen on numerous occasions . he was awarded a royal warrant in 1974 , as well as an lvo in the queen 's 1999 birthday honours list , making the hard work and trauma worthwhile . he has also designed headpieces for eight further royals , including the queen mother and diana , princess of wales . trusted : sir hardy amies designed for the queen from the 50s until 2002 , a year before his death - and advised frederick fox on his royal fitting . for amies ' part , despite his privileged position as one of the queen 's favourite couturiers -- he designed gowns for the queen from the early part of the 50s right up to a year before his death , in 2003 -- it was not always a bed of roses for a designer with a ferociously specific design aesthetic . eastoe tells how hardy amies , along with the queen 's other couturiers , despaired of her majesty 's tendency to pair their outfits with what they deemed to her ` ugly ' handbags that blighted their designs . she says that the queen 's formidable dresser bobo wanted to ensure no design house dominated the queen 's wardrobe , so she would outsource the design of hats , shoes and handbags to other designers which would then be matched to her outfits . hardy amies , she says , ` complained bitterly ' about ` ugly handbags ' that ruined his ` beautiful designs ' . his solution , which he claims was a popular strategy among her majesty 's dress designers , was to give the queen handbags they considered to be beautiful in the hopes she would choose to carry those instead . read more in this week 's stella magazine .", "summary": " frederick fox admits he was daunted by royal appointment .   queen 's tailor hardy amies confesses her ` ugly ' bags ruined his beautiful designs .
