' louis was transferred to leeds general infirmary where he was kept in intensive care for two weeks then put onto the children 's surgical ward . she added : ` the doctors said that if i had n't checked on him and spotted the rash when i did that louis probably would have died . ` the first 48 hours were touch and go and after that they gave him a 50 per cent chance of survival which gradually increased as the days went on .
