' currently uk pilots are limited to 18 hours without sleep - but more than 4 out of ten pilots -lrb- 43 per cent -rrb- already report nodding off in-flight - of whom a third -lrb- 31 per cent -rrb- awoke to find their co-pilot also asleep , mps heard in evidence . despite this , the department for . transport yesterday insisted the eu blueprint would neither compromise . safety nor increase the risk of pilot fatigue . new transport secretary patrick mcloughlin was accused of ¿ rolling over to brussels ¿ after his department approved the rules . in its official response to the mp 's report published yesterday the department of transport defended its backing of the eu flying hours plan and insisted : ` the government believes that the current draft of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- proposals will not lead to a diminution of safety in the uk . ` the proposals are more conservative than current eu rules which were introduced in 2008 and will result in a significant improvement in safety across the eu as a whole . ' but the british airline pilots ' association -lrb- balpa -rrb- has written to mr mcloughlin urging him to ` think again ' . a balpa spokesman said : ` it is clear that the government has chosen to ignore the concerns of thousands of pilots in the uk . it looks like the government are going to roll over to brussels on this . ` europe want british pilots flying more tired more often . so the government response is extremely disappointing . we hope the new transport secretary will change course . ' the row centres around new rules laid out by the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- which was mandated four years ago by brussels to ` harmonise ' flight time limits and shift-patterns across the eu . since the row erupted , brussels has signalled it may compromise on 20 hours . and despite accepting the new rules the government did accept some of the mp 's findings - including a recommendation to investigate ` the potential under-reporting of pilot fatigue ' . ministers said they would also be seeking a strengthening of specific eu ` fatigue ' rules surrounding flight duties and rest periods and ` stricter limits ' on how frequently airlines could use discretion to exceed maximum levels . transport committee chairman louise ellman , labour mp for liverpool riverside , said of the government 's response : ` there are still areas of concern . the jury 's out . the proof will be in their actions . ' a department for transport spokesman said : ` the safety of the travelling public is paramount and we have been quite clear that we would not support any proposals which the uk 's safety regulator - the civil aviation authority - advise do not provide sufficient protection against crew fatigue . ` we are still awaiting easa 's final proposals , but the caa is satisfied that the latest draft rules now provide a level of safety broadly equivalent to those already in place in the uk .
