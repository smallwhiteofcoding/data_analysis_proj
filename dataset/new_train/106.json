' the bullies may well have had a lucky escape . no one who watched malone propel the military wives to the number one spot last christmas with wherever you are could doubt the steel within his slight build . he said the real key was to give people the tools to deal with the problem themselves , which for him was in music and the arts . he is married to becky , an english teacher in an inner-city school , and they have a baby daughter , esther . but malone -- who ten years ago was an out-of-work music graduate -- has still suffered jokes about his sexuality . the star , who is on protein drinks to bulk up his muscles and goes to the gym , told radio times : ` it was slightly disappointing , after leaving school and leaving all that behind me from the age of about 15 to 30 , to come into television and discover  oh right , everyone is just as juvenile as the kids at school were !  ` i mean , i am fairly flamboyant and expressive , but i know plenty of gay people who are incredibly repressed and are n't showy and do n't like judy garland , you know . ' however , he said he had now ` exorcised his demons ' . expressive : gareth malone with members of the military wives choir , which he created himself . malone , who taught music to underprivileged children before dreaming up the idea for the choir , said it was difficult to get men to sing because they do n't want to make ` idiots ' of themselves and generally believe singing is only acceptable at football or in the bath . he added that he had often heard it said that singing ` is a bit gay ' or ` makes you gay ' or ` gay-ifies you ' . the military wives choir -- created by malone -- is made up of partners of service personnel who have been away at war . he is now filming another series of the choir to air later this year and has also shot a pilot for a new show in america , where the choir is being shown on bbc america .", "summary": " bbc star says taunts at school almost pushed him to violence .   star still receives jibes even after moving into television .
