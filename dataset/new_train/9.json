{"text": "perched on a special red chair in her hospital bed , this was tragic hayley fullerton just a few days before she died . bright-eyed and munching on a piece of toast , she was recovering well from heart surgery . and although the blonde-haired one-year-old was still underweight for her age , her parents and doctors had every hope she would grow to live a full life . heartbreaking : hayley fullerton is shown here recovering from surgery just six days before she died . there was no sign that just six days later she would be dead from a massive heart attack after doctors inserted the wrong size tube into her lung , causing it to collapse . her devastated mother paula stevenson , 40 , has blamed birmingham children 's hospital for her death , saying staff ignored the family 's repeated pleas to help her . hayley 's operation for a congenital heart condition was a success but the complications arose during her recovery . mrs stevenson has told an inquest into her death she spent several days trying to warn staff that her daughter was having trouble breathing . tragically , on november 11 , 2009 , both of hayley 's lungs collapsed and she went into cardiac arrest . tragedy : hayley died of a heart attack after doctors inserted the wrong sized tube into her lung . yesterday birmingham coroner 's court heard how hayley had seemed in good spirits on the paediatric cardiac ward of birmingham children 's hospital . nurse sheila bennett described how hayley had been sitting ` in a high chair eating breakfast and playing ' , in the week before she died . but when nurse bennett returned to work after the weekend , hayley was lying with her head in an oxygen ` headbox ' to help her breathe , and being fed through a tube . she told the court : ` i have n't got an explanation for hayley 's sudden collapse , but i can tell you that in 17 years of working on ward 11 , i have seen babies having sudden and inexplicable cardiac arrests . ' overlooked : paula stevenson told an inquest her one-year-old daughter was neglected at the hospital . the coroner heard from a succession of doctors and nurses who said hayley 's rapid deterioration had come as a shock to them . mrs stevenson has told the inquest she begged nurses to move hayley into intensive care , but was repeatedly assured this was unnecessary . at one point , she even tried ` bribing ' a nurse with # 100 to pay more attention to hayley , who was born in northern ireland . mrs stevenson told coroner aidan cotter : ` i could not believe that hayley had just been left to deteriorate . all along the family had expressed their concerns about hayley 's breathing and had even asked if there was a problem with her lungs , yet nothing was done . ` all she did was sleep . i missed my little girl so much and i felt as though i had n't seen her eyes in so long , her big blue eyes . ' hayley was born with a hole in her heart and was recovering from surgery when complications arose . describing the awful moments as her daughter 's life ebbed away , she said : ` i saw that hayley was really gasping for breath . ` her eyes were panic-stricken and they started rolling back in her head . ` hayley looked awful , she was like a fish out of water . she was gasping and gasping for every breath . ' paula stevenson , seen here with a picture of her baby girl hayley , says the staff at birmingham children 's hospital failed ` abominably ' mrs stevenson said there were around 15 people in the room working to save her daughter . she said : ` all the time i was stroking her head and telling her she was the best wee girl in the world . ` they worked on her until their hands hurt . all i could see was the monitor flashing -lsb- cardiac -rsb- arrest . ` all the time i kept squeezing her hand gently just to see if she would squeeze it back . hayley never squeezed my hand back . it was cold and lifeless . ` after 19 minutes everyone had stopped looking at hayley and they were now all looking at me with pity in their eyes . ` at 20 minutes -lsb- a doctor -rsb- confirmed my worst fears . he said ,  sorry mum , we 've lost her .  ` and all i could think about was that i was no longer a mummy because hayley was my only child and she was dead . i was in shock and utterly devastated . ` the treatment has led me to question how can the staff at birmingham children 's hospital fail hayley so abominably ? ' mrs stevenson and her husband bobby fullerton now live in australia , and have another daughter , one-year-old casey . the inquest was adjourned and is not expected to resume until september when expert medical witnesses are available .", "summary": " one-year-old hayley died after her lungs collapsed .   paula stevenson spent days trying to warn hospital staff about her daughter 's breathing problems .   she even tried ` bribing ' a nurse to get her to pay more attention .
