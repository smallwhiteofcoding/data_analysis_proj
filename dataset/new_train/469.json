' unlike last year 's dry conditions , the wet summer this year and recent warm temperatures means the trees are not shedding their leaves so early , she said . ` tinting is a little bit late , as we would expect . ' experts from the royal horticultural society have predicted that , when it does arrive , the weather conditions over recent months mean it will be a perfect autumn for colour . dr lewthwaite urged people to get out and enjoy woods this autumn , and said they could help experts understand how plants and animals are adapting to the changing environment by recording their sightings on nature 's calendar .", "summary": " sightings of ripe blackthorn , bramble and elderberries are down compared to this time last year .   only 17 reports of beach trees beginning to change colour compared to 302 for same time last year .   for more information on nature 's calendar , people can visit : www.naturescalendar.org.uk .
