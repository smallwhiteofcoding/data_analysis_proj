' the whittamore database records show that as a result of the ` claridges blag ' , information was obtained about a four-day hotel stay , in a room which cost # 411.25 per night . the total bill was # 3,433.98 . the records show that the hotel stay in question was in the month of july , but do not specify a year . upmarket : claridges hotel in mayfar , central london , where mr agostinelli ran up a # 3,433.98 bill . searches through media databases do not indicate that stories about agostinelli appeared in the news of the world in the period before or soon after the police raid during which whittamore 's records were seized . some years later , press articles did mention mr agostinelli as a member of a group which was interested in buying liverpool fc , but ultimately lost out to another american bidder . blow : rupert murdoch appears at the leveson inquiry , which is investigating the practices and ethics of the press . mr agostinelli appeared as no. 19 in the 2011 edition of an annual ` rich list ' published by murdoch 's sunday times . the paper said mr agostinelli was now ` london-based ' , with estimated wealth of # 625million , and counted former french president nicholas sarkozy as a friend . the journalist named in the whittamore database as having commissioned the private detective to investigate mr agostinelli , who now works for a different newspaper , said he had never heard of the tycoon and maintained that the database entry referring to him was inaccurate . mr agostinelli did not respond to messages left for him at rhone group offices in new york and london . a spokesman for claridges declined to comment . murdoch 's uk newspaper empire is the principal target of the leveson inquiry into the practices and ethics of the british press . a spokeman for news international said : ` the information ... was the subject of a report by the information commissioner 's office in 2006 and has been examined extensively by the leveson inquiry in recent months . news international has given detailed evidence on these matters .
