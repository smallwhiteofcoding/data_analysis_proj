{"text": "updated : . 16:54 est , 31 march 2012 . billionaire warren buffett believed the country 's richest should be taxed more to help decrease debt . billionaire warren buffett urged u.s. lawmakers to raise taxes on the country 's super-rich to help cut the budget deficit , saying such a move will not hurt investments . the 80-year-old accused congress of being ` billionaire friendly ' and claimed in an opinion article for the new york times that they spared him and his rich friends when talking about a ` shared sacrifice ' . he said : ` our leaders have asked for  shared . sacrifice  . but when they did the asking , they spared me . i checked with . my mega-rich friends to learn what pain they were expecting . they , too , . were left untouched . ` my friends and i have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly congress . ` it 's time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice . ' buffett , one of the world 's richest men and chairman of conglomerate berkshire hathaway inc , said his federal tax bill last year was $ 6,938,744 . ` that sounds like a lot of money . but what i paid was only 17.4 per cent of my taxable income - and that 's actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office . ` their tax burdens ranged from 33 per cent to 41 per cent and averaged 36 per cent , ' he said . lawmakers engaged in a partisan battle over spending and taxes for more than three months before agreeing on august 2 to raise the $ 14.3 trillion u.s. debt ceiling , avoiding a u.s. default . mr buffett said : ` americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of congress to deal with our country 's fiscal problems . ` only action that is immediate , real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness . ' he said higher taxes for the rich will not discourage investment and cited the example of the eighties when rates were much higher . buffett , one of the world 's richest men and chairman of conglomerate berkshire hathaway inc , said his federal tax bill last year was $ 6,938,744 . ` back in the 1980s and 1990s , tax rates for the rich were far higher , and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack . ` according to a theory i sometimes . hear , i should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the . elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends . ' i have worked with investors for 60 years and i have yet to see anyone - not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 per cent in 1976-77 - shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain . ` people invest to make money , and potential taxes have never scared them off . ' he also commented that raising taxes would create jobs , contrary to popular belief , saying : ` and to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation , i would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000 . you know what 's happened since then : lower tax rates and far lower job creation ' speaking on behalf of the country 's wealthy , he also said that the rich would not have a problem paying more taxes , if it meant they were helping the country out of a debt hole . ' i know well many of the mega-rich and , by and large , they are very decent people , ' he said . ` they love america and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them . ` many have joined the giving pledge , promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy . most would n't mind being told to pay more in taxes as well , particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering . ' msnbc 's pat buchanan challenged mr buffett 's editorial on ` morning joe ' telling him to put his money where his mouth is . he said : ` why does n't he set an example and send a check for $ 5 billion to the federal government ? he 's got about $ 40 billion . ` you know , you had a plan up there , i talked to howie carr at boston where the super-rich could contribute an extra amount . it was something like one-tenth of one percent did it . ` you get all this noise from these big rich folks . let them send checks and set an example instead of writing op-eds .
