{"text": "fears : lord coe talking to the mail on sunday . olympics chief sebastian coe has launched an outspoken attack on reality tv , warning that it could wreck britain 's hopes of producing future olympic champions . lord coe , who won his first olympic gold in 1980 , said shows such as the x factor encourage young people to think they can become ` famous for nothing ' . the chairman of the london organising committee of the olympic and paralympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- said : ' i do n't decry all reality tv . it identifies talent , but it encourages people to think you can be a celebrity in six hours . ' i joined an athletics club when i was 11 years old and did n't get to the olympics until i was 23 . ` we have to be careful we do n't create a celebrity-driven culture where young people think it is better to be famous for nothing than be anonymous for doing something creative . ' in an exclusive and wide-ranging interview with the mail on sunday , lord coe - who remains the only man to win gold in the 1500m at successive olympics - also spoke candidly about his ` tough ' school days and the extraordinary influence of his late father and coach . sleek and slim as ever at the age of 55 , wearing a pink shirt with the top two buttons open and reclining in his 23rd-floor office in london 's canary wharf , lord coe looks the archetypal , well-groomed city slicker . fame : simon cowell with fellow celebrity judge cheryl cole on the x factor . yet he failed his 11-plus and his was no gilded upbringing . ` if you were brought up in sheffield in the seventies , went to an inner-city secondary modern and your name was sebastian , you learned how to survive . it was tough . you learn to handle yourself . ' his steely core comes as much from his formidable father peter as it does from his native city . during the second world war , peter coe survived his ship being torpedoed . picked up by a german boat , he later escaped en route to a prisoner-of-war camp by leaping off a train and walking across the pyrenees to spain . but there he was jailed for six months for having the wrong papers . years later , he had a blazing row with a bolshie athletics official and his son commented : ` you do n't scare easily . ' peter , who died in 2008 , replied : ' i do n't scare at all . the last 43 years have been a f ****** bonus . ' when coe lost the 800m olympic final to his great rival steve ovett in 1980 , his father told him - and the world 's media - he had ` run like a **** ' . unlike modern budding olympians , lord coe 's only sponsors were his hard-up parents . gold rush : lord coe leads the 1500m semi-final , followed by spain 's jose abascal , at the 1984 los angeles olympics , where he won gold . ` it bred a hardier competitor , ' he says . ` no athlete is going to underperform in london because of lack of funding . the national lottery has changed the landscape . ' the words are said with feeling . however , he admits today 's youngsters have more distractions . ` when i first joined an athletics club , it was the focus of my world . there was little tv and no computer games . ' lord coe also touched on the possibility that sprinter dwain chambers , whose ban on competing because of a drugs offence was overturned earlier this year , could wear a gb vest at the 2012 games . ' i am unreconstructed on this , ' he says . ' i would like to see a life ban . if you take drugs to artificially enhance your performance , you are stepping out of the moral framework of sport . ' athletes on drugs who competed for the soviet union in lord coe 's heyday had an excuse , he says . ` they had no idea they were being given drugs at the breakfast table . ' of chambers , lord coe says : ` if he competes he should receive every courtesy . ' but he warns : ` drugs cheats should think very carefully before coming to london : we have the most advanced tests in any games . you run a serious risk of getting caught . ' overturned : dwain chambers runs the 4x100 relay in rome last month . turning to britain 's chances this summer , lord coe is far from confident about achieving the target of finishing fourth in the medals table , as in beijing , when we nudged australia into fifth place by a single bronze medal . ` you do n't have to give the aussies much of an excuse to get back at you . it 's in their dna . ' he says the germans , french , japanese and south koreans pose the biggest threat . lord coe 's steely core is again evident in his defence of his # 357,000-a-year salary as locog chairman . lord coe , who travels in a chauffeur-driven bmw 7 series , says he is worth it : on a typical day , he starts work at 7am and finishes at midnight . he also defends the ruthless way ` olympic police ' have stopped anyone else exploiting the games ' commercial potential . an east end kebab shop called ` olympic ' was forced to change to ` lympic ' . ' i am unashamedly protective of it , ' he avows . ' i have to protect the people who have put a lot of money into this . i am going to get this project across the line with a balanced budget so the public wo n't have to pick up the bill . ' rumours : lord coe 's judo sessions with william hague fuelled bogus rumours they were gay . lord coe was a tory mp from 1992 to 1997 and william hague 's chief of staff when the former conservative party leader was defeated in the 2001 general election . he became a peer in 2000 . his spell with hague is best remembered for their lunchtime judo sessions , which fuelled bogus rumours that they were gay . ` gay ? ' splutters lord coe , in fits of laughter . ` there was nothing weird about it . when william became leader , he said to me , ' i know how hard this job is going to be . i need to be in shape . what do i do ? ' i said , ` what sports do you like ? ' he said , ` martial arts .  lord coe arranged for them to wrestle on the judo mat , supervised by olympic silver medallist ray stevens . ` william got up to a blue belt . ' lord coe has four children by ex-wife , equestrian nicola mcirvine , and had an affair with fashion designer vanessa lander in the nineties . he married magazine editor carole annett , ten years his junior , last july . his friends say his ambition is to be president of the international olympic committee . lord coe plays it down but , like the canny politician he is , does not rule it out . if london 2012 goes well , his credentials will be as unbeatable as he was on the track .", "summary": " games chief attacks reality tv for encouraging young people to think it is better to be famous for nothing than be anonymous for doing something creative .   lord coe touches on possibility of former drugs cheat dwain chambers competing for gb at london 2012 .   the two-time 1500m champion is confident britain will hit games target of fourth in the medals table .   he laughs off bogus william hague gay rumours .
