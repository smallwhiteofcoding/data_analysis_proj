{"text": "under scrutiny : baroness warsi is to be investigated by the parliamentary watchdog . david cameron has referred baroness warsi to his independent adviser on ministerial interests over an official trip she made to pakistan with a business partner . it is the first time the prime minister has referred a minister to sir alex allan , who rules on whether politicians have broken the ministerial code . the move contrasts with mr cameron 's refusal to ask sir alex to investigate culture secretary jeremy hunt over his closeness to the murdoch media empire . baroness warsi yesterday issued a grovelling apology for failing to disclose her shared business interest with abid hussain , a relative . the beleaguered tory party co-chairman apologised for any ` embarrassment to the government ' . in response , the pm said : ` there are clearly some lessons for future handling and i have asked alex allan , my adviser on ministers ' interests , to consider the issues that have been raised . ' baroness warsi 's position is precarious because she is unpopular with some tory backbenchers , who want mr cameron to appoint an mp to the tory chairmanship to give the position more authority . downing street , however , is understood to rate the minister and is keen to keep her in the cabinet . one rumour is that she could be given the job of international development secretary , in charge of britain 's aid programme , in a reshuffle later this year . pressure : david cameron is being attacked by labout for referring baroness warsi to sir alex allen but not jeremy hunt . however , if sir alex rules against her , it could spell the end for her ministerial career . the referral relates to an undeclared relationship with mr hussain , who accompanied her to pakistan in july 2010 and assisted the british high commission with outreach events there . she said mr hussain was her husband 's second cousin and this fact was ` widely known ' . but she added that she did not realise the need to declare they had ` a common business interest as minority shareholders in a small food company ' . labour 's michael dugher , shadow cabinet office minister , said : ` baroness warsi clearly has very serious questions to answer . ` but david cameron 's actions in this case draw into sharp relief his refusal to hold a similar investigation into jeremy hunt , despite clear evidence that he broke the ministerial code by misleading the house of commons on at least three occasions .
