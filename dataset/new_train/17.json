{"text": "death toll reaches 37 after city battered a devastating rainstorm that claimed 37 lives in beijing over the weekend has raised serious concerns over the chinese capital 's ability to cope with flooding . beijing was hit with the heaviest downpour seen in the city in 60 years on saturday , with many roads submerged under waist-deep water for hours . the death toll had reached 37 by sunday night according to the municipal government , after 25 people drowned , six were killed in cave-ins in houses , five were electrocuted and one was killed by lightening . deluge : non-stop rain saw roads turned into rivers in the city , with parts submerged in up to 17 feet of water . chaos : cars can be seen floating in floodwaters surrounding a residential building in beijing , following fierce rainstorms over the weekend . record rainfall : two men watch as emergency services try to retrieve a damaged bus left submerged in a flooded car park after storms hit beijing at the weekend , leaving 37 people dead . disaster : cars remain partially submerged in rainwater in the aftermath of heavy storms that hit beijing , china at the weekend . the rain and flooding caused blackouts and road closures across the city . the beijing-hong kong-macau expressway was still yet to reopen on monday as part of it remained submerged . the disaster affected 1.9 million people and caused almost 10 billion yuan -lrb- almost # 1 billion -rrb- of damages , according to state news agency xinhua . the exact economic loss is still being verified by local governmental departments , according to beijing flood control and drought relief headquarters . government officials faced criticism as local people took to the internet to criticise the city 's inadequate drainage systems . ` the situation of the sewers reflects the real quality of the city 's infrastructure , ' one user called brother zhang xiaohua posted on popular micro-blogging site sina weibo . another going by the name of ` musibo ' wrote : ` china has been investing heavily in construction in recent years , and the glossy appearance of the cities is eye-catching . ` however , the huge loss from the rainstorm in beijing has exposed the flaws of the city 's infrastructure , which should raise an alarm for the policy makers . ' wreckage : flash floods receded to reveal cars left piled up in a ditch in fangshan district in beijing at the weekend . devastation : the rain and flooding in beijing is estimated to have caused around one billion pounds worth of damages . swept away : a vehicle washed away by flooding in fangshan district in beijing can be glimpsed still partially submerged in the muddy rainwater . bereft : a beijing family try and salvage their belongings from their damaged home after a storm wreaked havoc in the city at the weekend . scenes such as those witnessed in beijing across the weekend are becoming an all too familiar sight in china this summer , with rainstorms and flooding wreaking havoc in cities including shanghai , guangzhou , chongquing and shenzhen . experts believe the floods are largely down to urbanisation , with vast networks of roads and the elimination of greenbelts reducing some cities ' ability to cope with heavy rainfall . wang hao , from the china institute of water resources and hydropower research , said more than 80 per cent of beijing 's roads are covered in impermeable materials like concrete and asphalt - which prevent the infiltration of rain water . but an investigation led by li haiyan , a professor at the beijing university of civil engineering and architecture , about half of the city 's drainage networks are filled with sediments - with some layers as thick as ten to 15 per cent of the pipes ' diameter . urban flooding : china 's flooding problems are not limited to beijing - this picture shows waterlogged streets in gaogiao township in dongxing district in neijiang , in southwest china 's sichuan province at the weekend . submerged : this picture taken in chongqing in southwest china over the weekend shows people wading along a flooded street . sheng minzhi , an engineer at the hangzhou planning bureau , said the mass construction of tall buildings and underground parking lots in some chinese cities had also slowed the rate at which rainwater is absorbed into the ground . wang yi , from beijing 's flood control and drought relief headquarters , said the drainage systems in the city 's downtown area are for the most part build to withstand rainfall of between 36 and 45 millimetres per hour . only a few places , such as tiananmen square , have a more robust system that can withstand 56 millimetres of rainfall per hour . wang zhansheng , an environmental and engineering professor at tsinghua university , said the flooding would not be so severe if drainage systems were designed to handle more severe rainfalls , adding that the flooding could be avoided if regulations governing urban drainage took population growth , water usage and sewage treatment into consideration . xu chenghua , an engineer at the hangzhou urban planning academy , said storm drainage systems are supposed to be designed in accordance with the urban drainage engineering planning regulations approved by the ministry of housing and urban-rural development in 2000 . a central government group responsible for drafting regulations related to urban drainage engineering gathered on may 18 to discuss the problem of urban flooding . new regulations are expected to be launched next year , according to a source with the group . but experts have pointed out that the reconstruction of the drainage systems would be a very expensive and difficult undertaking . since the lay-out and the functional structure of the cities are already in shape , renewing the drainage systems to bring them up to the level of developed countries would be hugely costly , according to wang hao at the china institute of water resources and hydropower research . experts have urged the government to launch a uniform urban flooding drainage standard to guide the urban planning of chinese cities , xinhua said .", "summary": " death toll reaches 37 after city battered by heaviest downpour in 60 years .   disaster has affected 1.9 million and is estimated to have caused almost one billion pounds worth of damages .   the torrential rain saw roads submerged and caused blackouts across beijing .   residents took to the internet to express their anger over the city 's ` flawed ' infrastructure .
