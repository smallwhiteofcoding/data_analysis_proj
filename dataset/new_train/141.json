{"text": "many keep it as a precious memento of the best day of their lives . some hold on to it to pass on to a daughter or niece . others even wear it to renew their vows . pauline prescott 's wedding dress , on the other hand , ended up on the tip . the wife of the former deputy prime minister revealed that she was forced to dump the treasured gown after her husband grew tired of lugging it around during house moves . scroll down to watch the hilarious highlights ! confessions : former deputy prime minister lord prescott and his wife pauline gave a glimpse into their marital life in an appearance on all star mr and mrs . and although it is almost five decades since the dress became landfill , it seems a touch of resentment remains , with lady prescott , 73 , saying : ` john has never kept his wedding suit . i wish he had so i could throw it on the tip . ' the couple made the confession -- and a few others -- to television presenter phillip schofield when they appeared on his show all star mr and mrs last night . lord prescott said he regretted disposing of the dress and had not realised its value at the time . the 74-year-old explained : ` when we got married she bought a wedding dress but she never told me how much it cost . at the time she told me she would turn it into a cocktail dress but she never did . ` we also had this big box and we used to carry it from house to house . one day i said let 's get rid of it . she was pregnant at the time . so we went down to the corporation tip and we dumped it . ` she never told me how much the wedding dress was but she has been going to those boutiques for years ' . ` mystery and surprise ' : lord prescott , left , and his wife , right , each donned headphones during parts of the show so they could n't hear what the other was saying . the couple also admitted that another source of conflict between them is the kitchen . lord prescott said : ` pauline wishes i had two offices so i would not use her kitchen as an office . she always complains about that . ` there was a time when tony blair rang up and she was banging the pots and pans in the kitchen and i said  listen love , can you shut up , i am talking to tony  and she said  this is my kitchen , not your office . and who is tony ?  ` tony blair then came on the phone and said :  i heard that .  ` i was trying to get tony and gordon to agree and there she was banging the plates . it was a crucial moment . she deliberately goes around banging plates so you ca n't hear the phone . ' however , while the couple were quick to confess their more amusing marital conflicts in front of a studio audience on the itv show , there was one bump in the road that did not get a mention . in 2006 , it emerged that lord prescott had carried out an affair with his glamorous secretary tracey temple , a divorcee 24 years his junior . the two-year fling began at an office christmas party in 2002 after months of flirtation . the pair continued secret trysts at the politician 's grace-and-favour flat in whitehall and at dorneywood , his 215-acre country retreat in buckinghamshire , until 2004 . last year , lord prescott said : ` it was stupid . i 've got no excuse really . people talk about mid-life crisis but i think it was part of an opportunity that developed . ' though they have stayed together , in an interview last year lady prescott admitted she would never forgive her husband . the couple married in chester in 1961 when lord prescott , 23 , was a ship steward , and 22-year-old lady prescott worked as a hairdresser . on last night 's programme , the labour stalwart paid tribute to his wife , saying : ` i could not have been successful without her . she always pinches the tv remote off me though . it 's 50 years and there is still mystery and surprise so long may that continue . ' in the show , one half of the couple is asked questions about their partner , while the other is taken to a separate booth , blindfolded and fitted with headphones to stop them hearing the answers . when they return , they are asked the same questions -- and have to give the same answer to score points and win money for charity .", "summary": " the former deputy prime minister admitted bringing his wife 's wedding gown to the tip during an appearance on all star mr and mrs .   lord prescott said their relationship still had ` mystery and surprise ' after 50 years of marriage .
