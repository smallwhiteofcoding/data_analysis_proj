{"text": "he is not the first politician to attempt to ` look cool , ' when listening to music and he definitely wo n't be the last . but george osborne has become an unlikely internet hit after a youtube user flagged up his embarrassing attempt to bob his head along to a rock band . the chancellor was a guest on the andrew marr show when the presenter introduced british band keane at the end of the programme . scroll down for video . nonplussed : george osborne was a guest on the andrew marr show . as keane start to play their single , the camera panned to the guests and mr osborne looked disinterested . spotted : when the politician realises the camera is focused on him , he completely changes his body language . he looks straight at the camera before looking back at the band and bobbing his head in time to the music . musical appreciation : george osborne has now been mocked for ` attempts to look cool ' as he listens to keane . but mr osborne is not the only politician to look awkward on the sofa when being played to by musicians on the show . nick clegg is seen engaging in some finger tapping when brit award winner emeli sandi performed weeks earlier . in contrast prime minister david cameron is a lot more reserved in his appreciation of the live music as his reaction to singer pj harvey shows in a clip from years earlier . however the funniest video is of the corrigan brothers performing their political song ` there 's no-one as irish as barack obama ' in 2008 . in the clip , william hague , who was shadow foreign secretary at the time , and the then deputy leader of the liberal democrats , vince cable , are in stitches on the sofa over the song . in the past politicians have been left with egg on their face over their public declarations of their favourite music . in 2010 , david cameron was blasted by the smiths ' guitarist johnny marr for saying he liked the band . marr took to twitter and said : ` david cameron stop saying that you like the smiths . no you do n't . i forbid you to like it . ' similarly former prime minister gordon brown was left embarrassed when he claimed to be a fan of rock band the arctic monkeys but admitted he could not name one of their songs . as the band start to play their single , silenced by the night , the camera panned to the guests . originally there is no reaction from mr osborne who stared at the group looking nonplussed as these pictures show . but when the politician realises the camera is focused on him , he completely changes his body language . in cringe-worthy fashion the tory mp looks straight at the camera before looking back at the band and bobbing his head in time to the music . the hilarious attempt to look interested has been mocked on youtube in a video titled ` the art of politics no. 1 : george osborne . ' in a humorous text commentary that accompanies the clip , it reads : ` the andrew marr show loves to sign off with a bit of music . in this case keane , led by their uncanny david cameron lookalike . ` as the band performs , the show 's other guests watch from the sofa . ` one of this week 's guests was george osborne . what did george think ? not a rave review . ` but watch his reaction when he realises the camera 's on him . great recovery . ' the video has already had more than 1,200 hits and provoked some funny comments online . one wrote : ` the weeping angel of crowd-pleasing . ' another person said ' i have watched this 3 times and shared it on facebook ... i do n't know why this has tickled me so much !! ' favourite of the chancellor : keane playing their new single silenced by the night , in the andrew marr studio . tv show : andrew marr left , introduced keane , including lead singer tom chaplin , right .", "summary": " as keane start to play , osborne looks nonplussed - but when he realises the camera is on him , he starts bobbing his head in time to the music .
