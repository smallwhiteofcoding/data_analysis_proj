{"text": "people with parkinson 's disease suffer a decline in their quality of life years before they are diagnosed , it is claimed . scientists have documented declines in physical and mental health , pain , and emotional health beginning several years before the onset of the disease . and the decline then continues at a rate of five to seven times faster than the average yearly decline caused by normal ageing in people without the disease , according to researchers from the harvard school of public health . parkinson 's sufferer muhammad ali . a study has revealed that a decline in quality of life starts years before the disease is diagnosed . lead researcher dr natalia palacios said : ` we observed a decline in physical . function in parkinson 's patients relative to their healthy counterparts . beginning three years prior to diagnosis in men and 7.5 years prior to diagnosis in women . ` the . decline continues at a rate that is five to seven times faster than the . average yearly decline caused by normal ageing in individuals without . the disease . ` this . result provides support to the notion that the pathological process . leading to parkinson 's disease may start several years before a . diagnosis . ' the study is the first to examine patterns in the quality of life of parkinson 's patients prior to diagnosis and is published in the journal of parkinson 's disease . the researchers studied 51,350 male health professionals enrolled in the health professionals follow up study -lrb- hpfs -rrb- and 121,701 female registered nurses enrolled in the nurses ' health study -lrb- nhs -rrb- . in both studies , participants filled out biannual questionnaires that documented the occurrence of major chronic disease by answering questions about a variety of lifestyle characteristics . the nurses study measured health-related quality of life in physical functioning ; role limitations due to physical problems ; role limitations due to emotional problems ; vitality ; bodily pain ; social functioning ; mental health ; and general health perceptions . by contrast , the hpfs questionnaire only assessed physical functioning . of the 454 men and 414 women identified with parkinson 's , the researchers found that a decline began about three years before diagnosis for men and 7.5 years for women . results also showed other measures of quality of life - available only in women - declined in a similar pattern . the scientists point out that their study is bolstered by the available data on both parkinson 's patients and a healthy group used for comparison . dr palacios said : ` our hope is that , with future research , biological markers of the disease process may be recognizable in this pre-clinical phase . '", "summary": " scientists observe decline in physical function in parkinson 's patients three years prior to diagnosis in men and 7.5 years prior to diagnosis in women . "}
