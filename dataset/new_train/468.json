{"text": "taking sugary snacks off supermarket checkouts could help combat child obesity , a leading scientist has suggested . lord krebs said the rise in the number of people who are overweight and obese in recent years was ` staggering ' and required tougher intervention than just encouraging healthy eating . the incoming president of the british science association president and former chair of the food standards agency said having an array of sweet treats at children 's eye-level at supermarket checkouts was ` totally inappropriate ' . changes : taking sugary snacks off supermarket checkouts could help combat child obesity , a leading scientist has suggested . the peer said soft policy ` nudges ' would not solve the obesity crisis alone , and called for tougher restrictions on food marketing and advertising . he praised a recent move in australia to only sell cigarettes in plain packaging and proposals to sell them only under the counter , saying smoking and obesity required tough regulation . ` in the case of obesity -lsb- we need -rsb- more regulation of the food industry to prevent them in their quest , in which they are immensely successful , of distilling fat , salt and sugar into perfect little gems we are all happy to eat ' , he told the british science festival in aberdeen . ` they are very good at promoting it particularly to children . when i was shopping at marks & spencer in the centre of oxford i was completely struck by , at this level above the ground , all the little kiddies ' sweeties lined up there . rise : lord krebs said the rise in the number of people who are overweight and obese in recent years was ` staggering ' ` it 's clearly totally inappropriate for businesses to be able to do that . it 's directly marketing to three year old kids things that they should n't be encouraged to eat large quantities of . ' in a speech today he will say there is ` no magic bullet ' for tackling obesity , but scientists were generally agreed that while exercise is important , reducing calorie intake is the best way to lose weight . low level intervention such as information about healthy eating ; and what he called middle-rung measures including publishing salt and fat content on packets would not be enough , he said . one government initiative known as the great swapathon involved encouraging people to buy healthier products such as fruit and vegetables with supermarket discount vouchers . however he said there was evidence that families simply used the money they saved to buy more unhealthy food . he said : ` the swapathon is part of the government 's wider initiative of inviting the food industry to help to tackle obesity on a voluntary basis . ` the problem with this , as a food industry director said to the select committee , ` any business is in business to make money and opportunities to influence behaviour will be taken if they are a means to selling more products ' . ' the government has set up a behavioural insights team - also known as the ` nudge unit ' - to find ways of discreetly altering human behaviour by persuasion such as paying fines on time . but lord krebs that this kind of policy was not strong enough to address major problems such as obesity or unsustainable consumption which required ` a shove rather than a nudge ' . during his chairmanship of the food standards agency , krebs criticised the organic food movement , saying that people buying such food were ` not getting value for money . ' yesterday he said the rate of overweight and obese children had doubled in two decades , with major implications for health which would put a huge burden on the healthcare system . he said : ` it is easy to describe the cause of obesity . we live in an environment in which delicious , affordable calories are more readily available and in which our lifestyles have become more sedentary than ever before in our evolutionary history , and our body 's inbuilt regulatory mechanisms are simply not equipped to cope . ` it is much less easy to see how whole populations , not just in this country , but all over the globe , can be persuaded to change their behavior by eating less and/or exercising more ... the central challenge is to find ways of getting populations as a whole to change their behaviour . `", "summary": " lord krebs said having an array of sweet treats at children 's eye-level at supermarket checkouts was ` totally inappropriate ' "}
