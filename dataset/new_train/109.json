' but he did concede : ` they 've got better . ' classic drama : morse was one of the most popular tv series in british history . dexter 's first morse novel was published in 1975 , and in 1987 itv began adapting the books for the hit drama , starring the late john thaw as chief inspector morse with whately as the then sergeant lewis . it ended in 2000 after 33 episodes . its successor , lewis , has become one of itv1 's most consistent performers in recent years , often pulling in audiences of more than seven million . it also stars laurence fox as detective sergeant james hathaway , lewis 's sidekick . earlier this year the morse brand was extended further with a one-off prequel , endeavour , which was a ratings success . dexter said : ` one reason endeavour did well is because everyone could understand it . people said to me ,  brilliant . typical dexter  . well , i did n't write it . i wish i had . the agreement is they wo n't put anything on telly without me seeing it . sometimes we have to say it 's not up to scratch . ' dexter , who gave up alcohol because of ` over-consumption ' , said he is often asked why he killed off morse . he explained that the character 's death would have been inevitable because of his unhealthy lifestyle and famous fondness for whisky . partners in solving crime : inspector morse and his partner sergeant lewis . the novelist added : ` i was asked if i thought of an epitaph for him -lsb- morse -rsb- , and remembered  under this sod lies another  . ' he told how everyone praised him , telling him what a ` clever chap ' he was , when really he had taken the quote from spike milligan . whately has also recently hinted that the drama might not last much longer . ` i 'm now police retirement age this year , so the time is coming quite soon , i think , ' he said . around 13million viewers tuned in to watch the last episode of morse in 2000 , and there was a huge outpouring of sadness for the detective 's demise . but lewis fans can take some solace . following its success earlier in the year , a full series of endeavour , starring shaun evans as the young morse , has now been commissioned . evans won over critics and viewers alike with his portrayal of the young detective . ratings for the one-off film , which was broadcast in january to mark the 25th anniversary of the very first episode of morse , were 8.2 million .", "summary": " colin dexter predicts next series of lewis will be last .   believes the show has become ` ridiculously complex ' "}
