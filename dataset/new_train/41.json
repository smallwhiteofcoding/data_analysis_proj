{"text": "police , neighbors and friends struggled to unravel the mysterious deaths of a nebraska woman and her 10-year-old son that began with them appearing to go on an excursion and ended with their bodies found deep in the woods of an iowa state park . charlotte schilling , 41 , of plattsmouth , nebraska , and her son , owen , had been missing since may 10 , when the mother checked the boy out of his elementary school . it was not unusual for the stay-at-home mother-of-three to surprise her children with short road trips to parks , zoos and other nearby attractions , relatives said . but the schilling always called home and the excursions never lasted long . her family grew worried when neither she nor owen returned home , and her cellphone went unanswered . gone : charlotte schilling , 41 , checked her son owen , 10 , out of his elementary school on may 10 to go camping and had not been heard from since . charlotte 's daughter , lindsay schilling , 20 , said that is when she became concerned . ' i called until her phone died - every minute , ' she told ketv.com . ` the fact that she did n't pick up mine - that 's when it hit me : there 's something wrong right now . ' ` none of this makes sense , ' said polly best , who lives next door to the schillings . ` it 's just tragic . there was never a hint of anything wrong there . ' best stood outside the family 's home on tuesday holding a roast she had cooked for relatives gathered inside . yellow police tape blocked the schillings ' driveway and front steps from reporters trying to talk to family members and neighbors wanting to offer condolences . surveillance video from a convenience store in the area where the woman and boy 's bodies were found sunday showed owen hugging his mom and schilling kissing her son on the head . ketv in omaha aired the store video footage . ' i just ca n't believe it , ' best said . ` that did not look to me like a woman who would hurt her child . ' but that appears to be what investigators believe may have happened . mystery : police have not ruled out the possibility of a murder-suicide in the deaths of charlotte schilling , left , and her son owen , right . police in council bluffs , iowa , said on tuesday they ` do not suspect any outside foul play ' in the deaths of schilling and her son . their bodies were found on sunday evening in lake manawa state park , south of council bluffs in western iowa , about 20 miles north of plattsmouth . authorities investigating the deaths added they are not looking for an ` outside ' killer or at-large suspect . asked whether that means police believe mrs schilling killed her son and then herself , police sgt. dave dawson replied : ' i ca n't say at this point . ' dawson told the omaha world-herald that police are convinced ' a murderer is not on the loose , ' adding that the mother and son were not victims of an attacker . investigators stopped short of labeling the case a murder-suicide , saying they must wait for further autopsy results before determining the cause of death . council bluffs sgt. dave dawson said he expected to announce the cause of death by the end of the week . investigators are leaning toward the belief that the bodies had been in the spot where they were found since may 10 , the day that schilling checked owen out of wade robin elementary school in bellevue , nebraska , and they went missing . happy : carl schilling , left , with his wife charlotte schilling , centre , and their son owen , right , in a family photo posted on facebook in 2010 . the day after they disappeared , police found schilling 's vehicle at the same park where the pair would eventually be found dead . schilling 's cellphone and wallet were in her car . nine days after the discovery of the vehicle , a passer-by found the woman and boy 's bodies in thick woods about a half-mile from where the car had been parked . authorities had to rely on autopsy results to confirm the identities because the bodies had decomposed . ' i just about went to my knees , ' said the family 's neighbor , naomi raposo , 50 , describing her reaction to news of the deaths . she just found out tuesday , not realizing that earlier reports of bodies being found were about schilling and her son . ` they 've been very peaceful neighbors . they 're very friendly , ' raposo said . the night before the woman and boy went missing , another neighbor , athena meneses , said she spoke to schilling at a local cub scout meeting , where meneses had taken her own son and owen . owen had wanted to join the group , meneses said . ' i did n't really know her very well , but she seemed upset . she had a bump on her head ,  meneses said of schilling .  she did n't seem like she was really happy that night . she said she was n't feeling well and that she 'd like to go home . she told me that she had fallen down earlier that day . ' sunday night a passerby saw two decomposed bodies found at lake manawa state park . after an autopsy officials confirmed on tuesday that they were the mother and son . the night before she disappeared charlotte told a neighbor she did n't feel well and had fallen and bumped her head . but her husband said nothing was out of the ordinary . meneses and her family moved to plattsmouth about two years ago , just blocks from the schillings . she said owen was a playmate to her four oldest children , ages 6 to 14 . ` we had a trampoline , and he would come over almost every day to play on that , ' she said . owen was closest to her eight-year-old son , christian . ' i think my son said it best : he was energy-filled , and a very happy little boy , ' meneses said . school officials said students were having difficulty coping with the fifth-grader 's death . tuesday was the last day of school before summer break . ` there 's a lot of sadness and a lot of confusion , ' said bellevue public schools superintendent frank harwood . cody johnson , a clerk at the lake manawa convenience store where surveillance video captured schilling and her son shortly after she checked him out of school , was one of the last people to see them alive . schilling bought a pack of cigarettes for herself , and apple juice and snacks for owen . ` the kid came in all hyper , like a normal kid would be , and went around looking at stuff , ' johnson said . ` nothing seemed out of the ordinary . they were just like any other mom and son . there was nothing that showed me anything bad was going to happen . ' investigators have been treating the case as if the boy had been kidnapped , but they had said they did n't believe he was in danger .", "summary": " investigators are not looking for an outside killer or at-large suspect .   police said charlotte schilling , 41 , and her son owen , 10 , were not attacked .
