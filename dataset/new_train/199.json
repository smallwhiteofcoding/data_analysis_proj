{"text": "a toddler cheated death in a medical miracle thanks to a combination of two killers conditions , it has emerged . while one defect threatened the life of conner breslin , another dangerous condition neutralised the effects of the first . both rare heart conditions are extremely dangerous , but - in a million-to-one chance - because he had both , it saved his life . on the mend : conner breslin with his mother claire mccormack . but the youngster almost died when he developed two dangerous heart conditions . conner pictured immediately after his heart surgery at the age of six months . the youngster was only saved after he developed two holes in his heart . reversed arteries in the little boy 's heart were flooding his lungs with blood and depriving the rest of his body of oxygen , meaning he was in danger of drowning . however , conner had developed two holes in his heart , which allowed just enough oxygenated blood to escape for him to survive . the 15-month-old , who has ` complex transposition of the great vessels -lrb- tgv -rrb- ' , has now beaten the odds and is back at home . the youngster even took his first steps last month - a day his parents never thought they would see . his proud mother , 26-year-old claire mccormack said : ` normally holes in your heart would be a terrible diagnosis , but it 's amazing to think that it 's that very thing that saved him . ` if the holes had not been there the other defect would have killed him . ' i have been told the odds of him having both the conditions are very slim and a good job he did . ` he 's a little miracle . to look at him now you would have no idea . he 's bounced back incredibly well . ' reversed arteries in the little boy 's heart were flooding his lungs with blood and depriving the rest of his body of oxygen , meaning he was in danger of drowning . fighter : conner underwent a gruelling eight-hour operation to widen the holes in his heart to allow more blood through . conner was born a normal happy baby with no complications in june last year . claire and his dad shaun breslin , 26 , took him home to north lanarkshire , scotland , but when he was five weeks old the he stopped eating . he was admitted to glasgow 's yorkhill royal hospital for sick children with a suspected viral infection , but was rushed into intensive care just two hours later , after being diagnosed with tgv . the young boy was suffering from reversed arteries , which instead of pumping blood from his heart into his body , were directing it into his lungs , causing them to fill with blood . in july last year , conner underwent a gruelling eight-hour operation to widen the holes and allow more blood through . since then , the little lad has had open-heart surgery twice more , including a 12-hour procedure in february , where surgeons switched his reversed arteries and closed the holes in his tiny heart . claire added : ` the idea of the first operation to widen the holes was to allow as much oxygenated blood to get into his body through the holes as possible , so he was as strong as he could be for his big operation to fix the defects . relieved : conner 's parents claire and shaun breslin say their boy has made a miraculous recovery and even took his first steps last month . ' i was a nervous wreck throughout all his surgery . it does n't matter how strong you think you are , watching your child be put to sleep for an operation is the worst experience in the world . i remember just breaking down and crying . ` during the big operation he went into surgery at 8.30 am and did n't come out until 9pm . ` after the operation he was so swollen i did n't even recognise him . the only thing that identified him as my child was the birth mark on his calf . there were so many tubes it was like spaghetti junction . ` he 's such a fighter . the doctors said they gave him enough medicine to sedate a donkey for three days but after just one he started kicking . they just could n't get him to sleep . ` he became quite well known on the ward for his night time noise . from that the nurses said they knew he was going to be fine . ' conner was expected to stay in hospital for over two months to recover , but just a week and a half later he was ready to leave , to the amazement of nurses on the ward . he has since made a miraculous recovery and took his first steps last month . claire said : ` we are not religious at all but i believe he is a miracle . to go from being told he may not make it through the night to taking his first steps is amazing . ` he might be a little smaller than other children as he 's growing up but other than that he 's completely normal . ` and by the way he screams there is definitely nothing wrong with his lungs .
