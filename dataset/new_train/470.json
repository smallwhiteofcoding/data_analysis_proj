{"text": "towns and villages that oppose the building of wind-farms will be ` bribed ' into accepting them with an offer of lower energy bills , the energy secretary has said . ed davey is trying to diffuse a groundswell of local opposition to the building of wind farms in the countryside . he announced yesterday that communities that accept the building of wind-farms nearby will be rewarded with lower energy bills or amenities like children 's playgrounds . wind farm developers could contribute to ` community funds ' to help placate angry campaigners . but campaigners accused him of using ` bribes ' to throw the planning process and split communities . there are currently 3,350 onshore wind turbines , and his department will have to build around 10,000 more by 2020 to meet green targets . the move will draw battlelines with the 105 tory mps , who wrote to david cameron earlier this year calling for a halt to the march of unsightly and ` inefficient ' turbines , and cuts to the subsidies paid to developers . in a call for evidence , mr davey suggests giving communities money off their bills , or grants for local amenities such as playgrounds , environmental projects , sports facilities or tourist attractions . some wind farm developers , mainly in scotland , already contribute to ` community funds . ' it is now suggested this could become common practice in a bid to tackle angry campaigners . the idea was proposed earlier this year by tim yeo , chairman of the energy and climate change committee who said : ` we do have to work harder to find places where wind turbines are acceptable and be more creative about sharing the benefits with locals . frankly , we need to bribe them . ' campaigners accused energy secretary ed davey of proposing ` bribes ' to split communities over wind farms . tom leveridge of the campaign to protect rural england said : ` this would fundamentally undermine a core principle of the planning system -- that planning permission should not be bought or sold - and put the countryside at greater risk from poorly sited wind developments . ` a genuine attempt to promote community engagement in the design , location and layout of wind farms should lead to a more sensitive approach to reducing the impact wind turbines can have on our beautiful landscapes . ' there are more than 300 groups actively opposing applications and the government is concerned that less than half of applications are currently being granted by councils . steve hey , chairman of the campaign group no to wold wind farms , which is fighting several turbine applications in east yorkshire , said : ` this already happens . developers bribe people who are not directly affected to back it -- pitching neighbour against neighbour and village against village . ` people who have turbines right next to their house , and have their house price reduced by # 20,000 will not benefit any more than the next village where people might not be affected at all . ` i ca n't believe this government is planning to use money to influence the planning process , it should be about the benefits and costs of the development . you can not buy the english countryside and this will divide communities . i think it 's disgraceful . ' mr davey recently won a battle with george osborne to cut wind subsidies by just 10 per cent , not the 25 per cent the chancellor was pushing for . he said : ` onshore wind has an important role to play in a diverse energy mix that is secure , low carbon and affordable . we know that two thirds of people support the growth of onshore wind . ` but far too often , host communities have seen the wind farms but not the windfall . we are sensitive to the controversy around onshore wind and we want to ensure that people benefit from having wind farms sited next to them . ' he cites a scheme near burnfoot hill wind farm in devon where a community fund of # 2.26 million was put into community projects and another near suide wind farm in argyll , scotland which raises # 28,500 a year . maf smith , deputy chief executive of renewableuk said the wind industry employs 8.600 people and is worth # 500million to the economy and should ` ensure local people share fully in the economic benefits . ' he said : ` thousands of people around the uk are already seeing evidence of this -- wind farm owners donate at least # 1,000 for every megawatt we install , to be spent on community projects like improving sports facilities , village halls and school libraries .
