{"text": "prince andrew 's bid to save the duke of wellington 's battalion from defence cuts received a boost last night after reports that the army chief behind the move plans to discuss the issue with him . well-placed sources said major general graham binns , regimental colonel of the yorkshire regiment , was ready to reconsider his decision to cut the army 's link with the victor of the battle of waterloo . the 600-strong duke of wellington 's battalion , formally known as 3rd battalion , the yorkshire regiment , will be one of the most high-profile victims of the army cuts to be announced this week . boost : british soldiers take positions during clashes with gunmen in basra , iraq , in 2004 . there are signs that the duke of wellington 's battalion could be saved from defence cuts . the regiment is to be reduced to two battalions , but the duke of york , who is colonel-in-chief of the duke of wellington 's battalion , currently serving in afghanistan , is known to support moves to retain its historic name . prince andrew last week spoke of his ` passionate care ' for the soldiers in the battalion , prompting hopes of a u-turn . he also dined with officers of the yorkshire regiment last week . former officers in the duke of wellington 's battalion were shocked to hear maj gen binns announce two months ago that when the regiment was cut from two to three , the wellington 's name would disappear . following a mini-mutiny , it is understood that he is considering a number of ways of retaining the name of the man who defeated napoleon . one proposal is to name the two remaining yorkshire regiment battalions , the duke of york 's and the duke of wellington 's . another is to call one of the 200-strong regimental companies the duke of wellington 's . tradition : prince andrew -lrb- right -rrb- is known to support moves to retain the historic name , which retains the army 's link with the victor of the battle of waterloo -lrb- left -rrb- . a spokeswoman for prince andrew said he had not met maj gen binns last week , but declined to say if the two men had spoken . the army cuts , which will reduce its fighting strength to 82,000 , its lowest level since the napoleonic wars , is expected to see several other famous regimental names disappear including the argyll and sutherland highlanders , whose royal colonel is the queen ; the royal scots dragoon guards ; 3rd battalion , mercian regiment ; and 2nd battalion royal regiment of fusiliers . savings : defence secretary philip hammond is expected to claim that the cuts focus on regiments with the most foreign-born recruits . the cuts have been delayed for weeks amid squabbling over where they should fall . english mps claim that scots regiments have been spared for fear of antagonising public opinion in scotland ahead of the vote on independence . defence secretary philip hammond will claim that the reductions focus on regiments with the most foreign-born recruits , in particular regiments with a high number of commonwealth troops . however , critics say this does not square with his decision to exempt the gurkhas , who previously have been championed by actress joanna lumley . ` the scots , welsh and gurkhas have been spared the worst for political reasons , so the english regiments are in for a nasty shock , ' said a source . a ministry of defence spokesman said last night : ` the traditions and heritage of the regimental system are hugely respected . ` the defence secretary has been clear that the regimental system is fundamental to british army fighting power . ` we are not going to change that .
