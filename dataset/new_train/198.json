' scene : all three confrontations between mr malik and ms sarwar took place inside the store , in reading , berkshire . he added : ` amna was used to his language and body language . for her to feel so upset that she had to go to the police , we inferred that it was a serious conflict . ' a family feud spilled over into the pair 's working lives when the married father-of-two walked into the branch in july , last year , while he was meant to be on holiday . after an initial confrontation he left the store only to return later in an agitated state and he approached ms sarwar talking loudly and aggressively , the tribunal heard . however , the dispute reached its peak when he appeared inside the branch a third time several days later when she claims he threatened to ` chop her up ' . another witness , who mistook him for a customer , stated he had been aggressive and threatening . mr malik denies harassing ms sarwar and says his loud voice was simply an attempt to express himself as he struggled against his stutter . out of work : since his dismissal from asda , mr malik has been out of work and claiming job seeker 's allowance . he said : ` he dismissed me because i raised my voice , that is not under my control . ` when i talk with someone , in order to continue the conversation , i have to raise my voice because that helps me . ' i spent seven-and-a-half years with this company . people know me , all my colleagues understand i have to raise my voice . ` customers do n't know me . the customers think i 'm shouting . i 'm raising my voice but i 'm talking normally . ' mr malik appealed the sacking decision and produced a letter from his gp confirming he suffered from the long term problem and had attempted speech therapy to no avail . the tribunal panel was told that the father-of-two 's stutter got worse the more stressed he got and he sometimes gesticulated and moved his body as he struggled to speak . when he approached his cousin , who was working at a check-out till at the same branch , he said he was afflicted with the stutter and could not squeeze out the words he wanted to say . the store assistant began to gesticulate and his actions scared a nearby customer who , oblivious to his disability , told managers he was shouting and being aggressive , the tribunal heard . the store assistant claims that owing to a family feud his cousin turned on him , claiming he had threatened to ` chop her up ' - a claim completely absent from the customer 's complaint . since his dismissal mr malik has been out of work and claiming job seeker 's allowance . the hearing continues .", "summary": " adnan malik accused supermarket giant of discriminating against his disability .   mr malik was accused of string of escalating instances of bullying and harassment against cousin and colleague amna sarwar .   ms sarwar claims mr malik threatened to ` chop her up ' "}
