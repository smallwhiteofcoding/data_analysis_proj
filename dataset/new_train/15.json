{"text": "furious : local government minister bob neill -lrb- pictured -rrb- said the decision by some councils to give its councillors inflation-busting pay rises was ` completely unjustifiable ' hundreds of councillors awarded themselves inflation-busting rises in allowances last year . figures show that a dozen town halls did so despite the pay freeze for many local government workers . one council increased allowances by 28 per cent -- the first stage of an 85 per cent rise over three years . the hikes , which came even as local authorities made vocal protests about the impact of the government 's budget cuts , have been condemned by local government minister bob neill as ` completely unjustifiable ' . there have been repeated complaints that allowances -- which are paid automatically to all elected councillors and are not linked to the amount of work they do or meetings they attend -- have been overly generous . they cost taxpayers more than # 200million a year , with several town halls doubling their allowances over the past seven years . the latest national breakdown of increases has been published by the taxpayers ' alliance , which found 32 councils raised allowances between the financial year 2010/11 , the coalition 's first year in power , and 2011/12 . twelve raised them by more than 4 per cent -- the level of inflation at the start of the last financial year as taken from the consumer price index . they included boston borough council in lincolnshire , which gave its 32 elected members a 28 per cent increase to push the basic allowance paid to a councillor with no special responsibilities from # 2,378 a year to # 3,052 . a further increase to # 3,727 followed this spring , and next year there will be another rise to # 4,400 . this will amount to an 85 per cent hike since 2010 , pushing basic pay from # 46 to # 85 a week . peter bedford , leader of the council , argued that allowances for the authority ` lagged far behind all others in lincolnshire ' . inflation-buster : boston borough council -lrb- above -rrb- in lincolnshire gave its 32 elected members a 28 per cent increase . in slough , allowances went up by 19 per cent in the autumn of 2010 from # 5,973 to # 7,100 . ` it was the first time in seven years that the allowance was increased , ' a council spokesman said . ` our allowances were considerably lower than those in neighbouring boroughs . ' in fact , slough is bordered on three sides by south buckinghamshire district council , which pays its councillors a basic # 4,100 a year . of the 12 which raised allowances above inflation , five councils also increased council tax . the tpa pointed to major differences between the allowances in neighbouring authorities , and questioned why manchester pays # 16,000 while next door trafford pays less than # 6,500 . of large metropolitan authorities , birmingham pays # 16,267 -- almost # 10,000 more than trafford . tpa chief executive matthew sinclair said : ` with local authorities up and down the country having to rein in spending , councillors who have awarded themselves an increase in their allowances in defiance of government advice should hang their heads in shame . ` they can not retain the moral authority to make tough decisions on spending . ' mr neill said : ` most councils have frozen or cut councillor allowances to do their bit . ` however , a small minority have hiked them which is completely unjustifiable given rank-and-file workers in local government have faced a pay freeze . these councils should be held to account . '", "summary": " hikes come as local authorities complain about the impact of government cuts .   boston borough gave its members a 28 % increase .   mid devon 23 % and slough 19 % , new figures show .
