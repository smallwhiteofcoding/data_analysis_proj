{"text": "updated : . 08:26 est , 30 december 2011 . one in ten under-25s think elvis presley or paul mccartney wrote the words instead of robert burns , pictured . it happens every year . we get 12 months to learn the lyrics -- but hardly anyone bothers . now three-quarters admit they will mime or make up the words when the clock strikes midnight tomorrow . . . and the time comes for auld lang syne . a poll found that some 37 per cent do not know a single line of robert burns 's piece , written in 1788 . its provenance is equally mysterious to some , especially when it comes to the younger revellers . one in ten under-25s think elvis presley or paul mccartney wrote the words -- whatever they may be . in terms of tactics , 37 per cent of all those surveyed said they hum loudly when their musical knowledge lets them down . others prefer a more physical performance : a fifth attempt to prevent people from discovering their ignorance by distracting them with some vigorous arm-shaking while linking limbs during the seasonal sing-song . almost two-thirds were also stumped over the meaning of the song 's title , which roughly translates as ` times gone by ' . now three-quarters of respondents to a poll admitted they will mime or make up the words when the time comes to sing auld lang syne on new year 's eve . the survey , to mark the release of warner bros ' ensemble comedy new year 's eve , found 10 per cent typically gaze upwards through the duration of the song to avoid being detected . a cowardly 5 per cent actually leave the room altogether . rather fittingly , the most commonly misremembered lyric was : ` should auld acquaintance be forgot , and never brought to mind ? ' some scamps replace the line with : ` should old acquaintance be forgot , and something else that rhymes . ' in total , 2,105 adults responded to the poll commissioned to promote the hollywood film , which features a string of stars including halle berry , michelle pfeiffer , zac efron and sarah jessica parker . meanwhile , many people 's celebrations are being adapted to deal with their financial worries , a survey has found . more people are planning a big night in than the traditional big night out this new year 's eve , with many revellers staying indoors due to concerns about cash . but this does not actualyl make for a cheaper evening , according to the post office home insurance new year survey . nearly three quarters of people -lrb- 74 per cent -rrb- will stay in this year , it found , up from 72 per cent who were planning to stay in last year and 55 per cent in 2007 . money and cost are an important factor in deciding how to see in the new year , with 14 per cent of people citing this as the main reason behind their plans . but those choosing to party at home are set to spend an average of # 95 on food and alcohol - amounting to double the # 48 average spend for those planning on heading out to celebrate . post office head of home insurance , gerry barrett , said : ` new year 's eve can end up being a costly night , and as our research shows bizarrely , it can be even more costly for those who plan to stay in . ' mr barrett said the survey of 2,016 uk adults showed people look set to be emulating diners in channel 4 programme come dine with me . he said : ` come dine with me fever is apparently gripping the nation as more people than ever plan to stay at home or hold dinner parties , but many hosts could see their bills mount up as they look to impress their friends . ' while the lyrics for auld lang syne are attributed to robert burns , it is likely that he merely adapted the words of an old ballad . burns apparently sent a copy of the song to the scots musical museum with the remark : ` the following song , an old song , of the olden times , and which has never been in print , nor even in manuscript until i took it down from an old man . ' the poet also wrote a letter to mrs agnes dunlop , attaching his version of auld lang syne , in which he comments : ` light be the turf on breast of the heaven-inspired poet who composed this glorious fragment ! there is more of the fire of native genius in it than in half a dozen of modern english bacchanalians . ' some say the famous chorus actually dates from the middle of the 16th century , if not before . the phrase ` auld lang syne ' is also used in similar poems by robert ayton -lrb- 1570 -- 1638 -rrb- , allan ramsay -lrb- 1686 -- 1757 -rrb- , and james watson -lrb- 1711 -rrb- as well as older folk songs predating burns . contemporary scottish poet matthew fitt uses the phrase ` in the days of auld lang syne ' as the equivalent of ` once upon a time ... ' in his retelling of fairy tales . but for those who need to brush up for the big night ... should auld acquaintance be forgot , and never brought to mind ? should auld acquaintance be forgot , and auld lang syne ! chorus . for auld lang syne , my dear , for auld lang syne . we 'll tak a cup o ' kindness yet , for auld lang syne . and to really impress here are verses two to five ... and surely ye 'll be your pint stowp!and surely i 'll be mine!and we 'll tak a cup o'kindness yet , for auld lang syne.we twa hae run about the braes , and pou 'd the gowans fine ; but we 've wander 'd mony a weary fit , sin ' auld lang syne.we twa hae paidl 'd in the burn , frae morning sun till dine ; but seas between us braid hae roar ` dsin ' auld lang syne.and there 's a hand , my trusty fere!and gie 's a hand o ' thine!and we 'll tak a right gude-willie waught , for auld lang syne .", "summary": " poll found that some 37 per cent do not know a single line of robert burns 's piece , written in 1788 .   and many will be singing it at home this year as more and more opt for a night in on new year 's eve .
