' mr coupland said the victim recalled he tried to get her to touch him intimately , before raping her - even though she told him to stop . jurors were told the next memory the woman had was waking up at 5.30 am to find gray still in bed with her . the woman said gray appeared to be unaware she was ` uncomfortable ' - even when she asked him several times how he had got into her home . she eventually plucked up the courage to call him a taxi and , as he was leaving , spotted the broken security chain . she told the jury gray said : ` do n't worry , i 'll fix it ' , causing her to lose her temper and push him out of the house . later that day , she told a friend her version of what had happened , then called gray ` to go through the sequence of events ' . however , she said gray appeared ` cold ' , and when he asked her , ` does this put you off me ? ' , she hung up . the next day , she spoke with a police officer friend , who reported the matter to her superiors . gray claimed he had returned to the woman 's home and found her door ajar before forcing his way in because he ` thought something might have happened to her . ' he told the jury he ` fell back into his mode as a trained police officer and decided he would enter to save a life effectively ' , before finding the woman sitting up in bed awake . the court heard gray , who was suspended after his arrest , told officers she had initiated sex , and the pair had ` parted on good terms ' with a kiss on the doorstep the following morning . he said he had no idea anything was wrong until he received her call . the court was told the pair had met on a night out with mutual friends around a month before the attack on july 24 last year . they swapped phone numbers and exchanged ` jokey ' texts before meeting for a drink . the woman said gray appeared ` articulate , funny and pleasant ' , and they met again a few days later . however , the woman said that despite only having a few drinks , she ` could not remember much ' of the evening ' , and just had a ` vague recollection ' of being unable to understand why gray got out of the taxi at her house . the woman added : ' i never invite people back to my house . even if i have decided someone is ok , it is not something i do . i did not even find him attractive . ' i vaguely remember saying he needed to go , i needed to go to bed , and he needed to get a taxi from the top of the road . he went out the back door . ` my memory is of locking the door and putting the chain on . i remember being woken by the bell ringing lots and lots of times . i just ignored it and went back to sleep . ` the next thing , i was aware of a naked person . he was over me . i was in bed . i said  do n't do that  . it was not what i wanted .
