{"text": "updated : . 02:37 est , 16 february 2012 . a grocer claims supermarket staff banned him from his local store after he bought vegetable oil to use as fuel in his vehicle . chris waites says managers at his local tesco in didcot , oxfordshire , told him it was illegal for him to buy vegetable oil and use it as fuel in his delivery van . he claims the ban came after he purchased six five-litre bottles of vegetable oil to fill up the van he uses for his grocery business . dispute : supermarket bosses at the didcot branch -lrb- pictured -rrb- said they were ` investigating ' the matter . the transit van has been adapted to run on vegetable oil . it is not thought to be illegal to purchase vegetable oil to be used as bio fuel . mr waites said he clashed with staff at the store when he bought the bottles of oil and told them what he was using it for . tesco said it was investigating the matter and stressed that it does not prevent customers from buying products . he said when he returned to the supermarket on saturday to buy other items , he was told he was no longer welcome because using vegetable oil to run a vehicle was a criminal activity . he said : ' a member of staff told me in front of lots of other customers that i was no longer welcome at the store because i had been using vegetable oil illegally for my van . criminal offence ? the grocer claimed staff told him it was illegal to buy vegetable oil to use as fuel . ` using vegetable oil to run a vehicle is not illegal and it was embarrassing to be branded a criminal in this way in front of lots of other shoppers . ` normally we get given the vegetable oil free from pubs and restaurants but on this occasion i 'd gone to tesco . ` we deliver groceries to people in rural areas but i ca n't imagine tesco are trying to stop me from using my van because they feel threatened by the competition . ' mr waites said he had been a customer at the store for seven years and he was not aware of any other reason why he was being banned . he added : ` the day before i bought the oil i went to customer services because the store had overcharged me for a pack of pg tips . i got a refund but that was all sorted out and i ca n't believe tesco are being so petty . ' mr waites , who lives with wife miriam , 27 , said his 2.5-litre ford transit van had been adapted to run on vegetable oil . he added : ' i have been running the van this way for about six years and it 's perfectly legal . the government actually gives you a tax-free allowance every year if you use vegetable oil . we cover about 50 miles a day travelling around south oxfordshire and use about 2,300 litres a year . ' a litre of diesel now costs over # 1.40 at the pumps whereas a litre of vegetable oil costs about 90p . ' in recent years companies have provided drivers with a source of greener , cheaper motoring by turning oil used for frying chips into biodiesel . after collecting drums of used oil from cafis and takeaways , firms refine the liquid into a fuel suitable for most diesel engines . but specially adapted engines , like the one in mr waites 's van , can run on unrefined vegetable oil . biodiesel emits much less unburned hydrocarbons , carbon monoxide and other harmful substances , and does not produce the noxious black smoke associated with mineral diesel . however , biodiesel is not a lover of cold mornings and may cause start-up problems at very low temperatures . tesco spokesman david nieberg said : ` our stores are there to serve customers , not prevent them from shopping . ` we 'd like to stress we do not ban customers for simply buying vegetable oil -- even if it is to put in a vehicle . we are speaking to mr waites to resolve the issue .
