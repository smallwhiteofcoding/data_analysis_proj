{"text": "an oak tree has gone back to its roots - 200 years after it was taken to the other side of the world . as locals emigrated to australia in the 19th century they took with them acorns from an oak tree in holme-on-spalding-moor , east yorkshire . when they settled , the seeds were planted in the families ' own little corner of england . and now a sapling grown from an acorn from one of the trees nurtured in australia has been planted back in the village where the 20,000-mile cross-generational round-trip began . what a family tree ! the acorn taken from the tree in australia -lrb- pictured -rrb- has returned home 200 years later as a sapling . digging in : aleck brown , 6 , and younger sister katy , 3 , plant the sapling in the same village where it was originally taken from . the journey was prompted after someone read a book about people from east yorkshire moving to all corners of the earth . the tree 's story begins in the 1820s . when the british government offered land for settlers to populate . western australia fearing the french might try to land there . the call was answered by a tiny group of farmers from northern england including the clarksons family from yorkshire holme house . in 1829 the clarksons and 37 other passengers set sail from hull on the ship the tranby destined for a new life - accompanying a handful of acorns from a tree growing on the family farm . the seeds survived despite being crammed onto a tiny ship for an eight month journey and they even dodged a meteor strike that struck the ship , before eventually being planted by the settlers in their new home . now 183 years later saplings from the trees those acorns became at the settler 's new australian home have come all the way back again - and they 've been planted by the grandson and granddaughter of the family who now live in holme house . at holme-on-spalding-moor primary school aleck brown , six , and his young sister three-year-old katy had the honour of planting the extraordinary sapling . putting down some roots : the amazing journey has come full-circle thanks to someone in australia seeing a book written by dr robb robinson about people from hull moving all over the world . dr robb robinson , whose book prompted the move , with the australian sapling and the oak tree at holme hall in the paddock . aleck and katy 's grandparents michael and pat rhodes live at holme house , the place where the original tree still stands where the acorns came from . the amazing journey has come full-circle thanks to someone in australia seeing a book written by dr robb robinson called far horizons - from hull to the ends of the earth . dr robinson , from the university of hull , said he wrote the book to chart the stories of people leaving hull for other parts of the world and one of the stories was about the fabled acorns . he said : ` around the 1820s the british government were worried the french might settle western australia as we did n't have many people living there . ` they issued a call in all the national newspapers asking for settlers who would be willing to go there . ` it was a big risk , they had to take all their farming equipment and livestock and if had to arrive before january 1831 to guarantee them a plot of land . ` the clarksons were just one of the family 's who left from east yorkshire and north lincolnshire on an 87-foot-long ship , the tranbranching out : the tree , which has flourished in australia , was grown when a family packed up and emigrated in the 1800s . ` it was an eight month journey to australia with around 37 passengers and 14 crew along there was plenty to contend with on the way , in fact the ship was hit by a meteor en-route killing a sheep and breaking a dog 's leg . ` when they arrived the settlers made a home for themselves on an area of land called the perth peninsula not far from modern-day perth . ` in honour of the journey one family built a house named after the ship , tranby house , which remains one of the oldest or the oldest building in western australia . ' dr robinson , who published his book telling the story of the tranby and others in 2011 , said he was amazed when a few months later he was contacted from australia . he said : ` when i saw the two oak trees at tranby house i realised they came from the acorns taken over with the settlers , i jokingly said  could you send some acorns over ?  and they did . ` we planted the seeds in the botanical gardens at the university but then we thought how fitting it would be if they returned to the spot where they came from .
