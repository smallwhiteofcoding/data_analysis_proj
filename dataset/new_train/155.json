{"text": "just what the world needs -- another wiener . a new mexico politician with a surname remarkably similar to shamed former u.s. representative anthony weiner is in hot water after a professional photographer snapped him with a group of scantily-clad young women . michael wiener , who serves as the republican bernalillo county commissioner , is now facing calls to resign after the provocative photograph . layover ? commissioner michael wiener of new mexico , centre , claims he was posing with ` bar girls ' in the philippines at the photographer 's request and was only in angeles city because of a layover . the photo in question was taken by seattle-based photographer john keatley , who was in angeles city in the philippines to document the thriving sex tourism industry there . history : michael wiener serves as the republican bernalillo county commissioner in new mexico . wiener vehemently denied the claims , telling albuquerque station kob , which first broke the sensational story , that he was only in the red light district for a few hours while he waited for his next flight . he said : ` we went there to take a look ... walk up walking street and then went to the airport . ' the commissioner said he was only touring the district with his fiancée during a layover . they were flying to see his daughter , the commissioner said . the picture of him and the woman he identified as his fiancée may be viewed on mr keatley 's personal blog , along with other photos of angeles city 's red-light district . according to mr keatley , wiener first identified the woman accompanying him as his girlfriend . however , when kob looked into his flight schedules , they could not find a flight schedule to caticlan , where his daughter was . in an interview with the albuquerque journal , wiener would not say whether or not he knew he was wandering around the red-light district . he did say that he ` just wanted to take a quick tour , ' comparing it to people wanting to see the casinos at las vegas , even if they did n't gamble . mr keatley , who works as a professional photographer who shoots portraits and advertising , told a different tale . he told tpm 's muckraker blog ` it was very obvious to me that -lrb- wiener -rrb- was not respectful to women . he was there to have a good time . ' the photographer said that people travel the world over to visit the city 's booming red light district.he said that he heard wiener making inappropriate jokes to the women -- called ` bar girls ' -- suggesting that one of them touch his penis . wiener vehemently denied the claim . ` i may have made a comment like do n't get too close to my girlfriends here , but i did n't mention anything like that , ' wiener told kob . the other weiner : former congressman anthony weiner -lrb- d-ny -rrb- was forced to resign after a series of illicit photos were posted to his twitter account ; he is seen speaking in june of last year . laid bare : weiner denied claims that he sent a picture of his bulging underwear to a young woman , but confessed last june that was , in fact , him . he also issued a statement thursday that read : ` i 'm a hard-working commissioner who has a right to take a vacation , to visit my fiancée and my daughter . i did absolutely nothing wrong - i was a tourist on my own time -- not there on county business -lrb- sic -rrb- my time is my time ! ' in the statement , he rhetorically asked : ` if i was doing something wrong -- why would i pose for a picture ? ' now , wiener is facing considerable heat to resign from his public office position . michelle lujan grishman , who serves as a commissioner with the new mexico state bar , said the photos call for wiener 's resignation . she told kob : ` during most of his career at the county , there have been allegations of inappropriate behaviour that borders on racism , sexual harassment , hostile work environments , and these pictures seem to condemn human trafficking and then exploitation of women . ' last year , wiener was cleared in an investigation after a female staffer complained that he made off-colour , sexually explicit comments to her , saying : ` did you know that the -lrb- county commission -rrb- now has a wiener and a johnson on it ? ' though he admitted that he made the statement , wiener said it was intended to be taken as a joke.the albuquerque journal noted another gaffe , where he referred to a santa fe man as ` very hispanic and not very sophisticated -- very very blue collar . ' during their encounter in the red-light district , mr keatley was unaware that wiener was a politician , and had no idea who he was until wiener handed him his email address and requested that mr keatley send him the photos . wiener is up for re-election this year .", "summary": " new mexico commissioner michael wiener photographed with four filipino ` bar girls ' on recent trip .   wiener claims he was exploring red-light district while on layover .   shares remarkably similar surname to shamed former u.s. rep. anthony weiner .
