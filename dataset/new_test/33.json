{"text": "filmmaker michael moore , whose new documentary  sicko  takes on america 's health care system , faced off tuesday with cnn chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon dr. sanjay gupta . michael moore and cnn 's sanjay gupta argued tuesday about gupta 's report on moore 's film  sicko  moore criticized a report gupta did on cnn monday on  sicko .   he said the facts were fudged ,  moore said , referring to gupta , on cnn 's  larry king live .   that 's a lie . none of the facts are fudged .  moore and gupta shouted and argued over data gupta used and data moore used . moore said his staffers backed up the film 's facts to gupta before the report aired and that gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong . gupta disputed that . watch moore , gupta make their points   we try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find ,  he said .  michael has a lot of different numbers . ... you 're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports .  both agreed , however , on the basic premise of  sicko  : problems abound in america 's health-care system and need to be fixed .  i thought it was a good movie , and i wanted to say that ,  gupta said .  i think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it 's broken . we get it .  he praised moore for raising awareness of the issue . however , gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as france and canada have universal health care -- suggests that health care in those countries is free . while patients may not pay for services at the doctor 's office , they do pay high taxes to fund such a system , something gupta said he was concerned that  sicko  audiences might not realize . moore responded by saying americans pay more in copays , deductibles and insurance premiums .  we -lsb- america -rsb- have a system built on profit ,  the moviemaker said . he asked gupta if the current system , which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures , is cumbersome to him .  it 's a shameful system , especially when i 'm dealing with some of my patients ,  gupta said . but he questioned moore 's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the bush administration , which moore fiercely criticized in the past , particularly in his film  fahrenheit 9/11 .   the government actually used to do things right ,  moore said in response .  the problem is who we put in power .  moore has adamantly opposed the war in iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war 's success abounded in washington .  i am sorry we 've taken so much time trying to correct -lsb- gupta 's -rsb- facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue  -- the ailing health care system , moore said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
