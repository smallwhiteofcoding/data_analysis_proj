{"text": "mohammed alshaya owns more high street brands than most fashion addicts could stuff in their closets . mohammed alshaya , ceo of alshaya 's retail division , tells mme he sees a new mindset in the gulf . topshop , coast , next and river island are just some of the big names he 's imported from the united kingdom to shopping centers in the middle east . as chief executive of m.h. alshaya , he knows what sells : tried and tested western brands that will appeal to local shoppers . and his empire is not limited to clothing . in the past month , he 's taken mothercare and the body shop to central eastern europe . with the addition of the czech republic , hungary and slovakia , m.h. alshaya now operates in 16 markets including saudi arabia , kuwait , united arab emirates , bahrain , qatar , oman , lebanon , jordan , egypt , cyprus , turkey , poland and russia . john defterios spoke with mohammed alshaya , and started by asking him for his thoughts on the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- plans for a single currency . -lrb- jd -rrb- : i would imagine as a retail operation you 'd be a huge proponent of a single currency within the gcc . is it realistic within the next 4 to 5 years ? -lrb- ma -rrb- : i think it can be , as long as there is a will of the leaders to get together and decide . it is a huge leap towards efficiency , conciliation , getting closer between the six countries . one single central bank that governs and regulates is much better than the current six , i believe . -lrb- jd -rrb- : have you ever done any calculations of what impact it would have on your back office operations ? -lrb- ma -rrb- : not yet , but it will be great , i think . -lrb- jd -rrb- : you 're one of the largest retail operations throughout the arabian peninsula . with all this growth that we 're seeing right now , it must have a direct impact on the retail sector . what sort of annual growth are you experiencing ? -lrb- ma -rrb- : we 're experiencing close to 25 percent annual growth , if not 30 percent in some cases , like in dubai . -lrb- jd -rrb- : do you have any sort of concerns that this is going to be a bubble like the 1970s where the money was not deployed correctly ? it seems different from my vantage point , do you share that view ? -lrb- ma -rrb- : there is a new generation of people from the region that are leading businesses and strong leadership in the government that have mitigated any concern . and if you see now the statistics , the gulf is the seventh largest economy in the world . in ten , in 15 years time , it will be the fifth . so i see a new mindset , a new attitude . -lrb- jd -rrb- : one of the other things i wanted to ask you about is your moves into other countries . the alshaya group is very well known throughout the arabian peninsula , but you 're moving into other markets , into eastern europe , specifically into russia . do you have the expertise to go into these markets ? -lrb- ma -rrb- : well , yes . we have the expertise , and the expertise is by really retaining good management , and traveling with them into new markets . i 'm not going to open shops myself . we have a very strong team in russia ; russians that are taking our investment into good projects like starbucks which we opened two months ago , two stores . we acquired a business there . so we have plans like mothercare , bodyshop , next . -lrb- jd -rrb- : so you can basically move this group into any city and have that potpourri of offers ? -lrb- ma -rrb- : we have the software . we have the software to launch the retail portfolio into a new market . -lrb- jd -rrb- : obviously you 're a family business . you feel quite strongly about preserving culture and the family structure , and the need for family businesses to create jobs , because they represent 75 percent of all turnover in the gulf . -lrb- ma -rrb- : we have a social responsibility toward our people . we have to make sure we have jobs for them if the government is not going to compete , and is going to take away some of the people who would be relevant to our business . another issue that might challenge us to do that is the wealth creation -- whether -lrb- potential employees -rrb- would be attracted to be in a department store selling or in a coffee shop making coffee -- that , we will see . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
