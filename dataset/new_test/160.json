{"text": "president bush blasted the democratic-controlled congress on tuesday for having  the worst record in 20 years .   congress is not getting its work done ,  bush said , flanked by members of the republican house leadership .  the house of representatives has wasted valuable time on a constant stream of investigations , and the senate has wasted valuable time on an endless series of failed votes to pull our troops out of iraq .  bush criticized congress for not being able to send  a single appropriations bill  to him .  they have n't seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it ,  he said . democrats quickly fired back . jim manley , senior aide to senate majority leader harry reid , said ,  taking advice from president bush about fiscal responsibility and getting things done for the american people is like taking hunting lessons from dick cheney . neither is a very good idea .  rep. rahm emanuel , d-illinois , issued a statement saying ,  president bush 's rally this morning reminds us that congressional republicans remain ready and willing to rubber-stamp the bush agenda : no to children 's health care ; no to a new direction in iraq ; and no to investing in america 's future . the white house and congressional republicans want to continue the status quo .  bush said the senate was  wasting valuable time  by taking up the children 's health insurance bill , which he had earlier vetoed . watch bush describe what he thinks congress is doing wrong  house majority leader steny hoyer , d-maryland , issued a statement calling bush  the biggest obstacle  to extending health coverage to  10 million low-income , working-class american children .  hoyer said gop house leaders need to  stop posing for pictures , and sit down with democrats and republicans in congress who are working together to extend coverage to our children .  the state children 's health insurance program measure passed in the house last week would expand the program by nearly $ 35 billion over five years , the same as the measure bush vetoed on october 3 . bush had proposed adding $ 5 billion to the program , and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state-run program . democratic leaders said the new version addresses republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving schip benefits ; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program ; and preventing adults from receiving benefits . the program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for medicaid , the federal health insurance program for the poor , but who ca n't afford private insurance . democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million , paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes . bush said congress knows the current version of the children 's health bill  does not have a chance ,  to get enough votes to override another veto . hoyer accused bush of breaking a promise he made in 2004 to extend coverage under the schip program .  now , congress must do what the president said he would do ,  he said in his statement . the senate could vote on the bill as early as tuesday . bush also threatened to veto a  three-bill pileup .   there are now reports that congressional leaders may be considering combining the veterans and department of defense appropriations bills , and then add a bloated labor , health and education spending bill to both of them ,  he said .  congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner ,  he said . bush also urged congress to send him a  clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill .   they ought to get me a bill that funds among other things bullets and body armor ,  he said . bush also criticized congress for trying to  hold hostage  funding for troops .  it would be irresponsible to not give our troops the resources they need to get their job done because congress was unable to get its job done ,  he said . hoyer 's release said bush 's comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility  ring hollow .   the fact is , this administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in american history , turning record surpluses into record deficits and adding more than $ 3 trillion to the national debt ,  he said .  democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today because we believe our government must pay for the things it purchases and not force our children to pay our bills . the fight over 2008 appropriations bills is not a fight over spending . it is a fight over priorities .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
