{"text": "amstetten , austria josef fritzl , who austrian police say has confessed to imprisoning his daughter for 24 years and fathering seven of her children , twice holidayed in thailand while she remained trapped in a cellar below his house , according to german media reports . josef fritzl appeared in court after admitting raping his daughter and fathering her seven children . germany 's bild newspaper quoted a holiday companion , identified only as paul h , who said he and 73-year-old fritzl traveled to thailand together twice and spent time in each other 's homes .  he went -lsb- to thailand -rsb- without his wife ; apparently she had to look after the children . ... once he had a very long massage from a young thai girl at the beach . he really loved that ,  paul h told the newspaper , which featured video of fritzl laughing and receiving a massage in thailand on its web site .  once i saw how josef bought an evening dress and racy lingerie for a very slim woman in pattaya -lsb- thailand -rsb- on the beach . he got really angry when he realized i saw him . then he told me that he has a girlfriend on the side . the items were meant for her . he told me not to tell his wife .  watch footage of fritzl on vacation at a thai beach resort  the pair had also ventured to oktoberfest . paul h said he had visited fritzl 's house three times , the last in 2005 .  we sat out on the terrace and had a really nice evening . ... the kids were well-behaved , however ; they had a great respect for their father . they were never allowed downstairs into the cellar , but we never thought anything of it ,  he told bild .  now that i think of the dungeon down there , i feel really sick in the stomach .  paul h said fritzl was a diy  genius ,  constantly extending and building on to the house . meanwhile , family members at the center of the incest and imprisonment case have held an  astonishing  reunion , medical officials said .  they met each other on sunday morning ,  clinic director berthold kepplinger said tuesday .  and it is astonishing how easy it worked , that the children came together , and also it was astonishing how easy it happened that the grandmother and the mother came together .  investigators say fritzl held his daughter , elisabeth , captive in a cellar for 24 years . he raped her repeatedly , they say , and eventually fathered seven of her children . elisabeth and two of her children were reunited sunday with three of her other children and her mother , kepplinger said tuesday . the three children and her mother lived in the home above the cellar . elisabeth 's eldest child , 19-year-old kerstin fritzl , remains in hospital . a seventh child died years ago , shortly after birth . fritzl told police he burned the infant 's body in a furnace . the story of the family 's imprisonment began to unravel a week ago , when kerstin fell seriously ill with convulsions and was hospitalized . austrian police wednesday denied reports that they were investigating possible links between fritzl and the unsolved murder of a woman . franz polzer , director of the lower austrian bureau of criminal affairs , said fritzl had owned an austrian hotel near where a woman was found murdered decades ago . however , they were not investigating the incident at this stage . meanwhile , an austrian girl who was held prisoner in a basement for eight years said the family faced a long period of adjustment . see how austrians are troubled by the case  natascha kampusch was 10 years old when she was kidnapped on her way to school in march 1998 . she escaped from a bunker below the house of wolfgang priklopil in a suburb of vienna in august 2007 . priklopil killed himself by throwing himself under a train only hours later .  although they are now in a secret location , i believe it might have been even better to leave them where they were , but that was probably impossible ,  she said of the fritzl family tuesday .  yes , because that was of course the environment they were used to , and now they 're somewhere else . pulling them abruptly out of this situation , without transition , to hold them and isolating them to some extent , it ca n't be good for them .  officials said tuesday that dna testing had confirmed fritzl fathered the children . his dna also was found on a letter sent to the fritzl family that was made to look like it was from his daughter , elisabeth , polzer said . see inside the ` house of horrors '  authorities said fritzl sent other letters over the years , leading the family to believe that elisabeth was a runaway who had abandoned three of her children on their doorstep . he dictated at least one of the letters to his daughter , they said . authorities said it did not appear that fritzl 's wife , rosemarie , knew about her husband 's activities . reports have surfaced in the times of london and austria 's presse that fritzl was convicted of sexual assault in the 1960s , but there is nothing in his record to confirm this , said district governor hans heinz lenze . he added , however , that records were expunged after a certain number of years . prosecutors were checking archives to find the information , said gerhard sedlacek , prosecutor for the state of poelten . the times of london quoted a 50-year-old neighbor who said that when he was 10 , he remembered  how we children were afraid to play near mr. fritzl 's house because of the rumors that he had raped a woman and spent some time in jail for it .  watch a report of how the case unfolded .  fritzl led police to the cellar sunday . a day later , he confessed to raping his daughter , now 42 , and keeping her and their children in captivity , police said . fritzl was able to convince social service workers , friends and family that elisabeth had run away in 1984 , when she was about 18 . the father , who police described as an authoritarian figure , forbade anyone from entering the cellar . in the cellar with elisabeth were kerstin and two sons , aged 5 and 18 . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's phil black , nadine schmidt and eileen hsieh contributed to this story .", "summary": "no summary"}
