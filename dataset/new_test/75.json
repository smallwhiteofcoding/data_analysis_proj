{"text": "san diego , california you must know what 's really driving the immigration debate . it 's the culture , stupid . ruben navarrette jr. : some opponents of immigration , even the legal kind , fear changes in local culture . immigration restrictionists -- and by that , i mean those who want to limit all immigration , even the legal kind -- like to pretend they 're so high-minded . yet they ca n't help themselves . they always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants . the restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns : that our borders are n't secure , that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally , and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here . really ? if that 's the extent of it , then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on american culture through everything from taco trucks to spanish-language billboards . that seems to be the issue in north dakota , where , according to a recent article in usa today , towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them . in cooperstown , the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy , because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who ? american kids who work at starbucks ? nope . the article quotes orville tranby , a local community leader in cooperstown , who says that some residents have told him  face to face  that such facilities might attract hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture . you 'll find the same fear in lewisburg , tennessee . not long ago , an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in spanish . townspeople wanted no part of that . they demanded that all books purchased by the library , or even donated , be in english-only . these stories are ridiculous , but they 're also helpful . they illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration , and it goes well beyond words like  legal  or  illegal .  it 's the perception that the country is becoming more hispanic , that spanish is replacing english , that hispanic immigrants are weakening american identity , and that main street is turning into little mexico . a leader of the vigilante minuteman movement moronically called it the  colonization  of the united states . this sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy , that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners , and that our children are going to live in a world where they 're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up . it conjures up the alarm bells that benjamin franklin set off about german immigrants in the late 18th century , who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the english , but would  swarm into our settlements , and by herding together establish their language and manners to the exclusion of ours .  it popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that chinese immigrants were  unassimilable ,  which led to congress approving the explicitly-named chinese exclusion act of 1882 . and it helped welcome the 20th century when massachusetts sen. henry cabot lodge warned that immigrants -lrb- read : the irish -rrb- were diluting  the quality of -lrb- u.s. -rrb- citizenship  and others complained that italian immigrants were uneducated , low skilled , apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity . where have we heard that before ? and when will we hear it again ? after all , hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists . but they wo n't be the last . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . you can read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
