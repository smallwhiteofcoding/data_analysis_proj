{"text": "solid support from registered democrats and women in new hampshire were crucial tuesday as sen. hillary clinton rebounded from her third-place finish in last week 's iowa caucuses . sen. hillary clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change washington . she narrowly defeated sen. barack obama in the new hampshire primary , with 39 percent of the vote to obama 's 37 .  last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice ,  the new york senator said after her victory .  now let 's give america the kind of comeback that new hampshire has just given me .  forty-three percent of self-styled independents said they voted for obama , and 31 percent said they backed clinton . independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled . addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called , obama congratulated clinton . but he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between clinton and himself .  but the reason our campaign has always been different , the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago , is because it 's not just about what i will do as president ,  he said .  it is also about what you , the people who love this country , the citizens of the united states of america , can do to change it . that 's what this election is all about .  but clinton was ahead of obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered democrats . those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents . clinton also claimed the majority of women 's votes , according to the polling . that 's in contrast to last week 's iowa caucuses , in which obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from clinton . analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the clinton turnaround .  if i had a single word , the word would be ` women , '  said cnn political analyst bill schneider .  she got the women back .  and schneider said the support of union voters that put clinton over the top .  union voters have her a 10 point lead ,  he said . cnn projected former sen. john edwards to finish third . college graduates , who made up 29 percent of the electorate , opted narrowly for clinton -- 38 percent to obama 's 37 percent , according to the polling . those polled who called themselves very liberal , and moderate , went with clinton over obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split . pundits also were citing the role of former president bill clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to obama in new hampshire . the former president spent tuesday in hanover -- home to dartmouth college -- where obama had been expected to win handily .  they dispatched him to the area that obama was surging ,  said cnn analyst donna brazille , who managed former vice president al gore 's campaign in 2000 .  i think it had the effect of tamping down obama support and giving senator clinton a real reason to come back in this race .  new hampshire was considered crucial to clinton 's campaign . if obama had been able to sweep iowa and new hampshire -- after months of clinton being considered the front-runner among democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries .  age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting clinton ,  schneider said .  sixty-seven percent of democratic primary voters are over the age of 40 , and they are breaking heavily for clinton over obama .  over the past several days , clinton has trumpeted her experience , saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator . after losing to obama in last week 's iowa caucuses , it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be obama 's ability to electrify american voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process . the duel between the obama and clinton campaigns grew especially testy monday and tuesday . she said she had more experience than he , and was therefore more qualified . he accused her of representing the status quo of washington . and on the eve of the new hampshire primary , bill clinton criticized the media for not pressing obama more fully on iraq , and accused the illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in iraq . then , there was an issue unto itself -- hillary clinton 's almost-tears . clinton 's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter 's question about her health and appearance . pundits and voters alike questioned whether clinton 's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely , too cold . in front of the crowd of mostly female new hampshire voters , an admittedly fatigued clinton responded to a question by saying :  this is very personal for me , it 's not just political , it 's -lsb- that -rsb- i see what 's happening , we have to reverse it .  her voice broke , and she was then applauded by the crowd . polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters , according to cnn 's john king , but turned off some female voters . edwards was followed in votes by new mexico gov. bill richardson and ohio rep. dennis kucinich . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
