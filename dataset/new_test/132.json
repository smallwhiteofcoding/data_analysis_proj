devastating southern california wildfires . a plane drops fire retardant on the fourth day of a wildfire pushed by winds through pauma valley , california . winds that gusted as much as 101 mph on sunday dropped to about 30 mph wednesday evening . meanwhile , the dry santa ana winds that have fanned the flames , changed direction and began blowing inland from the pacific ocean , increasing the humidity and easing the burden on almost 8,900 firefighters in the area . but the destruction was taking its toll on the men and women on the front lines of the fires .  it hurts us to have those homes lost . it hurts us to have those injuries . and it is frustrating for us to watch our community be devastated by this ,  said firefighter andy menshek . as conditions improved , officials allowed people to return to communities that had been off-limits because of intense flames and dense smoke .  it was home ,  said mark davis , whose two-story rancho bernardo house burned to the ground .  it was us . we had been there 28 years , and it had a lot of our flavor .  the change in the weather also meant that firefighting aircraft -- grounded for most of the week by the winds -- could finally fly . california department of forestry and fire protection capt. scott mclean called the droning sound of aircraft the  sound of joy .   their drops are hitting their mark because the wind is not there ,  he said . the rate of burning had slowed significantly by wednesday . still , the fire damage increased to 434,543 acres , said gov. arnold schwarzenegger . watch schwarzenegger

the raging flames of the santiago fire  the smaller rosa fire in riverside county , 70 percent contained at just over 400 acres , was also a probably arson , state officials said . as the fire danger eased , residents were allowed to return to several neighborhoods surrounding san diego : del mar highlands , encinitas , solana beach , carmel valley , chula vista and otay mesa . helicopters were back in the air over the lake arrowhead , california , area after all air activity had been suspended because of extremely smoky skies . in nearby running springs , cnn 's ted rowlands stood in the midst of charred , smoldering rubble strewn with potentially deadly power lines .  it will be a while before these people will come back . when they do come back , unfortunately they 'll have this pretty much to look at ,  he said wednesday . watch rowlands describe a major battle with the flames  about 500 homes were lost in the mountainous region in san bernardino county east of los angeles . see photos of the fires   yesterday we could n't be here , because just this little flame and smoldering pieces of wood would be thrown by the intense winds . ... now you can see the flames just basically burning themselves out ,  said rowlands . the fires have already destroyed 1,664 structures -- including 1,436 homes -- and they still threaten 25,000 more , schwarzenegger said wednesday . the blazes have killed three people and left 40 hurt , he said . the governor will fly over the area thursday with president bush , who signed a major disaster declaration wednesday . watch bush emphasize the need to be responsive  it 'll speed federal dollars to people whose property losses are n't covered by insurance and will help local and state agencies pay for the emergency response .
