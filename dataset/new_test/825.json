' things do n't get settled within a hour .  touma , a five-year army veteran , had served with the u.s. army dental activity clinic in bamberg , germany , and in fort drum , new york , before her stint at fort bragg . she is the second female soldier from fort bragg to die under suspicious circumstances since june . army 2nd lt. holley wimunc was killed in early july . her fayetteville apartment was torched july 10 , and her charred body was found nearby a few days later . her husband , marine cpl. john wimunc , was charged with arson and first-degree murder in connection with the death . another marine , lance cpl. kyle alden , was charged with arson and felony accessory after the fact to first-degree murder . camp lejeune , north carolina , also had a homicide case involving a female service member this year . the charred body of marine lance cpl. maria lauterbach , 20 , was found in the backyard of another marine stationed at the base , cpl. cesar laurean . lauterbach was eight months pregnant when she died . laurean , who has been charged with first-degree murder , was arrested in mexico in april , but because he holds citizenship in the united states and mexico , he can not be immediately deported and must go through an extradition process . authorities have said that if he chooses to fight extradition , it could take two years to return him to north carolina . cnn 's marylynn ryan contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
