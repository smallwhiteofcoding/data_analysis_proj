{"text": "brussels , belgium european leaders agreed friday to send an 1,800-strong security force to maintain stability in kosovo , although they stopped short of backing independence for the province . french soldiers at the nato-led peacekeeping mission in kosovo last month . kosovo is expected to declare independence from serbia early in the new year . serbia , however , insists the region should remain autonomous within its borders . speaking at the end of a one-day summit of european heads in brussels , jose socrates , the portuguese prime minister currently holding the european union presidency , said that sending the security mission was a  political decision .  the police and security force is expected to be deployed to the balkan state ahead of an announcement of independence .  this is the clearest signal that the eu could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region ,  socrates said . according to cnn 's robin oakley in brussels , european leaders are trying to balance an obvious readiness to back kosovan independence with incentives to serbia , which is seeking membership of the eu . eu leaders are deeply conscious of their failure in the early 1990s to move early enough to prevent the bloodletting in the balkans over the break-up of the former yugoslavia , he said . although most eu leaders support serbia becoming a member state to boost stability in the balkans , french president nicholas sarkozy said that serbia 's membership is dependent on it recognizing kosovo 's independence and handing over war criminals . socrates confirmed to cnn that any fast-tracking of serbia into the eu could only be considered if it agreed to hand over ratko mladic , the bosnian serb general wanted at the the hague for suspected war crimes . two years of negotiations on the future status of kosovo ended in failure earlier this week , when talks mediated by europe , the united states and russia ended without an agreement . the disputed province is dear to the serbs , orthodox christians who regard it as serbian territory . but it is equally coveted by kosovo 's ethnic albanians , muslims who have a 90 percent majority . since 1999 the united nations has been running the province with nato peacekeepers , who still number 16,000 . oakley said the eu mission to kosovo would help to ease the handover from the u.n. to local authorities . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
