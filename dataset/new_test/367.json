{"text": "colleen hiltbrunner spent two years researching her dream trip to south africa . but she was n't looking for the perfect safari lodge . she was hunting for the right cosmetic surgeon . when she told her family , it was n't an easy sell .  south africa ? you 're going to get some kind of witch doctor ,  she recalls her father saying .  but i told him they perfected some of the first heart surgeries down there . to me , south africa had the most reputable surgeons .  hiltbrunner , of colorado springs , colorado , traveled to johannesburg in 2004 for a face-lift , upper arm lift and eyelid surgery . and she and her husband -- who had n't taken a vacation in 20 years -- went on a luxury safari , included in the package by medical-travel agency surgeon and safari .  medical tourism  may sound strange , but patients are discovering they can get some cosmetic surgeries abroad for less than the u.s. price . and many surgeries include sightseeing packages . the roster of countries in which hospitals and surgeons are marketing their services to foreigners is growing . south africa , argentina , thailand , brazil , costa rica , india and singapore have become major players . robert painter , a travel writer from albuquerque , new mexico , journeyed last year to argentina for dental surgeries -- and tango lessons :  if i 'm going to be stuck somewhere for two weeks at a time , twice , buenos aires has got to be the best possible place ,  he says . painter 's procedures were organized by plenitas , a medical-travel facilitator in buenos aires , which booked him at a hotel with a dance studio in the back . he was n't the only guest getting surgery :  while i was there , there was a young lady who was also having implants -- though not of the dental type .  cost-cutting pros and cons . cosmetic , or elective , procedures are n't covered by insurance , so cost remains the motivating factor for most medical tourists . surgeries in many countries cost half or even one-fifth what they would in the u.s. -- including airfare , hotel and excursions .  a full face-lift that would cost $ 20,000 in the u.s. runs about $ 1,250 in south africa ,  a 2005 article in u-daily , the university of delaware 's online news service noted . faith richter , of hope sound , florida , got a face-lift in bangkok , thailand . her trip was organized by new york city 's med journeys .  in the u.s. , it would have cost $ 20,000 for the procedure alone , with no time in the hospital ,  she says . in bangkok , richter was in the hospital four days , and the total cost of her 19-day trip , including sightseeing and airfare for two , was $ 10,600 . painter estimates he saved $ 18,000 on his surgeries .  cost was the primary factor ,  he says .  the only factor .  medical costs abroad are less than in the u.s. for many reasons -- favorable exchange rates , lower salaries and fewer medical lawsuits , which means lower malpractice-insurance costs . but the international society of aesthetic plastic surgery warns against low-cost surgery .  get bargains on your shoes and laundry detergent , not on your face ,  says spokesman tony staffieri .  researching the quality of doctors should be a patient 's primary consideration , but it is n't always ,  he says .  some people think ` tummy tuck and shopping . ' this is not makeup ; it 's somebody cutting you .  some medical professionals fear that patients will overlook the severity of invasive surgeries and fail to ask the right questions . more casual attitudes toward plastic surgery -- spurred by lunch-break botox treatments and same-day liposuctions , paired with temptingly cheap alternatives and vacation packages -- increase the risk of bad outcomes . even stateside , cosmetic surgery can have tragic results .  first wives club  author olivia goldsmith died during a chin-tuck in 2004 , and this year kanye west 's mother , donda , died after a tummy tuck and breast reduction . however , a 2004 study published in the official medical journal of the american society of plastic surgeons , plastic and reconstructive surgery , found that  deaths occurring at office-based surgery facilities -lrb- in the u.s. -rrb- are rare -- less than a quarter of a percent .  quality surgeons . medical tourism experts counter criticism by saying that cheaper prices do n't necessarily mean lower quality of care .  in general , it is the hospitals and facilities that have justifiable claim to ` world-class ' status or to meeting or exceeding u.s. standards that are competing for patients from the united states and other countries ,  says jeff schult , author of  beauty from afar : a medical tourist 's guide to affordable and quality cosmetic care outside the u.s.  the authors of a 2006  new england journal of medicine  article confirm the high standards of internationally accredited hospitals :  we doubt -lrb- ... -rrb- that the average u.s. hospital can offer better outcomes for common complex operations .   almost 80 percent of the doctors we use have been trained in the u.s. or u.k. ,  says tim wallace , vice president of sales and marketing for med journeys .  it gives the american consumer a degree of confidence .  richter , a registered nurse , agrees that standards are high abroad .  after the surgery , the nurses were there for me 100 percent ,  she says .  at home , we 're so understaffed and overburdened , and inundated with paperwork .  when painter visited u.s. dentists ,  i felt like i was being processed for a home loan ,  he says .  in argentina , i had three dentists working on me at once .  while medical tourism continues to increase in popularity , it 's still not mainstream . when richter left for bangkok , she  did n't tell a soul , not even my seven children , who are almost all in the medical field . they would have had a stroke .  at thanksgiving , though , they were all saying , ` you really do look good .
