{"text": "from a country which brought the world brands like sony and toyota , there 's another name that 's crept quietly to global prominence . hello kitty , the moon-faced cat with a bow in her hair and no mouth . shintaro tsuji , ceo of sanrio , famous for its hello kitty brand , speaks in the boardroom . she 's one of 450 characters developed by japan 's sanrio group , but she 's by far most popular -- the embodiment of what 's known in japan as kawaii , or the culture of cute . her image adorns some 50,000 objects , from cute , of course , to downright crazy . but there 's nothing cute about the numbers . hello kitty is responsible for more than half of sanrio 's billion dollar annual turnover . her creator and founder of sanrio is the effervescent 79-year-old shintaro tsuji . he told the boardroom 's andrew stevens what he thinks is the marketing secret behind a cultural icon . tsuji : selling something which people want to buy is one of the ways of doing business . but i thought , goods that i want are also something other people want . so we wanted to make goods which people want to send to somebody else as a gift . the idea is that goods are for social communication purposes and that has been accepted worldwide . in addition , to give hello kitty goods as a present is very thoughtful . our three concepts of friendship , cuteness and thoughtfulness have been reaching out to people . it conveys the importance of being friendly . such gestures are necessary for the japanese nation . you care about other people by sending some gifts . those concepts have been accepted worldwide . stevens : my first question to you is sanrio has developed something like 450 characters . why it is hello kitty has stood out so much more than the others ? what is the secret of its success ? tsuji : at first we were using characters which were created by outsiders , such as cartoonists or artists , but in this case we had to pay the royalty . so we decided to create our own characters . we hired many artists and asked them to create various characters . according to our own research , the most popular animal character was a dog then a white cat and the third one was a bear . snoopy already existed as a dog character -- that 's why we went for the second most popular character . we asked the artists to design a character based on a white cat . stevens : let me just ask you a question about your life , growing up . reading your autobiography , you lost your mother when you were 13 years old . you went to live with your auntie . and you describe your life ; your childhood , has been a quite lonely . how do you think that has shaped you in your business life ? tsuji : i felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything ; to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life . then i asked myself how can you make friends -- in what way people can make a friend with those people . that is not just to avoid behaving , which makes people uncomfortable . but do something , which makes people happy . in this way people can make friends . for example , when people are ill , you can say something to them , or when people did something for you , you say thank you to them . for those kinds of occasions , you send a small present rather than an expensive gift . it is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way . this idea has formed as a business . as a result , hello kitty was created . hello kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends . i am pleased with this phenomenon . stevens : what , in your business career , is the most important lesson you think you 've learnt ? tsuji : a good company means that , first of all , its sale increases each year and secondly it makes profits each year . this is what people call a quality company . but this is not my main concern . obviously , a company should n't lose money . a company can not contribute to a society easily . but for me , it is important to establish a company , which has a good reputation . stevens : much easier said than done , how do you remain true to your original ideas , though , because there are so many pressures from shareholders among other people to make those profits ? tsuji : the company shareholders actually say  make more profits or dividends .  but what i always say to them at the general assembly is that the shareholder should be someone who truly values my company and is proud of having my company 's share . according to newspapers , there are companies which make a profit by polluting the environment or breaking laws . but this is not acceptable by our standard . i bet the company staffs want to have an increase in the wages . but i want my staffs to be proud of themselves , in particular , when their children ask them where they are working . in my view , that is very important . stevens : what advice would you give to someone starting out their own company in 21st century ? tsuji : it is not only about making profits or establishing a huge corporation . a bigger country does n't mean a better country . having a larger military capacity does n't mean a better thing . it will be ideal to establish a company which is a value to the world . it 's not just about the money . so i would say  how about creating companies which people appreciate ?
