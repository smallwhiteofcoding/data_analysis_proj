{"text": "north korea 's apparent cooperation with nations seeking to end its nuclear weapons ambitions -- six years after a deal collapsed and two years after testing a bomb -- may lead to questions about why it would play ball now . some signs show north korean leader kim jong il does intend to drop his nuclear weapon program , experts say . one school of thought : the communist nation , in desperate economic straits , has long been willing to drop its program for better relations with the united states . but mistakes on both sides interfered , according to jim walsh , a national security analyst . north korea could be trying to achieve survival through deceit , intending to keep its nuclear weapons as blackmail for better treatment , analysts suggest . but those making a case for north korea 's sincerity , walsh said , would say it must  do the things economically that -lsb- it needs -rsb- to do to avoid collapse .   having nuclear weapons when the regime is collapsing wo n't do them much good ,  said walsh , a research associate at the massachusetts institute of technology . north korea , following a 2007 agreement with five nations including the u.s. , handed over a declaration of its nuclear program on thursday . the nation also took steps to disable a reactor that officials acknowledge helped extract plutonium to build nuclear weapons . on friday , it destroyed the reactor 's cooling tower -- significant because the tower would take a year or longer to rebuild . watch the tower being demolished .  after north korea 's declaration , president bush said thursday that he intends to move north korea from the u.s. list of states that sponsor terrorism . down the line , north korea would receive economic and energy assistance if the u.s. and other nations agree it is complying with other efforts to dismantle its nuclear program . north korea has been heavily sanctioned in the past because of its nuclear program . stephen hadley , the u.s. national security adviser , told reporters thursday that the terror list was one incentive for north korea to drop its nuclear ambitions .  i think it is important to them not to be on a list that says ` enemies ' and not to be on a list that says ` supporters of terror , '  hadley said . walsh said north korea has been weakened by sanctions and its lack of arable land , leading to a population unable to feed itself .  it ca n't grow enough food ,  walsh said .  and they 've got to attract foreign investors .  he said north korea was better off in the days of the soviet union , when it had an ample amount of communist nations with which to trade . but the soviet union collapsed , and many other nations turned away from communism , leaving north korea increasingly isolated .  geostrategically , north korea was growing weaker , and everyone around them was growing stronger ,  walsh said . in 1994 , north korea pledged to the u.s. that it would freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid , including help building two power-producing nuclear reactors . by 2000 , however , north korea was complaining that not all the aid was coming as promised . in 2002 , the u.s. accused north korea of working on a secret nuclear weapons program , and the u.s. said north korea admitted doing so . countries including the u.s. halted oil supplies , and north korea withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty . it conducted an underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 . walsh said both sides have n't fully lived up to previous agreements . the u.s. , he said , promised normalized trade at one point but did n't follow through . jon wolfsthal , senior fellow of the center for strategic and international studies ' international security program , said north korea has been  remarkably consistent  regarding its reactions to u.s. positions .  when we 've engaged them directly , they have responded . and when we have reduced our commitment , to our engagement ... they have responded negatively ,  wolfsthal said . wolfsthal said china -- which provides oil and food aid to north korea -- has been instrumental in getting north korea to cooperate .  china has gone from being an uninvested ... mediator to being a true participant in this process -- from a country that originally wanted to help the u.s. and north korea work out their differences to a state that has worked to convince north korea to meet its obligations ,  wolfsthal said . wolfsthal said he believes china was embarrassed by north korea 's nuclear test , and shifted course .  i think that over time , the united states has helped china see that north korea 's unpredictable behavior destabilizes their own backyard ,  he said . walsh and wolfsthal said another theory has it that north korea is only playing with negotiators and intends to keep its nuclear program and weapons as a security blanket . expanding on that possibility , wolfsthal said north korea leader kim jong il could keep the country 's nuclear arsenal but agree not to produce any more nuclear weapons .  everybody 's speculating . none of us has met kim jong il ,  wolfsthal said . walsh said the west does n't have hard evidence to determine north korea 's intentions .  but so far , the evidence is pretty strongly on the side of north korea wanting a real bargain ,  walsh said .", "summary": "no summary"}
