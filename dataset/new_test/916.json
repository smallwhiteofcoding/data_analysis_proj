{"text": "los angeles , california there 's no question  tropic thunder  takes chances . ben stiller , left , and robert downey jr. are among the stars of  tropic thunder ,  a hollywood satire . tom cruise almost unrecognizable as a foulmouthed , foul-mannered movie executive ? check . mockery of action heroes , method actors and gross-out comedians ? check . challenging stereotypes at every opportunity ? absolutely . but casting robert downey jr. as a black man ? well , that might be a bit much . or maybe not . in  tropic thunder ,  a comedy about self-absorbed hollywood types making a  platoon  - style war movie , downey plays australian actor kirk lazarus , a multiple oscar-winning performer who gets so involved in his roles that he forgets to come out of them . he 's a man constantly looking for ways to transform himself for his art . so , cast as a black man in the war movie , lazarus decides to dye his skin surgically . downey -- no slouch as an actor himself -- has often been seen as one who immerses himself fully in his roles . that kind of dedication prevented the character from coming off as offensive , said ben stiller , who directed , co-wrote and stars in  tropic thunder .   i give all the credit to robert ,  stiller told cnn .  i felt he really was so committed to that character , the guy that was playing that guy , that as an audience you bought his sincerity . very few people , i think , could pull that off .  brandon jackson , who plays hip-hop star turned actor alpa chino -lrb- say it fast -rrb- , agreed .  robert was black the whole time . my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle ,  he told cnn .  i 'm serious . that 's how black he was .  watch jackson talk about working with downey  the movie , which also stars stiller as struggling action star tugg speedman and jack black as gross-out king jeff portnoy , features some testy altercations between downey 's lazarus and jackson 's chino . lazarus gets so involved in his role that even when it 's clear filming has wrapped for the day , he sticks with it -- which irritates chino to no end .  to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what he 's doing is crazy the whole time ,  downey said .  otherwise it 's just demeaning to brandon 's character . and if it 's demeaning to an actual black man in the movie ... i would have run for the hills .  jackson said he would have challenged the movie if the material was offensive . but , he said ,  tropic thunder  is a long way from the days when white performers would don blackface as a way of exploiting black stereotypes . since then , he said , the playing field has leveled : the wayans brothers played  white chicks  in the film of the same name , and eddie murphy has played several ethnicities in his films , including jewish and chinese characters .  if we 're all gon na play ball , let 's all play ball ,  jackson said .  i believe in fairness . if we can punch you , punch back . and funny is funny .  ireport.com : will you see ` tropic thunder ' ? stiller , of course , is no stranger to testing comedy limits . the actor , writer and director , known for films such as  meet the parents  and  zoolander ,  has performed or created roles that strike a delicate balance between sympathetic and distasteful -- and sometimes fall too hard on one side of the line . he co-wrote  tropic thunder  based on an idea he had in 1987 , when many of his friends were making war movies , he recalls in the film 's production notes . while stiller was making  empire of the sun ,  his colleagues were in boot camps training for their military roles -- and would emerge talking about the boot camp as if they 'd become part of a real military unit .  this sort of self-important , self-involved thing seemed funny to me ,  he said in the notes .  i just could n't figure a way to make that into a movie .  not immediately , anyway . but after several years , stiller and his colleagues worked out a story that not only mocked actors , but filmmaking in general . in  thunder ,  after the studio threatens to shut down the big-budget production , the frustrated director -lrb- played by steve coogan -rrb- refuses to stop , and takes his cast deep into a southeast asia jungle to shoot  guerrilla style .  there they encounter danger in the form of drug lords .  tropic thunder ,  which already has received praise from newsweek 's david ansen and the hollywood reporter 's kirk honeycutt , has also earned its share of knocks . the most serious have come from advocacy groups for the disabled , which are planning to picket monday 's los angeles premiere . in the film , speedman has made a bid for an oscar by playing  simple jack ,  a developmentally disabled character . other characters in  tropic thunder  dismiss speedman 's attempt to play what they refer to as a  retard .  representatives of the special olympics , the arc of the united states , the national down syndrome congress , the american association of people with disabilities and other groups met with studio executives last week to discuss the film , but dreamworks did not make any changes .  we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population ,  said peter wheeler , a spokesman for the special olympics , according to reuters . in a statement sunday , chip sullivan , a dreamworks spokesman , said the movie was  an r-rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the-top characters in ridiculous situations .  in the statement , sullivan added that the film was not meant to disparage or harm people with disabilities and that dreamworks expected to work closely with disability groups in the future . in junket interviews for the film , stiller said that screening audiences definitely found  tropic thunder  funny .  you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think you 're doing , of what you think is the right idea ,  he said .  if people are accepting it the way that you intended , and you feel that from a general audience ... then stand behind it .  downey trusts that after years of making themselves known as actors who can skillfully walk that fine line between funny and offensive , audiences will accept the film 's satire -- his role in particular .  i just hope at this point , with whatever little we 've done to brand ourselves as entertainers , that you give us a little slack ,  he said . cnn entertainment correspondent kareen wynter contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
