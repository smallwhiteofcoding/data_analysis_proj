{"text": "johannesburg , south africa white students at a south african university tricked black residence hall workers into eating stew containing urine , prompting a march wednesday in which five people were arrested , university officials said . students protest against a racist video on the campus of free state university in bloemfontein , south africa . the white students made a video of the incident , which they staged in reaction to the university 's efforts to integrate its residences , according to a statement from the university of the free state . the protesters on wednesday included black and white students who later marched to the residence where the video was made and demanded that it be shut down , witnesses said . the video surfaced on tuesday but was made in september , the university said . in the video , white male students at reitz residence are seen encouraging at least three black female housekeepers to participate in what the students call the  reitz fear factor ,  an apparent reference to the television show in which contestants eat live worms or compete in other feats . watch excerpts of video that sparked outrage  in one scene from the video , a student mixes what looks like a beef stew in a plastic bowl and adds garlic and other items . then he tells the camera he will add the  special ingredient .  the student then urinates into the mixture , which he later stirs up and puts in a microwave . other students can be heard laughing on the tape . the next scene shows a different student urging at least three housekeepers to drink cups full of the stew , saying ,  this is our dorm 's ` fear factor . ' we want to see who has the best ` fear factor . '  on the video , the student does not tell the women that there is urine in the mixture . the women , on their knees , spit the stew into buckets after tasting it . some appeared to vomit , but the women also laughed during the incident as the student urged them on . next , the women struggle to run in what appears to be a race . the video is put in slow-motion as the theme from  chariots of fire  plays . finally , one of the students awards a large bottle of whiskey to one of the women , telling her she has won the  fear factor .  at the end of the video , a message appears on the screen in afrikaans saying ,  that , at the end of the day , is what we think of integration .  university officials and human rights groups in south africa denounced the video .  the executive management of the -lsb- university -rsb- condemns this video in the strongest possible terms as a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved ,  said ufs rector frederick fourie in a statement posted on the university 's web site .  we have immediately started with a most urgent investigation into this matter ,  he added . later wednesday , fourie met with the employees seen in the video and apologized to them , a statement from the university said . counseling is being provided for the workers , it added . the students involved in the video have been identified and will be suspended , fourie said , and charges against the men will be filed with the south african police service . two of the students in the video are still enrolled at the university but had been barred from the campus in bloemfontein , according to the university . two others completed their studies last year . the students seen in the video have not made any public comment since the video surfaced .  i am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video . i have publicly said several times that the ufs is not a place for racism ,  the rector 's statement said .  the fact that it is openly linked to the integration process in ufs residences is also most disturbing ,  fourie said . a spokeswoman in free state province for the democratic alliance -- an opposition party which says it puts equal rights for all south africans at the center of its policies -- called the video  shocking and inhumane .   it looked like they were willing -lsb- participants -rsb- but they did n't know what purpose the video served . ... it was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat ,  said spokeswoman liana van wyk , the south african press association reported . helen zille , the democratic alliance 's leader , wednesday asked the south african human rights commission to conduct an investigation into racial tensions at the university .  the abhorrent footage of students abusing university workers is a fundamental infringement on the victims ' constitutional right to have their dignity respected and protected ,  zille said in a statement posted on the group 's web site .  this incident is symptomatic of racial tensions that have been simmering at the campus for some time over the issue of hostel -lsb- residence -rsb- integration ,  she said . fourie acknowledged in his statement that  the university is going through a difficult time with its efforts to racially integrate its residences and to create a new residence culture based on diversity , respect , human dignity and human rights .  he added ,  these kinds of actions make it all the more important that we succeed with establishing such a new institutional culture on the campus . i appeal to all staff and students to remain calm and to act in the best interests of the university .  the university , a research center , is one of south africa 's oldest ; founded in 1904 . it has more than 25,000 students , according to its web site , and uses a parallel-medium instruction in english and afrikaans for its full range of undergraduate and graduate programs . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's kim norgaard contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
