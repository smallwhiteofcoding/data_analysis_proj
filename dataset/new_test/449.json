{"text": "boston , massachusetts it all started with the flush of an automatic toilet . the terrifying sound marked the beginning of a two-year nightmare for sarah teres as she desperately tried to potty train her daughter molly . molly graduated from potty school four days before her brother , archer , was born .  it was awful  teres said .  we tried everything including bribery and threats .  teres , the mother of three from andover , massachusetts , hoped her middle child would be toilet trained by the time she was 2 1/2 . two years later , the girl was still in diapers , refusing to use the bathroom .  i was going crazy ,  teres admitted .  she would n't poop . she would hold it for days .  at wits end , teres enrolled molly in the toilet training school at children 's hospital boston .  by the time the children come in with their families , it has become a power struggle ,  explained dr. alison schonwald , a pediatrician who supervises the  poop school ,  as it 's affectionately called by staffers .  the kids kind of dig in their heels and put a line in the sand .  health minute : watch more on the perils of potty training  the american academy of pediatrics reports that most children show signs they 're ready to potty train between 18 and 24 months . doctors suggest a child may be ready to start trying if he 's staying dry for at least two hours at a time during the day , walking to and from the bathroom , asking for a diaper change and asking to use the potty . for some kids , the toilet training process can take more than a year , or longer . the six-week program at children 's hospital is one of a handful around the country . kimberly dunn , a pediatric nurse practitioner , has worked with some of the 450 young graduates over the years . she said most of the kids admit they are afraid to use a toilet .  oftentimes , the parents come in and they want to know why they 're afraid ,  dunn said .  you could ask the kids until they 're blue in the face and you hardly ever find out why .  dunn meets with a half-dozen children once a week . she uses books , music and art to help the students overcome their fear of using the toilet . she helps them set small , realistic goals . for instance , she said , week one involved just sitting on the toilet for five minutes . she encourages positive reinforcement and simple rewards such as extra playtime with mom or dad . while dunn works on the kids , psychologist elaine leclair , an instructor at the harvard school of medicine , offers frank advice to the parents in a separate room .  i just say , ` step back . ' they hate to hear me say this , but i say whatever you 're doing now is not working . you really need to try something different ,  leclair said . she said many parents come to the sessions angry and anxious .  they come in feeling extremely discouraged , very isolated thinking they are the only ones in the world who have this problem .  teres acknowledged that 's how she felt .  imagine my surprise to find out there were thousands of kids who had this problem .  after years of hiding her daughter 's toilet training troubles from family and friends , the group parenting sessions allowed teres to open up about her frustrations .  it was like going to betty ford ,  joked teres , who felt she had exhausted all her other options . a majority of the children who attend the children 's hospital class are dealing with constipation issues often caused by delayed toilet training . teres learned that her daughter had a medical condition called encopresis . experts call it a symptom of chronic constipation and say it occurs when a child resists having a bowel movement . youngsters like molly are sometimes given laxatives or other medications to help encourage them to go . schonwald , the author of  the pocket idiot 's guide to potty training ,  does n't want parents to be discouraged during the process .  no one goes to college in diapers , right ? everyone will get through this time , as awful as it might feel if you 're struggling .  she suggested achieving success during potty training has to do with the approach .  there are three things you can not make a child do : eat , sleep or poop . we find that by decreasing the pressure and expectations that children feel more confident .  schonwald reminds parents that toilet training  is not a chore , so keeping it positive from the very beginning is the most important thing .  if a child is n't using the toilet by the age of 4 , she recommends talking with a pediatrician . schonwald also said setbacks during potty training are normal .  all developmental skills come in spurts with periods of regression .  after a setback , schonwald advises parents to give their child positive messages that they can succeed by saying ,  so you had some accidents today . we 'll try again tomorrow .  four months after graduating from  poop school ,  teres is relieved to report that molly is fully toilet trained .  you would never know this was an issue ,  said teres .  she even used an automatic flush toilet the other day . i waited to see her reaction and she was ok .  e-mail to a friend . judy fortin is a correspondent with cnn medical news . linda ciampa of accent health contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
