'  says sullivan , 32 , who works in marketing .  and there was this silence . and then he was , like , ' i know you 're the one for me now . but can you give me until summer to make a final decision ? '  aghast at his response , sullivan quickly broke things off -- but she could n't move until she found a new apartment . home alone on february 14 in the apartment they shared , she decided to snoop through her ex-boyfriend 's e-mail and discovered he 'd had contact with several other women while they were together .  i 've never been a big fan of the holiday ,  sullivan says .  but now i typically refer to it as black monday ...  watch whether romance is still alive  good times , bad times . sullivan is n't alone in dreading valentine 's day . thanks to super-sized expectations and over-the-top commercialization , february 14 has gone from a sentimental aside to a pressure-filled gauntlet lined with chocolate boxes , tennis bracelets and cheesy stuffed bears . see where the love dollars go   the holiday 's designed to make you feel -lrb- bad -rrb- ,  says judy mcguire , author of  how not to date .   if you 're in a relationship , it 's never anything that it 's supposed to be . and if you 're single , you feel like a big loser because you do n't have anybody . i think people should lower valentine 's day expectations to pretty much nil . that way , anything that happens is good .  brian wise , a 32-year-old technical writer from seattle has seen his valentine 's day go sideways repeatedly -- most memorably the time he ended up in handcuffs -lrb- and not in a good way -rrb- .  last year , i was in singapore and i met this beautiful woman who took me to dinner at this hot , new restaurant , '  he says .  but then she gets food poisoning and ends up in an alley with major gastrointestinal problems . and while i 'm standing guard , the cops pull up and think i 'm paying her for sex .  wise talked his way out of an arrest -lrb- luckily , one of the policemen had eaten at the same place -rrb- but he 's found no release from his unlucky valentine 's .  it does n't matter who i 'm out with ,  he says .  the day is just cursed .  there are ways , though , to avoid a miserable holiday . good plans . most women will admit they like to celebrate , but a fancy night on the town is n't necessary .  sometimes , hanging out at home can be a lot more fun than going out to some restaurant filled with couples ,  says author mcguire .  stay home with champagne , caviar and maybe a new toy from a tasteful sex shop .  if you 're not dating anyone , take some time to indulge yourself -lrb- a luxurious bar of chocolate , a pedicure -rrb- , do something relaxing -lrb- take a yoga class or get a massage -rrb- or spend time with some of your closest friends . make sure you 're on the same page . and if you do make plans , stick to them . galen , a 28-year-old secretary from seattle , and her boyfriend had made special valentine 's day plans a month in advance . but on the big night , his buddies showed up and talked him into going out with them instead .  i was dressed to the nines ,  says galen , who asked that her last name not be used .  when his friends stopped by , he says , ` do you mind if i go with them ? ' i said , ` fine , go , ' being totally sarcastic , and he picked up his coat and left .  although they talked about it later , galen said , her boyfriend seemed not to understand that she was unhappy with his wanting to ditch her for his buddies . the two later broke up . breaking a date on valentine 's day is definitely bad form , but automatically expecting one to happen -lrb- a much more common scenario -rrb- is also problematic . to avoid a disconnect with your significant other , mcguire suggests being honest . simply expecting your partner to know what you want is unrealistic . not-so-good gifts . if you decide to go the gift route , mcguire recommends not settling for a clich√© like a stuffed animal or a hastily purchased bouquet of flowers .  listen to what the person talks about ,  she says .  she may want the new ` godzilla ' game for her wii . his underwear may be riddled with holes .  another thing to avoid , advises katie briggs , 44 , of seattle , is the gag gift . a few years ago , briggs and a new beau went out to a nice restaurant where they shared dinner , drinks and presents . briggs gave her date homemade cookies and a starbucks gift card . he gave her a beautifully-wrapped box -- of spam .  he thought it was the best joke ever ,  says briggs .  but it just was n't thoughtful . if you 're going to go with a joke , you need to back it up with something else .  e-mail to a friend . lifewire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to web publishers . diane mapes is the author of  how to date in a post-dating world .  her column ,  single shot ,  appears in the seattle post-intelligencer .", "summary": "no summary"}
