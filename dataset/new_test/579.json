{"text": "gudda , india in gudda , a village with very little , residents are literally beaming . just two years ago , villagers had never seen light after dark , unless it came from the moon . then , solar light arrived and changed everything . children in gudda stand on rooftops near a solar panel . solar power first arrived two years ago .  when the lanterns first arrived , the villagers asked , ` what is this ? '  says hanuman ram , the local solar engineer .  i explained to them how it worked . then slowly , as people saw it , they said , ` wow , what a thing this is ! '  there are no real roads that lead to the tiny village in the state of rajasthan in northwestern india , home to about 100 families . there are only thin strips of tar dotted with massive potholes that force vehicles into thick brush . other times , cars have to maneuver over just dirt . there is no electricity -- power lines do n't extend out here . water is scarce , too . at the village well , women balance jugs of water on their heads , deftly evading the livestock that saunters along . visit the sites of gudda with cnn 's arwa damon  it 's a simple lifestyle of farming , tending to goats , caring for children and carrying out household chores -- a daily routine that has n't changed much over the centuries . that 's why light transformed gudda . villagers could play music at night . children could study well past sundown . watch villagers smile as they light their solar lamps  as yamouna groomis kneads dough for her family 's evening meal , she blows through a pipe every once in a while to keep a flame burning in an outdoor clay pit . her days used to end when the sun went down . she smiles as she proudly flicks on a solar lamp .  when i saw this light coming on for the first time , i was very happy ,  she says . the light is powered by a solar panel on her roof that charges a battery . panels can be seen on almost every rooftop in gudda . see where gudda is located  ram , the man credited with the transformation , does n't have a high school degree . but he did attend an institution about an hour away called barefoot college , established 35 years ago with an emphasis on helping india 's rural population find solutions for their problems among themselves . the college , in part funded by the indian government , trains villagers all over india who have little or no education , giving them a range of skills to change their lives . the entire campus , which has amenities such as a library , meeting halls , open-air theater and labs , uses solar power . on a recent visit to the main college campus , a group of village women were hard at work making solar cookers , which can boil a liter of water in eight minutes . they are part of the  women barefoot solar cooker engineers society  -- six women who came together and started their own business . barefoot college serves an outlying community of 125,000 people . in a nearby village , women flock to a water desalinization and purification plant set up by the college and maintained by barefoot graduates . the station , powered by solar panels , provides the area with a rare commodity : clean drinking water . at the local store in gudda , owner ram swarup puts his solar panels to maximum use . he says the solar lights have allowed him to increase his business by a third . the panels also have powered up the only dvd player and television in the village . partly paralyzed by polio , swarup never dreamed that he would have so much in life . he says it took courage -- and light . the villagers say that they now feel empowered -- less reliant on a far-off government . even the village 's engineer is amazed . at ram 's house , the solar lamps flicker to life . he smiles as he says that before , he did n't even know what artificial light was , and now , he 's a solar power expert .  i never saw light before ,  he says .  how could i think that i could bring light here ?  like most of the barefoot graduates , he was selected to attend the college by his village elders . now , every night when the lights flicker on , he says , he feels great . with the extra earnings he 's made as a solar engineer , he 's made another of his childhood dreams come true . he purchased his favorite instrument , a harmonium , and now the family can gather around every night and listen to his music . he says he hopes his daughter , now 14 years old , will follow in his footsteps and become a solar engineer . ram 's 80-year-old mother , meanwhile , beams with pride about her son 's accomplishments :  i just wanted him to do something good for the village .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
