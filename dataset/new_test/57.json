{"text": "amman , jordan in the sunbathed schoolyard of the shmisani institute for girls in amman , jordan , principal sanaa abu harb makes an announcement over the speaker system . iraqi students at the shmisani school in amman gather around a teacher . one in 5 students there is iraqi .  all iraqi girls come outside now . all iraqi girls . iraqi girls only !  she repeats several times , making sure the message is clear and waving away jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion . dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground . harb wants the cnn crew to see how many iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating . this school year , she says , 145 students are iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 iraqi children on a waiting list . watch iraqi girls describe a long way from home  the reason behind the jump in the number of iraqis at the school is a new government policy : for the first time since the start of the iraq war , jordan is allowing all iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools . simply , this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked . the move is cementing a massive population shift in the middle east . more than 2.2 million iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland , most of them seeking refuge in neighboring jordan and syria , according to humanitarian officials . jordanian minister of education khalid touqan says he expects jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 iraqi students this year . that 's more than double the number of iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago . harb , on the front line of the phenomenon , says the influx is putting a strain on her school . even with some u.n. and u.s. aid to jordan , there 's still not enough money .  we need more teachers here , more resources , more buildings , more chairs for all iraqi students and our students ,  she says . in a nearby neighborhood , in the study room of the ahmed toukan school for boys , a handful of iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home . seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth , the boys tell stories of horror and displacement . eighteen-year-old qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to jordan to try to live a normal life . matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare , he repeats the number :  five members .  most of the boys and young men from iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation , but also their entry into the workforce . all say , though , that they feel lucky to have gotten out , even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move , ready to live far from home and away from loved ones .  it 's not strange for me to be in the middle of people i do n't know ,  says eleventh grader ziad tarek al shamsi .  i had friends in iraq when i was small , i left them . in america , i left them . i came here , i left them .  he pauses :  but you have to miss your country .  the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age iraqi children are in jordan . many of them are enrolled in private institutions . but as families run out of money they had when they left iraq , they turn to public schools . even so , more than a month into the new academic year , fewer iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year . according to the charity save the children , 21,000 iraqi children have so far enrolled in jordanian classrooms . as a result , the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for iraqi families . the lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees ' fears of being identified through their children 's school records . regardless of what the final number will be this year , the population shift in the middle east is , according to unhcr head antonio guterres , the largest urban refugee situation in the world . iraqi families are changing the social fabric of jordanian society . about 10 percent of jordan 's population is now made up of iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them . the schoolchildren are living examples of how the iraq war may permanently change the middle east .  iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education ,  says touqan , the education minister .  we will not run a parallel system of education .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
