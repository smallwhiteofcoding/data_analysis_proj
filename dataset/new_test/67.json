{"text": "they say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing . but not for these folks ! long before the material girl ordered papa to stop preaching , these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose . alfred hitchcock did n't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors . here 's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form . alfred hitchcock . hitchcock was , without question , one of the towering geniuses of cinema . and , like many greats , he was n't exactly the best collaborator . hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters , who felt he never properly credited them for their work . but he was notoriously hard on actors . he was once quoted as saying ,  actors are cattle  -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry -lrb- actors can be so touchy -rrb- . in response , he issued this correction :  i have been misquoted . what i really said is , ` actors should be treated as cattle . '  although it began accidentally -lrb- when he was short an actor for the film  the lodger  -rrb- , hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films , amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career . ayn rand . the egotist 's egotist , author ayn rand -lrb- born alissa zinovievna rosenbaum -rrb- is the patron saint of thinking you 're better than everybody else . her most famous novels , the fountainhead and atlas shrugged , are massive dramatizations of objectivism , her self-spun oscar-the-grouch philosophy for success . objectivism champions ego and accomplishment , shuns all religion as folly , and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society . rand 's novels often focus on protagonists -lrb- invariably men -rrb- who are shunned by others because of their genius , but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant . not surprisingly , she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as  spitting in your own face .  so , just how much did rand believe in her own philosophy ? let 's just say a lot . with signature modesty , she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of aristotle and thomas aquinas . orson welles . when you create a cinematic masterpiece such as  citizen kane  at the ripe old age of 25 , you 're bound to get a big head . but welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that . in fact ,  citizen kane  might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego . after all , it 's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul william randolph hearst because hearst slighted welles at a dinner party . of course , after the unparalleled success of  citizen kane ,  welles 's arrogant side did n't get any less subtle . do yourself a favor : track down a recording of welles ' outtakes for a tv commercial for frozen peas . you 'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker 's oversized ego . a classic quote goes :  in the depths of your ignorance , what is it you want ?  frank lloyd wright . as the brains behind the robie house , fallingwater , taliesin west , the guggenheim , and countless other design benchmarks , frank lloyd wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture . and , boy , did he know it ! wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals . in fact , the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him . but when you 're wright , you 're right . in 1935 , department store magnate stanley marcus -lrb- of neiman-marcus fame -rrb- commissioned the architect to design his dallas home , but the project quickly went sour . wright 's avant-garde floor plan included  sleeping porches  that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round . in addition , marcus ' small bedroom  cubicles  came equipped with almost no closet space . when stanley respectfully explained that -lrb- a -rrb- temperatures during summer nights in dallas often exceed 80 degrees and -lrb- b -rrb- a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets , wright threw a series of tantrums . fortunately for the voyeur in us all , said tantrums usually took place in letter form . preserved and occasionally displayed at the dallas museum of art , they make for delicious reading . salvador dalí .  every morning when i awake , the greatest of joys is mine : that of being salvador dalí .  yup , he actually said that . everything about the legendary surrealist painter -lrb- he of the melting clocks -rrb- -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock , destroy convention , cause scandal , and stir controversy . criticized for choosing to live under general franco 's fascist government in spain , dalí defended his position by stating that he did n't care about others so long as he could be king . not exactly a man of the people . if he was n't getting enough attention , he was known to walk the streets of new york city clanging a hand bell . of course , this is also the guy who once said ,  the thought of not being recognized -lsb- is -rsb- unbearable .  need another telling quote ?  at the age of 6 years , i wanted to be a chef . at the age of 7 , i wanted to be napoleon . my ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since .  apparently , so did his ego . al jolson . plenty of performers this side of gallagher have been labeled  the world 's greatest entertainer .  but al jolson really , really believed it . the vaudeville singer , actor , dancer , and comedian was born asa yoelson in seredzius , lithuania , in what was then part of imperial russia . as a performer , he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows , ad-libbing , or just stopping to talk to the audience . during a 1911 performance of the critically hated  paris is a paradise for coons  -lrb- title not edited for political correctness -rrb- , jolson stopped and asked the audience if they 'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play . the crowd roared with applause , and jolson ditched the whole program and took over . from that moment on , no one else could share the stage with him . unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list , however , jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance . according to most contemporary accounts , he actually was the greatest in the world . but , despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen , jolson 's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface -lrb- considered highly offensive now , but pretty common at the time -rrb- . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
