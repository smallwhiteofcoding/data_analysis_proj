{"text": "washington an elementary school at the center of a civil rights battle , a hospital ravaged by hurricane katrina and a hangar that once housed u.s. navy dirigibles are on this year 's national trust for historic preservation 's endangered list . sumner was the centerpiece of the landmark 1954 supreme court case brown v. board of education . the 11 sites represent the country 's architectural , cultural and natural heritage , and  reflect extraordinary periods of american history ,  national trust director richard moe said . the sites were chosen from about 70 nominees by the member-supported nonprofit group . founded in 1949 , it aims to protect significant buildings and locales , now protected under the 1966 historic preservation act . of the roughly 200 places listed by the organization in the past 20 years , the national trust says only six have been lost . moe said the list is designed to raise awareness .  the 11 represent the different kinds of historic places in different parts of the country . it 's a representative list ,  said moe , who leads the organization of nearly 300,000 members . endangerment does n't necessarily mean the building is in the potential path of a bulldozer , according to moe . lack of funding can be just as serious , as the case of the california state parks demonstrates . the sites are listed in alphabetical order : . boyd theater , philadelphia , pennsylvania the art deco movie palace known as the sameric was closed in 2002 and is for sale . a local group , friends of the boyd , is trying to save the 1928 theater , the last of its kind in philadelphia . only a few elaborate theaters from that era have survived , and the boyd was the only one built in the downtown area . moe said a  sympathetic developer  could restore the theater . california 's park system the largest state park system in the united states suffers from chronic underfunding , including $ 1.2 billion worth of deferred maintenance , the national trust said . the problem is worsening because of california 's budget crisis . gov. arnold schwarzenegger submitted a budget proposal this year that would have closed 48 parks , but the national trust said the revised budget restored $ 11.8 million of the $ 13.3 million in cuts he requested . current funds cover only 40 percent of maintenance and operations , which means irreplaceable historic and cultural resources remain endangered , the national trust said . the system includes 278 parks , 1.5 million acres and 295 miles of ocean front . many parks house historic buildings such as the 1820s-era franciscan la purisima mission complex near lompoc . charity hospital and adjacent neighborhood , new orleans , louisiana charity hospital , once the main trauma center for southeastern louisiana , was closed after hurricane katrina swamped new orleans in 2005 . the building was declared unsalvageable , according to donald r. smithburg , chief executive of louisiana state university health care services division , which operates university hospitals . there are plans to demolish nearly 200 homes in the mid-city neighborhood to accommodate construction of two new hospitals . alternate locations for the new hospitals are available , and charity hospital could be rehabilitated , according to the national trust . great falls portage , great falls , montana this national historic landmark is one of the best-preserved landscapes along the lewis and clark trail , but a massive coal-fired power plant is planned in the area .  development abutting the great falls portage , an undeveloped rural area under panoramic blue montana skies , will irreparably harm the cultural and visual landscape ,  the national trust said . hangar one , moffett field , santa clara county , california the hangar was built in 1932 to house u.s. navy dirigibles . it is a cavernous , 200-foot-tall , dome-shaped structure sitting on more than 8 acres . a 2003 inspection revealed carcinogenic pcbs leaking from the hangar 's metallic exterior , the national trust said . pcbs were widely used in electrical transformers . the navy transferred hangar one to nasa in 1992 . although the navy remains responsible for environmental remediation , it is not required to preserve the building . lower east side , new york the lower east side in southeast manhattan was home for immigrants and the working class in the 19th and early 20th centuries , but it is becoming gentrified . development threatens historic churches , theaters , schools and tenements ,  a unique architectural type which , by the sheer numbers who lived in such a building , had an impact on more americans than any other form of urban housing ,  the national trust said . michigan avenue streetwall , chicago , illinois this 12-block stretch of historic buildings along michigan avenue between 11th and randolph streets dates back to the early 1880s . the streetwall is a collection of notable buildings by architects including adler & sullivan , louis sullivan , d. h. burnham and holabird & roche , the national trust said . although the stretch was designated a chicago landmark in 2002 , the national trust says its historic character is threatened by the inappropriate addition of large-scale towers that retain only small portions of the original buildings or their facades . peace bridge neighborhood , buffalo , new york the bridge and neighborhood , which has homes and buildings dating to the 1850s , includes two parks on the national register of historic places that are part of frederick law olmsted 's park system . the public bridge authority proposes to expand the bridge and build a 45-acre plaza that would destroy more than 100 homes and businesses , many of which are eligible for inclusion on the national register , the national trust said . according to the organization , the pba has refused to  properly consider  other sites . the statler hilton hotel , dallas , texas when the statler hilton opened in downtown dallas in 1956 , it was considered the most modern hotel in the country . today , the vacant building sits on a desirable parcel of real estate . the statler hilton faces pressure from encroaching development that may lead to demolition . the national trust says a sympathetic developer is needed to restore and reopen the hotel . sumner elementary school , topeka , kansas sumner was the centerpiece of the landmark 1954 supreme court case brown v. board of education . the court 's decision that  separate educational facilities are inherently unequal  helped launch the civil rights movement by declaring school segregation unconstitutional . vizcaya and the bonnet house , florida the development of out-of-scale buildings and corresponding zoning changes will ruin the vistas surrounding vizcaya museum and gardens in miami and the bonnet house museum and gardens in fort lauderdale , the national trust said . such development could set a precedent for high-rise structures , it added .", "summary": "no summary"}
