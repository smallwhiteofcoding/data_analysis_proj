performed at duke university medical center in durham , north carolina .  i am pleased to report that sen. kennedy 's surgery was successful and accomplished our goals ,  dr. allan friedman said in a written statement issued after the procedure .  sen. kennedy was awake during the resection , and should therefore experience no permanent neurological effects from the surgery .  friedman called the resection  just the first step  in kennedy 's treatment plan , which is to include radiation and chemotherapy , to be carried out at massachusetts general hospital in boston . paging dr. gupta blog : mapping ted kennedy 's brain . the 76-year-old massachusetts senator , patriarch of one of the leading families of american politics , said in a written statement earlier that he expected to remain in the hospital for about a week after surgery . he is also expected to undergo radiation and chemotherapy . during such surgery , doctors locate the areas of the brain responsible for key attributes such as movement and speech , and map them to ensure they avoid cutting in those areas . they then attempt to resect as much of the tumor as they believe they can safely remove . watch dr. sanjay gupta explain possible treatment  during such operations -- which friedman and the duke hospital are known for -- surgeons typically ask a patient to identify objects in pictures or make a certain movement , such as squeezing a hand to make sure areas of the brain involving speech and movement are not being impaired . kennedy , a senator since 1962 , suffered a seizure may 17 while walking his dogs at his home in hyannisport , massachusetts . three days later , kennedy 's doctors at massachusetts general said preliminary results from a brain biopsy showed a tumor in the left parietal lobe was responsible for the seizure . friedman is chief of the division of neurosurgery and co-director of duke 's neuro-oncology program , according to the hospital 's web site . he is responsible for more than 90 percent of all tumor removals and biopsies conducted at duke , the web site says . a tumor in the left parietal lobe could affect the senator 's ability to speak and understand speech as well as the strength on the right side of his body , said cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta . hear ireporter describes what gave him strength through brain cancer battle . gupta said such tumors do n't usually metastasize or spread to other parts of the body .  what they do do -- and i think that 's a concern to people -- is that they grow , and sometimes they invade other normal parts of the brain . that is the big concern here ,  he said . malignant glioma is the most common primary brain tumor , accounting for more than half of the 18,000 primary malignant brain tumors diagnosed each year in the united states , according to the national cancer institute . an expert explains potential complications  kennedy is the brother of president john f. kennedy , who was assassinated in dallas in 1963 , and new york sen. robert kennedy , who was assassinated while seeking the white house in 1968 . though his own attempt to seek the presidency failed , edward kennedy has built a reputation as one of the most effective lawmakers in the senate . kennedy 's monday statement focused on the current presidential race as well his surgery .  after completing treatment , i look forward to returning to the united states senate and to doing everything i can to help elect barack obama as our next president ,  he said . obama , the front-runner for the democratic presidential nomination , described kennedy as a  giant  of the senate when the tumor was diagnosed .  i think you can argue that i would not be sitting here as a presidential candidate had it not been for some of the battles that ted kennedy has fought ,  obama said .  he is somebody who battled for voting rights and civil rights when i was a child . i stand on his shoulders .  obama 's rival , sen. hillary clinton , said kennedy 's courage and resolve made him one of the greatest legislators in senate history .  he 's a fighter . there is n't anybody like him who gets up and goes out and does battle on behalf of all of us every single day ,  clinton said .  i know he 's a fighter when it comes to the challenges he 's facing right now .  sen. john mccain , the presumed gop presidential nominee , also offered his thoughts and prayers for kennedy 's family .  i have described ted kennedy as the last lion in the senate . and i have held that view because he remains the single most effective member of the senate ,  mccain said . president bush said in a statement he would keep the senator in his prayers .  laura and i are concerned to learn of our friend sen. kennedy 's diagnosis . ted kennedy is a man of tremendous courage , remarkable strength and powerful spirit . our thoughts are with sen. kennedy and his family during this difficult period ,  he said . kennedy had surgery in october to clear his carotid artery in hopes of preventing a stroke . until the seizure , the powerful democrat appeared in fine health . he suffers chronic back pain from injuries suffered in a 1964 plane crash . cnn chief medical correspondent dr. sanjay gupta and correspondent dan lothian contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
