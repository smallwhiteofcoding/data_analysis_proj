{"text": "if you heard there was a weapon proven to prevent most crimes before they happen , would you run out and buy it ? world-renowned security expert gavin de becker says this weapon exists , but you already have it . he calls it  the gift of fear .  one chapter in gavin 's book  the gift of fear  has stuck with oprah since she first read it . the story of a woman named kelly begins with a simple warning sign . a man offers to help carry her groceries into her apartment -- and instantly , kelly does n't like the sound of his voice . kelly goes against her gut and lets him help her -- and in doing so , she lets a rapist into her home .  we get a signal prior to violence ,  gavin says .  there are preincident indicators . things that happen before violence occurs .  gavin says that unlike any other living creature , humans will sense danger yet still walk right into it .  you 're in a hallway waiting for an elevator late at night . elevator door opens , and there 's a guy inside , and he makes you afraid . you do n't know why , you do n't know what it is . some memory of this building -- whatever it may be . and many women will stand there and look at that guy and say , ` oh , i do n't want to think like that . i do n't want to be the kind of person who lets the door close in his face . i 've got to be nice . i do n't want him to think i 'm not nice . ' and so human beings will get into a steel soundproof chamber with someone they 're afraid of , and there 's not another animal in nature that would even consider it .  for weeks , nicole had a funny feeling that something odd was going on in her apartment .  my gut started feeling like something just was n't right ,  she says .  i would come home , and there would be just weird lights on in my house -- lights that i did n't even remember turning on in the first place .  then one day , nicole noticed a ups delivery box where it should n't be .  i 'm like , ` how did this brand of box get on my back balcony ? '  nicole began to feel uneasy -- but continued to brush it off .  i would just come home , you know , and almost feel nauseous ,  she says .  i kept trying to justify it saying , ` okay , it is in my head . '  nicole 's funny feeling eventually escalated into full-fledged panic attacks , which gavin says were her intuition 's way of telling her that something was wrong .  and intuition records everything . so when she started getting panics attacks , her intuition is saying , basically , ` you 're not going to listen ? okay , i 'll ramp it up . i 'll give you panic attacks . you want sleepless nights ? i 'll give you sleepless nights . '  nicole eventually did listen to her intuition , starting with a simple test .  i dropped a tank top behind the door as i was leaving for work , thinking that when i come home that night , i 'm going to peek my head around the corner . if -lsb- the tank top -rsb- had been pushed to the side , it would have been obvious that the door was opened .  when nicole got home , she says the tank top had moved . caught on camera . the next day , nicole says she set up a hidden camera to try and find out what was going on in her apartment . once she came home , nicole says she plugged the camcorder into her laptop .  and the first thing i see is this man 's head peeking around the corner into my house ,  she says .  what i felt at that point was just complete terror . i 'm sitting there watching this video -- this story unfold -- and this person comes in my house , is looking around , going through my things , looking through my laundry , holding up my lingerie .  as nicole continues to watch in horror , the intruder undresses himself and puts her lingerie on .  so this person is in my clothes , proceeds to start pleasuring himself -- just very , very graphic things happening right there in my house with my belongings . and he finishes up , takes off my clothes -- and puts them exactly back as i had left them -- puts his clothes back on , checks to make sure nobody 's outside the door and leaves .  after watching the tape , nicole says she ran around her apartment , screaming hysterically . she says she had never seen the man in the tape before .  initially , i took my cell phone , called my boyfriend at the time , screaming hysterically . all i could say was , ` he 's in my house . he 's in my house . ' even picking up the phone , dialing , was difficult .  two weeks later , police found the man -- 39-year-old shawn rogers , a computer consultant with a young son and a wife at the time . police were unable to charge rogers with anything more than trespassing ... until he came back to nicole 's apartment to steal her camera . police were able to charge rogers with burglary , and he was sentenced to eight years in prison . dangerous behavior . when nicole found the ups box on her balcony , gavin says this was a warning sign . gavin applauds nicole for listening to her intuition and says that quieting her fear could have caused the situation to escalate .  he 's already into behavior of wanting to get caught ,  he says .  you do n't come back again and again and again and not want to get caught .  gavin says like nicole , the intruder 's intuition was probably trying to tell him something too .  offenders as well can see what 's happening in their lives . and talk about not listening to it -- he 's in someone 's apartment doing something sexual with their clothes on -- that 's something to listen to .  because the intruder had a job and a family , gavin says his behavior was not only reckless , but dangerous as well .  when people do listen , they can stop what 's almost fate ,  gavin says .  there 's a great line that carl jung said . he said , ` what we do not make conscious emerges later as fate . ' if he made it conscious , if he could talk to someone about it , if he could tell someone , he could get better also . but he did n't , and it does mean escalation . if she discovered him , that 's dangerous . if he came in when she was there , that 's dangerous .  your feelings are warnings . doris , who says she endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of her husband , appeared on  the oprah show  after leaving her husband . unfortunately , her battle did n't end there -- two months after she left him , doris 's ex-husband abducted her at gunpoint and raped her . after the show , oprah spoke with doris again to ask if her she had sensed any warning signs the night she was abducted .  as i was coming home from work , it was just a very eerie , strange feeling as i drove up ,  doris says .  it was darker than normal in my driveway , and there was a trash can sitting where i normally park right in the middle .  i thought , ` hmm , this is strange . ' because my mother lives with me , and she 'll turn on the lights when it gets dark . it did give me a little eerie feeling -- the hairs on the back of your neck kind of stand up . but still , i did n't listen to my instincts .  gavin says that  eerie feeling  is exactly what he wants women to pay attention to .  we 're trying to analyze the warning signs ,  he says .  and what i really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign . all the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling . why it was this , why it was that . the feeling itself is the warning sign .  from  the oprah winfrey show  subscribe to o , the oprah magazine for up to 75 % off the newsstand price . that 's like getting 18 issues free . subscribe now ! tm & Â© 2008 harpo productions , inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
