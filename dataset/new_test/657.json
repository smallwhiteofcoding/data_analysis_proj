{"text": "jena , louisiana thousands of protesters clogged the tiny town of jena , louisiana , thursday to show their indignation over what they consider unjust , unequal punishments meted out in two racially charged incidents . officers lead al sharpton , center , through jena , louisiana , during thursday 's protest . they swarmed over the grounds of jena high school , where nooses were hung from a tree in early august 2006 , about three months before six black teens known as the  jena 6  were accused of beating a white classmate . while the tension was palpable , news broke thursday afternoon that the 3rd circuit court of appeal ordered a hearing within 72 hours to determine if the only one of the six still behind bars can be released . the order has  got to be good ,  mychal bell 's attorney , bob noel , told cnn .  it means we have a day in court . any day in court is going to be a good day .  earlier , there was an aura of a pilgrimage at the site where the controversial tree once stood before school administrators had it removed . many people touched the ground and some retrieved a lump of dirt , said cnn 's eric marrapodi . he said the part of the town he was in was ill-prepared for the crowds -- no water or toilets were available . in the background , groups shouted  black power  and  no justice , no peace .  the estimated 15000 to 20,000 demonstrators shut down the town of 3,000 in central louisiana . many residents left for the day , and government agencies , businesses and schools were closed . sgt. tim ledet of the louisiana state police said protesters in buses were still bringing people to town at midday because of the gridlock , but many protesters got off and walked into town on foot .  there is just no room to maneuver in this small town ,  he said . jena resident terry adams disagreed with any accusations that there might be a black-white divide in the area .  we are not a racial town . we get along with each other , we get along fine . this is something that got out of proportion . it really has .  jena 's racial tensions were aggravated in august 2006 , when three white teens hung the nooses the day after a group of black students received permission from school administrators to sit under the tree -- a place where white students normally congregated . the guilty students were briefly suspended from classes , despite the principal 's recommendation they be expelled , according to donald washington , u.s. attorney for the western district of louisiana . a member of the lasalle parish school board -- which had a role in supporting suspension instead of expulsion -- insisted the board is not prejudiced . the panel felt it took the appropriate action , jonny fryar said .  i talked to one of the parents , who called me and said their son thought it was a prank and naive to the fact of what it meant and he was sorry ,  he said .  i hate to see people label us as something we are not . because we have black students and white students playing football together . they shake hands , get along . this is an unfortunate incident . we hope that the community can heal .  although washington acknowledged the fbi and other investigators thought the noose incident bore the markings of a hate crime , a decision was made not to press federal charges because the case did n't meet federal criteria . the students were under 18 and had no prior records , and no group such as a ku klux klan was found to be behind their actions . on december 4 , about three months after the nooses were discovered , six teens , dubbed the jena 6 , were accused of beating classmate justin barker . the six -- mychal bell , robert bailey jr. , carwin jones , bryant purvis , theo shaw and jesse ray beard -- were originally charged with attempted second-degree murder and conspiracy , according to lasalle parish district attorney reed walters . bell , the only one of the six who remains in jail , was to be sentenced thursday after convictions for aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy to do the same , but both charges have been vacated , awaiting further action by the district attorney . charges for bailey , jones and shaw also were reduced to battery and conspiracy when they were arraigned , while purvis still awaits arraignment . the charges for beard , who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime , are unavailable because he 's a juvenile . tina jones , purvis ' mother , condemned walters .  i hope that the d.a. will wake up and realize that he 's doing the wrong thing , and to release these kids ,  she said .  it 's not equal . the black people get the harsher extent of the law , whereas white people get a slap on the wrist per se . so it is not equal here .  jones maintained that her son was not involved in the beating , but watched from a railing , and was not arrested that same day .  we have a long fight ahead of us , and we 'll keep fighting until justice prevails in jena ,  the mother said . purvis , who accompanied her , was asked how he 's faring .  i 'm doing pretty good . i hope there is a pretty good outcome of what 's taking place today ,  he said . watch an interview with one of the jena 6 and his mom  president bush , who was asked about the rally at a news conference , said ,  the events in louisiana have saddened me . i understand the emotions . the justice department and the fbi are monitoring the situation down there .  all of us in america want there to be fairness when it comes to justice .  he advised whoever is elected next year to  reach out to the african-american community .  hundreds of college students from historically black schools such as howard university in washington traveled to jena , along with civil rights activists such as al sharpton and the rev. jesse jackson , who helped organize the event . martin luther king iii also attended , saying ,  this is about justice for the six young men .  sharpton called jena the beginning of the 21st century civil rights movement .  there 's a jena in every state ,  jackson told the crowd in jena on thursday morning . joann scales , who brought her three teenage children on a two-day bus journey from los angeles , california , to jena , made the same point .  the reason i brought my children is because it could have been one of them  involved in an incident like the one in jena .  if this can happen to them -lsb- the jena 6 -rsb- , it can happen to anyone ,  scales said . ondra hathaway was on the bus with scales .  if this young man -lsb- bell -rsb- was railroaded to do time as an adult , how many more people has that happened to ?  she said . jackson said on cnn 's  american morning  on thursday that the charges against the black youths , their possible jail terms if convicted and their bail amounts are  excessive .  punishing the teens with probation would have been sufficient , jackson said . bails for the jena 6 were between $ 70,000 and $ 138,000 , and all but bell have posted bond . bell , 17 , has been in prison since his arrest . the judge has refused to lower his $ 90,000 bail , citing bell 's record , which includes four juvenile offenses -- two simple battery charges among them . bell was 16 at the time of the attack ; 17 is the legal adult age in louisiana . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's susan roesgen , tony harris , kyra philips , eric marrapodi and eliott mclaughlin contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
