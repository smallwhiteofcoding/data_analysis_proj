{"text": "atlanta , georgia they prefer the darkness and calm of early morning when their targets are most vulnerable , still sleeping or under the influence . they make sure their prey -- suspected killers and other violent fugitives -- know what they 're up against . u.s. marshal supervisory inspector james ergas takes aim during a computer-simulated attack .  when they wake up to a submachine gun and flashlight in their face , they tend not to fight ,  says james ergas , the supervisory inspector for the u.s. marshals southeast regional fugitive task force . the u.s. marshals service is the nation 's oldest law enforcement agency and best known for protecting federal judges , transporting federal prisoners and protecting witnesses . less known is the cutting-edge work of the agency 's six regional task forces in capturing suspects . the task force in atlanta is located in a nondescript warehouse office park . in 2007 , the investigators from the southeast task force arrested more than 3,000 suspects ; only once did the marshals exchange gunfire , ergas says . watch ergas blast bad guys in simulated attack   this is the crème de la crème of the marshal service ,  says eugene o'donnell , a former prosecutor and new york city police officer who now teaches at the john jay college of criminal justice in new york . on any given day , ergas and his force are tracking 10 to 15 suspected killers roaming the southeast , while also searching for other violent offenders . already this year , they have been involved in a number of high-profile searches : gary michael hilton , the suspect charged in the killing of meredith emerson who disappeared while hiking in northern georgia ; a fugitive marine wanted in connection with the killing of lance cpl. maria lauterbach in north carolina ; and suspects wanted in connection with the killings of two suburban atlanta police officers . but most of the time they 're chasing suspects outside of the glare of the media spotlight .  our mandate is to track violent fugitives -- murderers , armed robbers , rapists and fugitives of that caliber ,  says keith booker , the commander of the task force . watch booker describe their mission  one suspect currently being hunted is charles leon parker who has been on the run since the 1980s after being accused of molesting his stepdaughters . the marshals were brought in recently , booker says , after parker allegedly called one of his victims and said ,  i wanted you to know i saw you and your daughter , and she sure is beautiful .  o'donnell says it takes highly trained , high energy ,  really special people  to do such work day in and day out , especially when they 're up against  some of the most dangerous individuals in the country .   it 's not an exaggeration to say they 're the front of the front line ,  o'donnell says .  it 's not going to get any more challenging than this in law enforcement .  to make sure they are well prepared , the atlanta office is equipped with a locker full of high-powered weaponry ; a high-tech operations center , complete with flat screen tvs , where they communicate directly with investigators in the field ; a two-story house for training ; and a 300-degree computer simulator that puts the marshals into real life danger scenarios . in one demonstration , ergas steps into the simulator and responds to reports of shots fired at a workplace . a woman rushes to a victim on the ground , as ergas barks out commands . moments later , a man rounds the corner . he too tends to the victim . suddenly , the gunman runs into the corner and ergas opens fire with his glock . the suspect hits the ground . watch ergas say there 's no better training than the simulator  a split second later , another gunman emerges , and ergas blasts him too . think of it as wii on steroids .  these are things you can not get on a range ,  ergas says . there are 50 different scenarios the simulator can create , with a technician able to change each scenario . a trainee can use a shotgun , rifle , glock 22 or glock 23 . the guns shoot a laser and each shot is traced . sometimes , the simulator jams the guns to see how one responds to the situation . after each training session , the person is debriefed about why he or she opened fire or did n't fire at all . each shot is analyzed , because in the real world a law enforcement officer is held accountable for every bullet that comes out of his or her gun . it helps investigators train for situations they could face on any given day , at any given moment , ergas says .  no one wants to shoot anyone ,  ergas says .  even officers that may not have pulled the trigger will be affected by shooting and killing someone .  o'donnell says the fact the task force rarely engages fire with suspects and that they have such rigorous training ,  underscores you can teach tactics .   this is a model ,  he says . booker says it helps having a coordinated team of armed officers with shields and big guns , as well .  we overwhelm them with surprising speed and force ,  he says .  that 's what keeps us safe , and that 's what keeps them safe .  his message for those still out there ?  we 'll pull all of our collective knowledge and resources and investigative techniques to hunt them down and take them into custody ,  booker says .  we wo n't stop until our job is finished .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
