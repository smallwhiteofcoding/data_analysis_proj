{"text": "united nations the united nations is calling on nato to do more to stop the afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates afghanistan 's economy . afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in taliban-controlled helmand province in april 2007 . the report from the u.n. 's office on drugs and crime shows the export value of this year 's poppy harvest stood at around $ 4 billion , a 29 per cent increase over 2006 . despite afghan security forces ' efforts to curb the trade , 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007 , the report said . opium is derived from poppies , and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground . the report said opium has accounted for more than half of afghanistan 's gross domestic product in 2007 . investorwords.com defines gdp as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a calendar year . according to the u.n. survey , about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers . the rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop , to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade . antonio maria costa , executive director of the u.n. office on drugs and crime , urged nato to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade , which has increased dramatically since the american-led invasion to remove the hard-line islamist government of the taliban in october 2001 .  since drugs are funding the insurgency , nato has a self-interest in supporting afghan forces in destroying drug labs , markets and convoys ,  costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey .  destroy the drug trade and you cut off the taliban 's main funding source .  james appathurai , a nato spokesman , said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade .  we share the u.n. 's concerns ,  appathurai told cnn .  drugs not only poison people , but they poison economies and governments , and it is in everyone 's interest to stop this proliferation .  he said nato forces were providing assistance to afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly .  the issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for nato , but at the moment this is a matter for the afghan government ,  appathurai said . farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country , appathurai said . however , he said , in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the taliban stronghold of helmand , poppy production was going on largely unchecked . according to the report , u.n. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes . costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals , like acetic anhydride , that must be smuggled into the region . he called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between afghanistan and its neighbors .  drug trafficking is a transnational threat , and therefore national initiatives have their limitations ,  the u.n. drug chief said . appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on . he also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production .  you can not have eradication in isolation . if we do n't give them the support to produce alternative crops , then by wiping out their opium fields , you are only creating enemies for the future ,  he said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
