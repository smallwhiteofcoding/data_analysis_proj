{"text": "it was two years late and billions of dollars over budget , but this week the singapore airline-owned a380 completed its maiden passenger journey between singapore and sydney . making history : the first double bed on a commercial jet . on board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience . this was a turning point in aviation history as airbus ' superjumbo became the world 's largest aircraft . and the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration . singapore airlines ' ceo , chew choon seng named the jetliner the  queen of the skies  . tom enders , ceo of airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds . and cnn 's richard quest , who was on board the maiden flight , said there was  nothing quite like it  . the luxury on board , he said , sets a new standard for air travel . it 's the quietest large passenger jet ever built -lrb- inside and out -rrb- , it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions , it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort . but the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the singapore airlines a380 is its  beyond first class  cabins . behind the sliding doors of the singapore airlines suites , the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading french yacht designer , jean-jacques coste . there 's a wide leather seat and alongside that , a standalone bed . this is two meters long with givenchy duvets and cushions . and for couples traveling , the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds . from bed or chair , travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen lcd . laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a usb ports and access a suite of office tools on singapore airlines ' in-flight entertainment system . celebrity chefs including britain 's gordon ramsay and georges blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off givenchy tableware . unlike other airlines , that have considered offering casinos , gyms and showers on their future a380s , singapore airlines has opted instead for a configuration that , whilst offering luxury , also makes money . as chew choon seng , ceo of singapore airlines reminded reporters last week , the first boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash . behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats , ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks , as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide . singapore airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $ 5.7 billion . the second is due to arrive next february with further deliveries later in 2008 . tickets for the a380 's first return commercial flight between singapore and sydney were sold at auction on ebay . one passenger paid $ 100,000 for the experience , with the majority paying between $ 1,500 and $ 5,000 . the $ 1.4 million raised has gone to charities in singapore , sydney and a global humanitarian organization . from sunday 28 october , singapore airlines will commence its scheduled service between singapore and sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction . the jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between singapore and london 's heathrow airport . it 's been a long road to this point for airbus , but the journey is by no means over . the airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers -lrb- see figures below -rrb- . next year it plans to deliver 13 , a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010 . tom enders , airbus ' ceo does n't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead .  this is not a piece of cake ,  he told cnn ,  but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers .  it has n't just been airbus that has been frantically preparing for the a380 launch . airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates , as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks . seventy airports are now ready , airbus has said . singapore 's changi airport , home to the singapore airlines a380 fleet , was the first , and when its new terminal 3 opens early next year , 19 gates across the three terminals will be a380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks . heathrow 's new terminal 5 will be able to handle four a380s at one time . british airways , the terminal 's sole occupant , recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants baa to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to terminal 5 to accommodate them . as willie walsh , ba 's ceo told cnn ,  we want to make sure that development is built with the a380 in mind .  but whether the arrival of the a380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided . as cnn 's richard quest points out , while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly , demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as boeing 's up-coming 787 dreamliner . as richard quest says ,  there 's no doubt the a380 will sell , but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount airbus needs to make money .  but those worries , he adds , are for another day . thursday was a day
