{"text": "federal regulators announced $ 7.1 million in fines against american airlines on thursday over maintenance issues and problems with its drug - and alcohol-testing programs . american airlines was fined for allowing aircrafts to fly while they knew they needed repairs .  the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed , and instead deferred maintenance ,  the federal aviation administration said in a statement announcing the decision .  in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft , the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew .  american can still appeal the fines , the faa said . the faa also found the airline maintained inadequate drug - and alcohol-testing programs and failed to inspect safety lighting on a  timely  basis . the fort worth , texas-based carrier said thursday evening that it disagreed with the findings and called the penalties  excessive .   in accordance with faa procedures for handling these matters , we have requested to meet with the faa after we have had time to thoroughly review their findings , so that we may discuss the issues ,  the airline said in a written statement .  since these matters are ongoing with the faa , we will not have any further comment at this time .  nearly $ 4.5 million of the proposed fines stem from american 's continued operation of two md-83 jetliners in december 2007 after pilots reported problems with the autopilot systems , the faa said . the two planes were flown a combined 58 times before the problems were corrected -- and one flew 10 times after an faa inspector notified the airline that it had wrongly deferred needed repairs . in one incident , the autopilot disconnected during a landing on december 21 , the faa said .  american technicians did not check for the actual problem , and instead deferred maintenance using an inappropriate mel -lrb- minimum equipment list -rrb- item . the plane flew another 36 passenger-carrying flights during december 21-31 .  the problem was later traced to a piece of radio gear separate from the autopilot , the faa said . meanwhile , a different md-83 flew four flights without a fully functioning autopilot after american mechanics put off repairs . regulators also accuse american of operating planes without timely inspections of their emergency lighting systems . in april , american canceled more than 3,000 flights to conduct inspections of wiring bundles in wheel wells of its 300 md-80 jets , snarling air traffic for five days . the faa ordered american and several other airlines to examine the wiring , which had the potential to start fires or cause landing gear to malfunction .", "summary": "no summary"}
