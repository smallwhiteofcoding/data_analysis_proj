{"text": "editor 's note : reese witherspoon , the academy award-winning actress , is honorary chairman of the avon foundation and is employed by avon products as its global ambassador . reese witherspoon says she wants to banish the myth that young women are not at risk for breast cancer . every three minutes in the united states , a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer . as a woman , a mother , and a daughter , i find that statistic terrifying . i was never na√Øve about breast cancer , but hearing this statistic put it all into perspective . women close to me have battled the disease and are now soldiers in the greater fight against it . but the moment i heard  every three minutes ,  i felt vulnerable and scared as i realized that anyone is susceptible . the only way for me to ease my fears was to take action . i needed to educate myself and others on this disease . as the honorary chair for the avon foundation , i had resources at my fingertips . i had access to an entire organization that is dedicated to giving back to women and educating people . so i started asking ,  what do i need to know ?  it was through that curiosity that i found out the most important fact in breast cancer : early detection saves lives . according to the avon foundation breast cancer crusade , there is a 97 percent five-year survival rate when breast cancer is caught before it spreads to other parts of the body . when breast cancer first develops , there are usually no symptoms , which is why women need to perform self-exams regularly and contact their doctor upon noticing even the smallest change . of course talking about breast cancer and breast health is a personal thing . i too am a private person but encourage all women to break through their reservations and talk to their doctors and physicians . we must also banish the myth that young women are not at risk for breast cancer . at the avon walk in washington , i met young survivors who were diagnosed in their 20s , an age when most women are graduating from college and just starting their lives as full adults . watch reese and larry at the avon walk  women in their 20s and 30s should have a clinical breast exam by a health professional at least once every three years and women 40 and older should have an exam every year . i am passionate about fighting this devastating disease . i fight for my mother , myself , my children and future generations of women , so one day we will not have to be afraid of breast cancer . i began my fight by learning important first steps in breast cancer detection , and will not end my fight until every woman can stand together saying we are breast cancer free . more than anything else , i have faith -- faith we will find a cure . i saw this commitment in the faces of the women in washington -- in the faces of the women walking and the women and men who stood on the sidelines encouraging the 3,500 participants to the finish line . i was cheering right along with them , screaming for action to find a cure . avon 's next walk will take place in new york city on october 4 and 5 .", "summary": "no summary"}
