{"text": "greencreek , idaho it was just 2 1/2 years ago when elaine sonnen found out that her 16-year-old son , richard , had been planning a columbine-style attack at his high school . richard sonnen spent 16 months in mental health institutions after plotting to kill his high school classmates . it would be a fitting payback to his high school classmates who richard said relentlessly bullied him .  i always wanted to get back at them ,  richard sonnen said of his classmates .  i always wanted to strangle them . ... i was always mad . i was always angry and i would come home and cry to mom and dad .  both richard and elaine sonnen spoke to cnn at the 45-acre family farm . unlike columbine and recent school shootings at northern illinois university and virginia tech , elaine sonnen did see the warning signs in her son and was able to stop him . elaine and her husband , tom , adopted richard from a bulgarian orphanage when he was just 4 1/2 years old .  i mean , we just loved him , and he was just a big sparkle of life ,  she said . but only a few months after they brought him home , they began to see another side of their son . he was angry and unpredictable . elaine sonnen says that at age 6 , richard told her he wanted to kill her . she said he would shake with anger to the point that he 'd scream at her , telling her he wanted to destroy her .  people thought he was just the greatest kid in the world . very polite , well-mannered , caring ,  elaine sonnen remembered .  at home , he could be anywhere from just a really helpful kid to a monster . a terrifying monster .  mother says son had ` two ' personalities  in junior high , he said ,  evil  classmates started picking on him . boys and girls , he said , bullied him until he could n't take it anymore .  i always wanted to get revenge ,  he said . by the eighth grade , richard was put on anti-psychotic medications . he had been diagnosed as bipolar and was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and other disorders . in 1999 , when the columbine shootings happened , the sonnens feared that richard might do the same thing one day .  we stopped and looked at each other and said , ` this could be richard ; some day this could be him , '  elaine sonnen said . years later , during his junior year in high school , they were right . fed up with the bullies , richard says , he felt like an outcast and started looking for a way to get even . secretly , he began reading books about columbine in his school library . the shooters , eric harris and dylan klebold , became his heroes .  they planned it out so perfectly and so meticulously ... that i just , wow , you know ,  he said .  they 're my gods .  watch a preview of  campus rage   he even created a hit list of the classmates he planned to kill at prairie high school in cottonwood , idaho .  my plan was to set around bombs around the school . ... i analyzed a lot of where everybody sat and where everybody did their thing ,  he said .  i had pinpoints of where i wanted to go , where i wanted to do it .  harvard medical school psychologist william pollack , who consulted on a 2002 federal government study of school shootings , said it found that most school shooters often had feelings of anger , sadness and isolation as well as homicidal and suicidal thoughts .  we see a young man who obviously is telling us how depressed he was , how angry he was and how much he looked up to people who we know are very disturbed and very dangerous , and how close he came to killing people ,  said pollack , who watched cnn 's interview with richard . elaine sonnen found out about her son 's plan during a conversation with him . she ordered him to write down the names of the eight students he wanted dead and then gave the list to his caseworker the next day . later , he added a teacher and his mother and sister to the hit list . she took immediate action and had her son committed to an idaho mental institution . over the next 16 months , he received treatment at several mental health facilities throughout idaho .  there , i opened up . i felt better . i moved on with myself ,  richard said .  they felt at that point ... they had done everything they could do for him ,  elaine sonnen added .  he was doing great . he could make it on his own . they had no question .  in january 2007 , after almost a year and a half in mental institutions , richard sonnen started a new life at lewis-clark state college in lewiston , idaho . he was taking a cocktail of three anti-psychotic drugs to help him function .  -lsb- for -rsb- the first time in 12 years , i was able to hold my son ,  said elaine sonnen .  so i knew he was on the road to be well .  everything seemed to be looking up , but in april 2007 , three days after the virginia tech massacre , richard 's mother received a call from police . they told her richard had made about four threats to carry out shootings at lewis clark state college and lewiston high school . police told her richard planned to go home , get some guns and go back to school to pull off a sniper attack from a clock tower on the college 's campus , she said . police took him into protective custody and searched his apartment for clues . but , in the end , he was released because , authorities say , they did n't have enough evidence to charge him with a crime . richard said the whole incident was a big misunderstanding . he said he was telling people about his high school plot and never threatened his college or local high school . but his mother does n't believe his version of the story .  no . i believe he made those threats ,  she said .  i still believe it .  richard , now 19 , signed an order banning him from campus for one year . today , he lives on his own in washington state . he 's still on medication but not seeing a psychiatrist . since he 's over the age of 18 , his mom ca n't force him to go . is elaine sonnen still afraid of her son ?  yeah , at times , i 'm very afraid ,  she said .  because he still has a lot of anger towards me .  she said the signs are still there , and she fears what could happen if he ever stops taking his medicine .  he 's not getting the help and the insight from a professional that could see the signs ,  she said .  because as a person with a mental illness , you have skewed thinking .  even though richard calls her the  greatest person in the world ,  elaine sonnen protects the family by keeping an alarm on her son 's bedroom door when he comes home to visit . so why are richard sonnen and his mother , elaine , speaking out now ? in the wake of the northern illinois university and virginia tech shootings , richard wants young people experiencing the same symptoms he had to seek out help . his mother wants parents and authorities to listen for warning signs and to act fast and decisively . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
