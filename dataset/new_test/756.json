{"text": "sen. barack obama decisively defeated sen. hillary clinton in north carolina tuesday , but clinton 's narrow victory in indiana will likely send the race for the democratic presidential nomination on to the next round of primaries . sen. barack obama and his wife , michelle , greet supporters in raleigh , north carolina . as polls closed in indiana , clinton had a double-digit lead over obama , but by the end of the evening , clinton 's lead had shrunk , dragging the race out until early wednesday . a clear winner did not emerge until 1:15 a.m. wednesday -- seven hours after the polls closed -- because results were slow to come in from lake county , a chicago suburb in northwestern indiana with several precincts that went strongly for obama . by wednesday morning , all absentee ballots had been counted in lake county and the final results showed obama had taken the county by 12 percentage points . there were 115 delegates at stake in north carolina and 72 in indiana . because democratic delegates are awarded proportionally , obama added four delegates to his lead , according to cnn estimates . obama earlier claimed a decisive victory in north carolina . with 99 percent of precincts reporting , obama held a 14-point lead over clinton . watch analysis of nc , in primaries   some were saying that north carolina would be a game-changer in this election . but today , what north carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in washington ,  obama told supporters in raleigh , north carolina . watch obama thank his supporters  obama took an overwhelming 91 percent of the black vote in north carolina , according to exit polls , while clinton claimed only 6 percent . clinton took 59 percent of the white vote compared to 36 percent for obama , according to the polls . clinton told her supporters in indianapolis ,  it 's full-speed on to the white house .  watch clinton greet her supporters  clinton made a strong pitch to blue-collar workers in indiana . she pulled a majority of the votes in rural and suburban indiana during tuesday 's primary . in cnn exit polling , clinton took 53 percent of the vote in suburban areas , compared with 47 percent for obama of illinois . she took 68 percent of the rural vote compared with obama 's 32 percent . in all , 1,738 voters were polled . clinton had pitched herself as the candidate best-suited to turn around a flailing economy and consciously courted working-class voters in the state -- even driving a pickup truck up to a gas pump once to help promote her proposed temporary rollback of federal tax on gasoline .  i believe that americans need a champion in their corners ,  she said at a rally in indianapolis .  for too long we 've had a president who has stood up and spoken out for the wealthy and the well-connected , but i do n't think that 's what americans need .  standing up for working people is about the american dream and about the democratic party ; standing up for the middle class is who we are and what we can be if we stick together .  eighty-nine percent of indiana voters said they have been affected by what they called a recession . clinton had a slight edge when voters were asked who is most likely to improve the economy -- taking 49 percent to obama 's 47 percent . the candidates now turn their attention to the upcoming contests in west virginia , kentucky and oregon . according to early exit polls , half of clinton 's supporters in indiana would not vote for obama in a general election matchup with sen. john mccain , the presumptive republican presidential nominee . watch what the exit polls show  a third of clinton voters said they would pick mccain over obama , while 17 percent said they would not vote at all . forty-eight percent of clinton supporters said they would back obama in november . obama got even less support from clinton backers in north carolina , where 45 percent of clinton supporters said they would vote for him over mccain . thirty-eight percent of clinton supporters said they would vote for mccain while 12 percent said they would not vote . obama voters appear to be more willing to support clinton in november . in indiana , 59 percent of obama backers said they 'd vote for clinton , and 70 percent of obama backers in north carolina said vote for her against mccain . obama on tuesday said he did n't agree with those who said his party would not be able to unite .  tonight , many of the pundits have suggested that this party is inalterably divided -- that sen. clinton 's supporters will not support me , and that my supporters will not support her ,  he said .  i 'm here tonight to tell you that i do n't believe it . yes , there have been bruised feelings on both sides . yes , each side desperately wants their candidate to win . but ultimately , this race is not about hillary clinton or barack obama or john mccain .  this election is about you -- the american people -- and whether we will have a president and a party that can lead us toward a brighter future .  obama currently leads in pledged delegates and in states won , and he is ahead in the popular vote , if florida and michigan are not factored into the equation . those states are being penalized for moving their primaries up in violation of party rules . with neither candidate expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to clinch the democratic nomination by june 3 , the end of the primary season , the final decision will most likely fall to the 796 superdelegates : democratic governors , members of congress and party officials . watch how superdelegates could come into play  both candidates have spent the past two weeks shuttling between indiana and north carolina , each arguing to crucial working-class voters that their rival is out of touch when it comes to the pocketbook issues that are dominating the campaign . cnn 's susan candiotti , dan lothian and paul steinhauser contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
