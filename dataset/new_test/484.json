{"text": "if you 're like us , you eat out more than ever -- and , as nice as it is to not have to cook , those meals out can actually feel like work . how do you navigate the minefields of huge portions , hidden fats , and sky-high sodium levels ? olive garden 's venetian apricot chicken has 448 calories and 11 grams of fat . you should n't have to resign yourself to paying for restaurant meals with a future cardiac risk . you just need to know where to go to find healthy , fresh food . to that end , we went out into the world of sit-down restaurants , looking to separate the -lrb- whole -rrb- wheat from the chaff . backed by an advisory panel of experts in healthy dining , we sifted through 43 chains with more than 75 locations across the country and , frankly , were astonished by how many restaurants made no nutritional information available . health.com : meet health 's experts . but judge we did those brave -lrb- and progressive -rrb- enough to share their numbers . what you hold in your hands are the 10 that stood at the top of the heap . uno 's chicago grill . if you have n't been to your local uno 's recently , you 're in for a great surprise . sure , its famous deep-dish -lrb- read high-fat -rrb- pizzas still hold court , but nutrition has become the word of the day with a completely transfat-free menu and plenty of grilled entrees -lrb- including antibiotic-free chicken -rrb- . adding to the healthy variety : whole-grain pasta and brown rice , organic coffee and tea , and flatbread pizzas that have half the calories of deep-dish ones . plus , you can add a salad to your pizza for half-price because , according to the menu ,  we want you to get some greens in your diet .  now that 's a blue-ribbon commitment to health . another reason uno 's is at the top of our list : you know what you 're eating . in the lobbies of most of the restaurant 's locations , there are nutrition information centers that detail ingredients , fat and sodium contents , and calories and fiber of every item , in addition to gluten-free options . dr. sanjay gupta takes a look at health magazine 's restaurant choices  • danger zone : deep-dish pizzas can pile on the fat . • we love : the penne bolognese -- just 16 grams of fat -lrb- well within the daily recommended max of 65 grams of fat for a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet -rrb- . souplantation & sweet tomatoes . can a buffet-style restaurant -- that symbol of american overindulgence -- possibly be one of the healthiest restaurants in the country ? it can in this case , because this salad-soup-and-bakery eatery -lrb- southern california locations are named souplantation , everywhere else they 're called sweet tomatoes -rrb- uses produce so fresh that it 's guaranteed to have been  in the ground  24 hours before it 's in a refrigerated truck on its way to the restaurant . at the salad bar you 'll find seasonal vegetables like squash and bell peppers , freshly tossed and prepared salads , and a great range of nonfat dressings . san marino spinach with pumpkin seeds and cranberries , anyone ? this is paradise for vegetarians , vegans , and anyone who 's looking for a low-sodium , low-fat , high-nutrient meal outside the home . • danger zone : plate overload -- after all , it 's all-you-can-eat . • we love : the tomato spinach whole wheat pasta , a delicious combo of whole grains and veggies . mimi 's cafe . this cozy café-style restaurant transforms normally less-than-healthy foods into better -- and still tasty -- options : a half-pound cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce -lrb- that 's right , no bun -rrb- ; the cutely named naked french market onion soup , served without cheese . another thing to love is the way that mimi 's clearly steers you toward its healthy options . its  lifestyle menu  points you to low-carb picks like the fish of the day served with fresh steamed veggies . also , mimi 's keeps portions small , so you can get away with occasionally having one of their more indulgent entrees like the sweet & sour coconut shrimp -lrb- 608 calories -rrb- . health.com : healthiest fast-food restaurants . • danger zone : the  comfort classics  page of the menu , with throwbacks like rich -lrb- super-high-fat -rrb- chicken cordon bleu . • we love : chicken & fruit -- grilled chicken and a garden salad , plus wedges of fresh orange , honeydew , watermelon , and cantaloupe . p.f. chang 's china bistro . take the best aspects of asian cuisine -- a combination of fresh vegetables and protein -- surround them with healthy influences such as whole-grain brown rice , wild-caught , sustainable alaskan salmon , and all-natural chicken , and you have a recipe for delicious , healthy dining . wok-based cooking -lrb- which requires less oil -rrb- using soybean oil keeps fat contents low , and less sodium in the sauces rounds out p.f. chang 's healthy take on chinese food . special credit goes to their nutritional information being based on the whole entrée , not a single serving like at most places . health.com : eat out , without gaining a pound . • danger zone : traditional , fat-dense items such as lo mein beef . • we love : carb-free vegetarian lettuce wraps -- wok-seared tofu , red onions , and water chestnuts with mint and lime , set in lettuce cups . bob evans restaurants . you would n't think a restaurant that prides itself on sausage could muscle its way into the top five healthiest restaurants in the country . but bob evans scores high on its dinner menu , which has plenty of low-carb , low-fat entrees and alternatives for children and adults -lrb- chicken tenders that are grilled instead of fried , potato-crusted flounder , and salmon stir-fry -rrb- . look for sides like steamed broccoli florets and fresh fruit , and enjoy old-fashioned family meals in a modern , nutrition-forward way . • danger zone : breakfast , where bacon and sausage are kings . • we love : healthy options on the kid 's menu , like slow-roasted turkey with mashed potatoes and glazed baby carrots , and fruit and yogurt dippers for dessert . ruby tuesday . if we 'd done this survey in 2004 , ruby tuesday might have won the blue ribbon for printing all its nutritional content right on the menu . it was revolutionary , and , frankly , it did n't last . but the healthy ethos survived in the chain 's ingredients : organic greens , hormone-free chicken , transfat-free frying oil , and better-for-you beverages including jones organic teas and made-to-order drinks like all natural lemonades -lrb- think real fruit and juice -rrb- . it 's easy to find the good stuff -- it 's highlighted -- and the offerings range from a chicken wrap in a whole-wheat tortilla to broiled tilapia . health.com : the best independent restaurants . • danger zone : comfort-food entrees like gourmet chicken potpie , which piles more than half your daily calories on the plate . • we love : that they 've even healthied-up the burgers , offering veggie-and turkey-versions . romano 's macaroni grill . this italian eatery puts its entire menu 's nutritional content online , so you know before you go what to steer clear of -- mainly , the massive baked pastas . but what pushed macaroni grill onto our best list is its  sensible fare  menu , with entrees like simple salmon , a grilled fillet sided by grilled asparagus and broccoli . grazie for whole-wheat penne available as a substitute in any dish . and bravo for including a grilled skinless chicken breast with steamed broccoli and pasta on the kid 's menu . • danger zone : heavy entrees like spaghetti and meatballs with meat sauce . • we love : the delicious italian sorbetto and biscotti : just 330 calories and 4 grams of fat . chevy 's fresh mex . chevy 's makes a big deal out of the  fresh  in its name , and with good reason -- no cans in the restaurant , fresh salsa blended every hour , fresh avocados smashed every day for guacamole , and watch-them-made tortillas . all oils are trans fat-free , and the mexican-style fare has lots of healthy options including grilled fish tacos . health.com : america 's not-so-healthiest restaurants . • danger zone : sodium counts . to get below 1,000 milligrams , you 'll need to get those chicken fajitas with no tortillas , tomalito , rice , sour cream , or guacamole . • we love : fresh fish of the day , grilled and served on a skillet with homemade salsa . olive garden . like macaroni grill , this italian eatery has great-for-you options , as long as you keep your wits about you -lrb- again , avoid the baked pastas ! -rrb- . use the olive-branch icon on the menu to find low-fat  garden fare  items such as venetian apricot chicken . even the fries are n't a disaster , because they 're done in trans fat-free oil . you can grab some whole-grain goodness , too , by choosing the whole-wheat linguine at dinner as a substitute for any pasta . • danger zone : the non-olive-branch entrees . olive garden provides no nutritional information on anything else on the menu . • we love : the low-fat capellini pomodoro -lrb- 644 calories and 14 grams fat -rrb- . denny 's . yes , the home of the lumberjack slam and moons over my hammy offers lots of skinny options to counter its fatty mainstays .  fit-fare  dishes such as the grilled-chicken-breast salad , and tilapia with rice and veggies , each have less than 15 grams of fat . denny 's also posts full nutritional information on its web site . its use of trans fats to cook its french fries kept it from landing higher on our list , but the rest of the fried food is trans fat-free . • danger zone : breakfast specials , especially the meat lover 's scramble , which is as bad for you as it sounds . • we love : the online nutritional chart has
