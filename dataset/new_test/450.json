{"text": "some democrats say they fear their party 's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic as neither presidential candidate is likely to gather the delegates needed for the nomination . the democrats ' superdelegate system is supposed to avoid turmoil at the party 's conventions . sens. hillary clinton and barack obama are running neck and neck toward the party 's august convention in denver , colorado . most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then . party rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers , elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance . the party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention . but even some superdelegates are questioning the system , as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome .  it 's not the most democratic way of doing things ,  said maine superdelegate sam spencer . watch the scenario for a  civil war  in the democratic party  at least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses . moveon.org , which has endorsed obama , is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in usa today . and democracy for america , headed by democratic national committee chairman howard dean 's brother jim , said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates . while pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they 'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus , superdelegates are free to vote however they want . and even if they pledge their support to a candidate , they 're free to change at any time . clinton already has 234 superdelegates and obama has 157 . but obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates , 1,096 to 977 , and is on a roll , having won all eight nominating contests since super tuesday . see which states pledged delegates come from  if the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote , the turmoil would last long beyond the convention , longtime democratic party strategist tad devine said .  if a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses , but by politicians in some mythical backroom , i think that the public could react strongly against that ,  devine said .  the problem is -lsb- if -rsb- people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead , insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process , particularly the young people who are voting for the first time , will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated ,  he said . superdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate democrats back to conventions , where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s , and to relect the party 's mainstream more accurately .  -lsb- superdelegates -rsb- are the keepers of the faith ,  said former san francisco , california , mayor willie brown .  you have superdelegates because this is the democratic party . you do n't want the bleed-over from the green party , the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be .  devine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former vice president walter mondale in 1984 . mondale 's 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former sen. gary hart and jesse jackson . mondale had received more votes , but hart had won more states . mondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor . each campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side . jason rae , a 21-year-old wisconsin superdelegate , said he 's gotten calls from former president clinton and former secretary of state madeleine albright from hillary clinton 's camp , and obama 's wife , michelle , visited with him during a campaign stop tuesday in wisconsin . rae said he has n't yet decided how he 'll vote in wisconsin 's primary on tuesday . crystal strait , a party activist from california , said she 's received calls from clinton herself and daughter chelsea but she remains uncommitted . massachusetts superdelegate john walsh said he 'll stay loyal to obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in walsh 's state . so will fellow massachusetts superdelegates sens. edward kennedy and john kerry . among clinton 's committed superdelegates are harold ickes jr. , her husband 's former deputy chief of staff ; terry mcauliffe , who led her husband 's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign ; and her husband . whether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates , even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote , could split the party .  it 's in a total contradiction of the way the democrats have set up their primary process , with all this proportional representation ,  said cnn political analyst amy holmes .  the whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites . and if this is decided by superdelegates , i think the democratic party morally is going to be looking at each other and say , ` what did we just do ? '  devine said it could hurt the party in the general election .  i think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we 're saying we will pursue in government as democrats are based on fairness , whether it 's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance , there 's a fairness component in all of that ,  he said .  people need to believe , i think , that our process is fair as well , if they want to believe that our policies will be fair .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's campbell brown , john helton and ed hornick contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
