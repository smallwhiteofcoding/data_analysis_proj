{"text": "london , england fantasy author terry pratchett has admitted that he has been diagnosed with a rare form of alzheimer 's disease -- but says he plans to continue writing his multi-million selling discworld books . terry pratchett , whose books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide in 33 languages . pratchett , 59 -- whose books have , according to his web site , sold more than 45 million copies worldwide in 33 languages -- suffered what he called a  phantom stroke  earlier this year . in a statement titled  an embuggerance  on the web site of discworld illustrator paul kidby , pratchett says that he has been diagnosed with what he terms  a very rare form of early onset alzheimer 's .   i would have liked to keep this one quiet for a little while , but because of upcoming conventions and of course the need to keep my publishers informed , it seems to me unfair to withhold the news ,  says pratchett , who has a strong following among fans of fantasy fiction .  all other things being equal , i expect to meet most current and , as far as possible , future commitments but will discuss things with the various organisers ,  he continues .  frankly , i would prefer it if people kept things cheerful , because i think there 's time for at least a few more books yet .  pratchett adds that work is continuing on his next book  nation  and that the  basic notes are already being laid down for unseen academicals .  in a p.s. he adds that  i would just like to draw attention to everyone reading the above that this should be interpreted as ' i am not dead ' . i will , of course , be dead at some future point , as will everybody else .  i know it 's a very human thing to say ` is there anything i can do ' , but in this case i would only entertain offers from very high-end experts in brain chemistry .  pratchett 's discworld novels , of which 36 have been published to date , are set in a fantasy universe through which the author satirizes modern-day life . he says in a statement on his own web site that the series  started out as a parody of all the fantasy that was around in the big boom of the early '80s , then turned into a satire on just about everything , and even i do n't know what it is now .  pratchett , who began writing while a provincial newspaper journalist in the 1960s , received the order of the british empire  for services to literature  from the prince of wales in 1998 . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
