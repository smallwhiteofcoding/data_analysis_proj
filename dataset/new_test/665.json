{"text": "china 's economy is booming and sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum 's visit there this week highlights the u.a.e. 's ambitions to join in on this growth . cnn 's john defterios -lrb- jd -rrb- sits down with shaukat aziz -lrb- sa -rrb- , former prime minister to pakistan to talk about the emerging relationship . former pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz . aziz is an expert in global banking who worked in the middle east for a number of years as an official for citigroup . he was an influential player in the process of creating a free trade agreement between pakistan and china , after visiting the country in 2005 . shaukat aziz talks about the growing ties between china and the middle east , and gives us inside knowledge on doing business in china . -lrb- sa -rrb- : i think the two economies are complementary . china is a global economy which is growing rapidly . it has one of the highest growth rates in the world , and it is expanding its footprint all over the world . dubai and the u.a.e. is clearly a hub for south asia , the middle east , and the whole region . they are a trading center , they are a financial center , and they do n't compete directly with china , in fact both economies will compliment each other . i think the u.a.e. prime minister 's trip will help to further reinforce this and get the two countries closer together , in trade , in financial flows , in linking capital markets and many other initiatives . -lrb- jd -rrb- : trade has been growing 30 to 40 percent over the last four years . but can it move beyond hard chinese goods going into the gulf ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : of course it can . i think the nature of dubai is such that it has now become the clearing house for goods from all over the world . and buyers go to dubai and look for the best product at the best price . so , if china , being a large country , can bring its products to dubai , it will help both countries . may i also say that i see china evolving as an exporter of capital , not just goods because china is running huge surpluses . their reserves are at an all time high . so they are looking for investments too , and you see now a trend in chinese companies to buy companies overseas . a trend in chinese companies to invest overseas because they want , once they go global , they want production facilities all over the world . so the design and the research and development will be done in china , the components will come from china , but the manufacturing could move across the world . this trend is already started and i think this will all go well for both countries . -lrb- jd -rrb- : lets take it a step further . do you see chinese investment funds or sovereign funds and u.a.e. sovereign funds going out together to acquire companies in the near future ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : sure , there have been situations where both have participated in different companies . -lrb- jd -rrb- : but separately . -lrb- sa -rrb- : separately , but i think they could join too . but the real issue on sovereign funds is being represented in certain quarters as if this is something which is unhelpful to the global economy . in my view , in an era of globalization we must open up our markets for investments and let anybody come along in line with the rules of that country . may i say that the sovereignty of any country is a very robust concept . and if a foreign sovereign fund or investor comes along and buys a bank in a particular country , the countries sovereignty is never jeopardized . but , if you have good regulators and good policies , because even in a deregulated environment , regulation is necessary . deregulation does not mean abdication by the government , so if your regulatory regime is sound , you do n't have to worry . sovereign funds have demonstrated that they have helped promote economic activity , help save certain companies , banks as a case in point . and it 's a win-win for both sides . so i think this question of their role is over stated . -lrb- jd -rrb- : saudi arabia 's king abdullah went to visit china when he came into power in early 2006 . is itinevitable that u.s.-european allies in the gulf turn to the east now and look for new partnerships in an east-east equation ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : this is the fastest growing economy in the world . it is absorbing foreign investment , it is exporting investment . it is the largest producer of goods and services now , in terms of growth rate . so saudi arabia , naturally , the largest economy in the middle east by a long margin , needs to link up a country like china . i think it is not geo-politics which is driving it . it is economic necessity . it is tapping into growth . saudi companies are investing in china . i know that in the energy sector aramco has gone in for joint ventures and maybe sabic too , and that is to me a very positive development . because it is showing that capital looks for opportunities and if there is return china is not far enough . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
