{"text": "washington there is  no remaining hope  of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a utah coal mine alive , a federal official said saturday . isaac arellano holds a candle and sings during a fundraiser for miners tuesday in price , utah .  over the past 25 days , the mine safety and health administration has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners ,  richard stickler , head of the agency , said in a statement .  the thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at msha are with the families .  sympathy for the failed efforts also came saturday from the white house .  last night , a difficult decision was made to end the search ,  president bush said in a statement .  laura and i are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men .  labor secretary elaine chao called the ordeal  heartbreaking .   the grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community , and our thoughts and prayers are with them all ,  chao said in a statement . after drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above , there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no sound from the men . see a timeline of rescue efforts  tests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life .  we basically told the families that at this point in time we 've run out of options ,  stickler said at a news conference late friday .  we 've consulted with the people that we have here , we 've consulted with the technical support in pittsburgh and we 've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go ,  he said .  and basically , through all the information we 've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found , in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else , we just do n't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information .  see photos of the rescue mission  there were no public statements saturday from bob murray , president and ceo of murray mining , co-owner of the crandall canyon mine , who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks , then largely disappeared from public view . federal officials became the spokesmen . no one from murray mining was present at friday 's news conference .  they are done . it 's finished ,  the attorney for the families said , according to the saturday edition of the salt lake tribune .  it 's a hard and bitter pill for our families , and there were quite a few tears shed ,  the newspaper quotes colin king as saying . the men were trapped during a collapse on august 6 , and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in . efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed , and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working . murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole . under pressure from the families , however , he agreed to try one more time . families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule . the effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called  a long shot  by an official . msha 's stickler said that hole was drilled into the crandall canyon mine on thursday , but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it . work resumed friday , this time at the fourth hole , but the camera could only descend about 7 feet , he said .  basically , what it saw was really not that much . there was quite a bit of mud in there , water coming down the hole . it really could n't go any farther than seven feet ,  he said of the latest try . in addition , the roof was sagging .  the families asked many , many questions and we answered them all the best we could , basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options .  murray said last saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the crandall canyon mine .  i will never come back to that evil mountain ,  he said . friends and family have identified the six missing miners as luis hernandez , manuel sanchez , kerry allred , carlos payan , brandon phillips and don erickson . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
