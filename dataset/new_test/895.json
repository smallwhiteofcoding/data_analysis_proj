{"text": "the shoe phone on tv 's  get smart  was n't just a sneaky spy gadget , it was a technological marvel : a wireless , portable telephone that could be used anywhere -- though it did require a dime to make a call . today , almost everyone has a pocket-sized version that also takes photos , shoots video , sends e-mail and surfs the internet . about the only thing it does n't do is protect your feet .  get smart  comes to the big screen next week , along with a spate of new spy gadgets to help maxwell smart , agent 99 and the other spies at control . the gadgets are just as goofy as they were in the original tv series , but because technology has caught up with the writers ' imaginations , there 's a big difference : many of the movie 's doo-dads actually exist .  our favorite thing is to take something that does sort of exist and just exaggerate it a little bit ,  said matt ember , who co-wrote the script . the film shows a tiny ipod alongside spy-worthy stuff such as a two-way tooth radio and a digital  spy fly  -- all of which are available now .  it 's pushed to a level of success that perhaps it has n't achieved in the real world , but it 's real , it 's out there , so that 's fun  added co-writer tom j. astle , a self-described science nut . director peter segal said he originally could n't believe such devices were real .  i said , ` that 's too silly . i do n't think people will buy it ,  ' he recalled telling the writers .  then they googled it and it came up as an actual thing .  astle and ember saw the tooth radio in a magazine and thought it was a perfect fit for the film .  that 's an example of taking inspiration from the old series in spirit ,  astle said .  the inherent comedy of having a microphone in your mouth -- it 's really close to your voice and it 's easy to yell and be too loud .  the inextricable link between gadgets and spy movies began with james bond in 1962 , said tv historian tim brooks , author of  the complete directory to prime time network and cable tv shows .  the often-preposterous devices bond used added levity to a genre that  had always been deadly serious  during the early years of the cold war , brooks said . back in the day ,  get smart  ratcheted up the goofiness level with bulletproof pajamas , a bunsen-burner phone and other wacky gadgets that often did n't work . when the show debuted in 1965 , the nation was future-focused and obsessed with the promise of technology . the show played on that obsession , brooks said , introducing dozens of covert gadgets and props designed to make life easier for cold war-era secret agents . a cigarette lighter doubled as a .22 - caliber gun . a lipstick could record conversations or release poisonous gas . then there was the famous shoe phone and the always-dysfunctional  cone of silence  that could -lrb- theoretically -rrb- keep conversations private , even in a crowded room .  it 's nothing that you would expect to find or would even make sense in real life , and that 's the gag ,  brooks said .  it was part of what the show was about . you 'd watch wondering what 's next , where 's the phone going to be next time . ... it was like a satire of our fixation with gadgets .  the movie also takes liberties with some familiar devices , such as portable lasers , retinal scanners and a tricked-out swiss army knife equipped with a flame-thrower and a mini crossbow . despite living in a high-tech world , movie fans still love spy gadgets , the filmmakers said : just look at the success of the bond franchise , which will soon introduce its 22nd installment , and spy spoofs such as  austin powers .  part of it is the undercover element , part of it is a cultural love for technology , and part of it is wishful thinking .  human beings are tool-users ,  astle said .  we would like to believe that our government -- the good guys -- have within their power tools and electronic gadgets that will protect us that are beyond what we could do .   there is some reality to it ,  ember said .  we do have facial-recognition software , but on the other hand , i 'm not allowed to bring shampoo on an airplane .
