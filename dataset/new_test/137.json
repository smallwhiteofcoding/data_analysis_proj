{"text": "if you thought it was difficult managing your own money in 2007 , consider the pressure of the task when you 're dealing with $ 1.8 trillion of client assets . sallie krawcheck has made fortune 's list of the world 's most powerful women every year since 2002 . that 's what sallie krawcheck does as chairman and chief executive of citi global wealth management . she joined the banking industry as a research analyst , but quickly rose through the ranks , gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way . dubbed the  mrs clean  of wall street , ms krawcheck was credited with restoring investors ' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm smith barney . she joined citigroup in 2002 , and spent some time as chief financial officer before taking up her current role in march 2007 . sallie krawcheck has been a regular entrant on fortune 's list of the world 's most powerful women in business -- in 2007 , she made number 12 . john defterios caught up with ms krawcheck in dubai . he asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the g8 -lrb- canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states -rrb- . sallie krawcheck -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think what 's happening right now , it 's fascinating because in the united states and in developed europe we 're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis . and in fact , we are awash with liquidity in the middle east and in asia as well , so there 's really a bifurcation that 's occurring in the world . and if you think about , oil does n't even have to stay at the 90-plus dollar level it is ; even at levels in the 70 's , 60 's , 50 's , 40 's , a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market . yes , the investments are going up globally , but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region . and so over time , you 're really going to see ... i think continue to see ... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the middle east as well as to asia . john defterios -lrb- jd -rrb- : it 's coming almost as a perfect storm ; we have a sub prime crisis , a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years . in this window of time , is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of wall street and it undermines its role ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think there is no doubt that new york is losing its status as a financial capital of the world . if you think about some years ago , if you think about the internet bubble for example , where it was new york and california was n't it ? and you look at a whole range of reasons for it , and the sub prime crisis perhaps , the decline of the dollar perhaps . but you have overlapping regulators in the united states , you have very high taxes in the united states , you have a very litigious environment in the united states , and you have the emerging markets coming up , so capital is being raised outside of the united states . these things , some of which are negative for the united states , some of which are positive for the other regions , is accelerating a shift that was underway from new york , to london , to hong kong , to singapore , and potentially to dubai as well . -lrb- jd -rrb- : some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both wall street and capitol hill in washington . you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . you ca n't say i want some of that liquidity but i only want part of that liquidity . what is the result of that do you think ? can you over-regulate the sovereign funds ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : oh , i think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds . i think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well ; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of ` here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity ' . and the concern is if , gee these are going to be important going forward , we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets , but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the united states or europe for example . -lrb- jd -rrb- : it 's fascinating because if you look at qatar or egypt or shanghai , the stock markets have almost had like a one way path ; there 's been some correction here in the middle east . but what are we likely to see here , stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way , or an implosion because of the rapid gains ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think you 've got to separate the idea of what 's going on in the real economies and what 's going on in the market places . they move together , but sometimes they separate , they diverge , and they can diverge for a long period of time . if you look at economic growth potential of the middle east , of asia , of latin america , we feel very bullish about this . and i was making the point earlier today , china has been growing at 11 or 12 percent , not for one year or two years , but literally for 30 years . for 30 years it 's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see . so , say the same thing for the middle east , the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant , but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward . -lrb- jd -rrb- : is wall street , or for that matter , london or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case , 1.4 trillion dollars of assets ... -lrb- sk -rrb- : 1.8 thank you ... -lrb- jd -rrb- : ... to run one of the major money center banks of the world ? i 'm sure you 're feeling this pressure even though you 're young by international standards . are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : well it looks like the united states may be ready for a woman to take over as president . so i think if we 're ready to potentially have a woman run the country , i think we are getting ready as a country , to potentially have a woman run a money center bank . now , you know , the board would n't ask and i would n't accept , but if you look across wall street , there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are ceo 's who move along , and i think it 's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country . have your say . email us at mme@cnn.com, or send an i-report . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
