{"text": "new york for years , russian arms dealer viktor bout made millions of dollars delivering weapons and ammunition to warlords and militants , officials say . on thursday , bout and his associate , andrew smulian , were arrested in thailand after a series of events that officials said could have come straight out of a spy novel . the men 's capture involved law enforcement agencies from at least five countries , including two undercover agents from the u.s. drug enforcement administration posing as colombian rebels . bout and smulian are accused of conspiracy to provide surface-to-air missiles and other weapons to colombian rebels , said michael garcia , u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york . in a complaint filed by a dea agent , they are said to have conspired to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , or farc . the u.s. department of state designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 2003 .  this marks the end of the reign of one of the world 's most-wanted arms traffickers ,  garcia said of bout .  someone will undoubtedly write a book about this case someday , and i can tell you that it will read like the very best work of tom clancy , only in this case , it wo n't be fiction ,  said michael braun , assistant administrator and chief of operations for the dea . secret meetings . the operation began in january , when smulian began meeting with two men who claimed to represent farc but who were actually confidential sources working for the dea . the men expressed interest in buying millions of dollars worth of weapons . at meetings in the netherlands antilles , denmark and romania , smulian discussed the details and logistics of the arms deal with the two agents . at one meeting , the agents were given a digital memory stick containing an article about bout and documents containing photos and specifications for 100 surface-to-air missiles and armor-piercing rocket launchers . smulian explained that a delivery system was in place that would allow the weapons to be air-dropped into colombia , and he told the men that it would cost $ 5 million to transport the weapons . during one meeting , smulian introduced the dea sources to bout over the phone . after that conversation , smulian told one of the sources that the weapons were ready in bulgaria . smulian and bout set up a face-to-face meeting with them to finalize the deal , and that is what happened thursday . the arrests were made thursday afternoon . the charges against bout and smulian cover the period from november through february , according to a written statement from the u.s. attorney 's office and the dea . the united states plans to pursue the extradition of bout from thailand , the statement said . there was no mention of smulian 's fate . bout and smulian are charged with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . if convicted , each could get a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison , the statement said . ` i 'm not a diamond guy ' intelligence agencies around the world have tracked bout for years . although some of his work has been legitimate , most has not . he has made deliveries to africa , asia and the mideast using obsolete or surplus soviet-era cargo planes . bout , a former soviet air force officer who speaks multiple languages , has what is reputed to be the largest private fleet of soviet-era cargo aircraft in the world , according to u.s. officials . he acquired the planes shortly after the breakup of the soviet union , the u.s. department of the treasury said in 2005 . at that time , the u.s. treasury announced that it was freezing the assets of bout and his associates , who are all tied to former liberian president charles taylor . taylor is being tried on war crimes charges by the special court for sierra leone . intelligence officials said bout shipped large quantities of small arms to civil wars across africa and asia , often taking diamonds in payment from west african fighters . a 2006 article in foreign policy magazine said that although bout served many third-world leaders , he also aided organizations such as the united nations .  he made countless trips for the united nations into the same areas where he supplied the weapons that sparked the humanitarian crises in the first place ,  the article charged . it said bout probably committed multiple violations of u.n. arms embargoes . british intelligence officials found evidence in afghanistan that bout had shipped arms to the taliban and al qaeda , as well as circumstantial evidence that he shipped weapons technology into iraq . and the u.s. government said it received information that bout profited $ 50 million from supplying the taliban with military equipment when they ruled afghanistan . bout , who is said to be the inspiration for nicolas cage 's arms dealer character in the movie  lord of war ,  told cnn in 2002 that he never sold arms to the taliban or al qaeda . he also denied providing weapons and missile-guidance technology to iraq . bout said that his air transport company is legitimate and that he ferried a variety of cargo to africa and to afghanistan since 1992 . he denied that any of it was done illegally or that he was paid in  blood diamonds  from africa .  it 's a lie ,  he said .  i never touched diamonds in my life , and i 'm not a diamond guy , and i do n't want to go into that business .  some reports at the time claimed that bout flew into afghanistan just before september 11 , 2001 . but bout told cnn that the last time he was in afghanistan was 1996 and that he never met terror mastermind osama bin laden . e-mail
