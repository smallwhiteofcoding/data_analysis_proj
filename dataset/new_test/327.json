{"text": "atlanta falcons quarterback michael vick is expected to plead guilty to federal conspiracy charges involving an illegal dogfighting operation , according to one of his attorneys . leah perry , who sent this photo of son bobby and dog rosie , thinks vick should not be allowed back on the field . the plea deal may include prison time , but the nfl has not yet decided what football sanctions , if any , it should impose on vick , a spokesman said . we asked cnn.com readers whether they thought vick would -- or should -- play professional football again as well as their opinions on the case . below is a selection of those responses , some of which have been edited for length and clarity . stephanie king of arlington , washington michael vick is a disgrace . for anyone thinking he should be let off easy for admitting his guilt -- think again . the only reason he did that was because he knew the evidence against him was so great . remember only shortly ago he was stating vehemently that he  only owned  the property and had no idea what was going on there . it was n't until the eyewitness accounts were brought to light that he  apologized .  one can not be  sorry  for torturing and killing animals . as you know it 's been proven that those with the ability to do so also have a stronger chance of being abusive to humans . how can we allow someone like that to be a role model for children ? if we do we 're degrading our society and shame on us . patricia reese of paola , kansas yes , i think mr. vick should be allowed to play football again . he is a talented individual and it would be a shame to waste that talent . i also believe he should be able to rebuild his life . however , as part of his restitution to society , i believe he should contribute at least 40 % of his salary for what could have potentially been his maximum jail sentence to the humane society to help abused and abandoned animals . debbie clayton of greensboro , north carolina he should never be allowed to play -lsb- in the -rsb- nfl or earn a dime associated with the nfl . he should be made to work so many hours per week , every week , at minimum wage at an animal shelter . jeff wise of atlanta , georgia why not give him a chance to play again ? seriously how many chances has the nfl given to ricky williams ? smoking pot is against the law , but he 's been given a number of chances , and still is n't banned from the nfl ! jeremy montgomery of mount laurel , new jersey i think that vick should not be allowed to step on the field again and any endorsement deals revoked . what he did was reprehensible . he is in a spotlight where he should be held at a higher standard for a role model . josh hebert of loganville , georgia he should take whatever punishment our government gives him , but when he has done his time -lrb- if he does do time -rrb- he should be able to continue playing football . the charges against him are not football related in any way . angela ziegler of cleveland , ohio the nfl needs to  step up to the plate  and be the man that michael vick is not . allowing him in their league gives a signal that animal abuse is ok with them . remember jeffrey dahmer started as an animal abuser ! want him as your role model or a spokesman ? kelly koch of holland , michigan the nfl and all sponsors should refrain from any future contact with michael vick . i , for one , will boycott those with future dealings with him . john robinson of redmond , washington pro athletes are constantly getting in trouble with the law . unless we make a policy that all players who are convicted of a felony are banned from the league , then vick should be allowed to play after a suspension . randy jonson of stamford , connecticut until i know the depth of the gambling angle it 's hard to be certain . dog fighting is brutal but if it 's only dog fighting/killing , he should get whatever the feds give him and be able to return to football once his debt is paid . bill saray of derby , connecticut vick should never play again . he was n't the best qb to begin with . anyone with such a blatant disregard for life -- animal or human -- is not worthy of the position in life he was given . playing in the nfl is not a right . as such , the league should ban him permanently , while society should shun him publicly . if only scarlet letters were still around . todd morrison of howell , michigan mr. vick should be judged of his crime . not by his fame , nor his race . he should be prosecuted as a person . i believe mr. vick 's nfl playing days should be determined by the nfl commissioner with consideration of the nfl 's personal conduct policy . this is how everyone should be treated in america . everyone is equal regardless of popularity , fame , and race . lance g. of dearborn heights , michigan first off , i am an african-american ... this is not a race issue . i wish the ignorant people here in the u.s. would get off that tip . this is not an issue to raise the  race  card . even his so-called homies -lrb- who were all black -rrb- turned on him . vick ... committed a felony and now he has to pay for it . he should have chosen a better hobby in life than dog fighting . as for playing football ... he should be banned from the league for at least 2 to 3 years , including his jail time . leah perry of chelmsford , massachusetts i do n't think vick should be allowed to play football , nor should he get off easy . after he serves his sentence , i think he should work at the mspca -lsb- to -rsb- make him see what cruelty to animals really looks like in all aspects . steven todd of fort wayne , indiana i think michael vick will play football again , though at what level is anybody 's guess . i do not think he should be banned for life . he may have gambled , but not on the game as pete rose did . a suspension is in order and i think a year would be fair , but a prison term and suspension would put him out of football for up to three years , and who knows what kind of qb he will be after this ordeal and so long an absence ? jennifer runyan of fayetteville , north carolina i think the whole michael vick case is disgusting . the nfl needs to ban him permanently . he should n't be able to use the obscene amount of money he makes to torture innocent animals . kids looked up to him and how many of them will think that abuse is ok now ? i do n't think he deserves to play ever again . i applaud the people sending michael vick jerseys into the atlanta humane society to use cleaning the kennels , now that 's appropriate ! watch what a dog thinks of his vick jersey . debbie connor of whitesville , kentucky no , he should not be granted the right to play pro football again ! he was given the  golden  key to a life of fame and riches and he blew it away . he should be working for the road department , picking up  road kill  off the streets ! julio hernandez of kalamazoo , michigan he needs to be banned from the nfl forever . these  men  are role models for the youth of this country . what kind of message would we be sending to them if we were to let him play in the nfl again ? not a good one , i can tell you that much . he 's through . and if he 's not , i certainly wo n't be watching any falcons games , or for that matter any team he may eventually play for . nichelle williams of woodbridge , virginia if imus is going to return back to the air ... then vick should return to the field . you violate some people or beings ; you apologize , let the air clear and go on with business as usual ! john brandon of old hickory , tennessee to make a long story short -- my family will never watch a game with michael vick in attendance . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
