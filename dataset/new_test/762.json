{"text": "washington senate republicans on tuesday blocked a democratic initiative that would have taxed the windfall profits oil companies have enjoyed due to rising energy prices , with the minority leader calling the proposal a  gimmick .  record energy prices have led to record profits for oil companies . the measure failed to achieve the 60 votes required by senate rules to proceed . the vote was 51-43 . six republicans , including three seeking re-election in november , broke ranks to support the bill . two democrats -- sen. mary landrieu of oil-producing state louisiana and majority leader harry reid , who voted no to be able to bring the measure back to the floor under senate rules -- voted against the measure . along with placing a special tax of 25 percent on oil companies , the bill would have permitted lawsuits against the organization of petroleum exporting countries , the oil-producing cartel , and suspended deposits into the strategic petroleum reserve . profits from renewable energy sources would be excluded from the tax .  we 're not afraid , on this side , to go after big oil when they are not doing the right thing ,  said sen. charles schumer , d-new york .  and we are not afraid to go after opec because they are a cartel that squeezes us .  we 're not afraid to do some strong tough things that will -- some in the short run , some in the longer run -- that will bring down the price , the all too high price , of gasoline .  sen. byron dorgan , d-north dakota , said the measure was needed to  wring out  speculators he blamed for driving the price of crude oil to more than $ 130 a barrel in recent weeks . but senate republicans insisted the new taxes ultimately would hurt consumers and cut american oil supply , saying democrats simply were playing election-year politics . the bill is  pure and simple a pathetic attempt to even call itself an energy plan ,  said sen. kay bailey hutchison , r-texas . senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said ,  hitting the gas companies might make for good campaign literature or evening news clips , but it wo n't address the problem . this bill is n't a serious response to gas prices . it is just a gimmick .  the kentucky republican added ,  they are hoping the idea of going after energy companies will create the illusion of action after a week in which they themselves fought for a bill that would make the problem worse . what a political charade .  as the average cost of gas edged above $ 4 a gallon , high prices are definitely on the minds of voters . a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released tuesday shows 40 percent of respondents are more concerned about the cost of gasoline than long lines at the pump , which occurred during the energy crisis of the 1970s . but 55 percent of those surveyed are more worried about the long lines and rationing . the poll results reflect telephone interviews with 1,035 adults on wednesday and thursday . the margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points . cnn 's ted barrett , lisa desjardins , matt smith , virginia nicolaidis and scott j. anderson contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
