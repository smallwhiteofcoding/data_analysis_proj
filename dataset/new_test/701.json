{"text": "in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . keith oppenheim is covering the controversy in irving , texas over authorities ' efforts to find illegal immigrants . irving , texas -- i certainly do n't think i look like a cop . with a blue blazer , and scruffy khakis i take into the field , i have that look of a reporter who 's trying to dress up just enough to be professional , but no more . protesters in irving , texas , demonstrate against a program that checks the immigration status of anyone arrested . so , it came as a surprise to me when i learned some latino men , day laborers who were standing around and hoping to get some work , thought i was a federal immigration officer .  you thought i was from immigration ?  i asked one .  si  , the man replied . my producer , patricia pedraza , translated the rest .  the fear is with both immigration and the police . now you can not trust absolutely anybody .  in irving , texas , a dallas suburb of about 200,000 people , right next to the big airport , an estimated 40 percent of the city is latino , and anecdotally , we 're told there are a lot of undocumented workers here , people who are in the u.s. illegally , but clearly do n't view themselves as criminals .  they take innocent people , they think we 're all the same ,  another undocumented worker told me . the fear is a reaction to what 's called the criminal alien program . since september of last year , irving police started to refer anyone arrested in their community to federal authorities , who check their immigration status .  it 's only for people who have violated texas laws , and are arrested and brought into the irving jail ,  said larry boyd , irving 's police chief . as a result , referrals for deportations have shot up to 1,600 , more than 40 times the number from the year before . statistics from police show that while some of those referrals were for people who committed serious crimes , the majority were a result of misdemeanors and traffic warrants . many sources told me that a growing number of latinos here are afraid to drive . the risk is being caught with a suspended license , going to jail and getting deported . see the effect the program has had on irving  but if some in the latino community are lying low , advocates for immigrants are speaking out -- accusing the city and police of targeting latinos without cause .  we believe the criminal alien program is fundamentally wrong ,  says carlos quintanilla , an activist .  that there is racial profiling going on .  the city 's mayor , herbert gears , disagrees . he says police are not taking on the role of immigration officers .  we will make sure people are being treated fairly ,  he said .  that people are n't being pulled over because of the color of their skin .  as i spent more time in irving , i came to realize that outside the large latino community , there is broad support for the program .  you have to start somewhere ,  said sheik shah , an irving resident who emigrated to the u.s. from india and is now an american citizen .  because right now , we have so many loopholes for people to come in here and work illegally .  some were more direct . i read from two tall stacks of printed e-mail addressed to the city council , which were overwhelmingly supported the criminal alien program . one read :  please help deport all illegals . what part of illegal do they not understand ?  another :  thank god some people are doing something about this invasion .  in the end , irving is in the middle of a profound disagreement , between those who feel it 's wrong to refer people to immigration authorities for nonviolent crimes and misdemeanors , and those who believe illegal immigration has gone too far -- that something has to be done . as irving city council member beth van duyne told me :  we need to know who is in our city . if you 're committing a crime , we need to know who you are . i do n't think that 's too much to ask .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
