{"text": "editor 's note : ann curley is the assignment manager for the cnn medical news unit . she has been a type i diabetic for 40 years . this is her story of life with diabetes . ann curley uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin . when i was 7 years old , my mom took me to the doctor because i had lost a lot of weight , despite a voracious appetite . my family had just moved from the san francisco bay area to pasadena , california , and this visit to the doctor 's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life . his name was dr. robert deputy , and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes . he spoke to me directly , rather than to my mother , and he asked me questions : did i feel thirsty ? did i need to urinate during the night ? the answer to both questions was yes . he asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate . dr. deputy told me and my mother that my body was n't processing sugar properly . i had diabetes . that is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began . i was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar , give myself injections of insulin , follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes . i spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease , and then they sent me home . dr. deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how i was doing . much to my parents ' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself . i refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine . this demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons , and not just for managing my diabetes . while some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden , i feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise . it forced our family to eat healthily , and it taught me about good nutrition -- something i practice every day . i know carbohydrate counts in most foods , and i understand dietary concepts that most people do n't even care about . being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar , so when my urine tested positive for glucose , my older sister robin was in charge of exercising me . we had countless jump-rope contests , bike rides and roller-skating excursions , keeping me and my three sisters active and fit . and i felt like a little mad scientist , using a test tube with drops of water , urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine . fortunately , over time , technology improved . first , test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it . but the truth is , testing urine for sugar was a primitive method . by the time sugar gets into the urine , it 's a signal that the body does n't have enough insulin to process sugar . and the urine test did n't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine . it simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine . inaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing . home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s , and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes . with the kit , the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood . the blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds . while i initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day , now i ca n't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing . the 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump . this device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin . the reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt . so rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body 's insulin patterns , the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant , then gives extra amounts with meals . another life-altering development in diabetes , which i have discovered in the last year , is the continuous glucose monitor , or cgm . this is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen , hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body 's fluids . the data is transmitted to a receiver , and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels . i have participated in clinical trials for three different cgm devices , and i found them all to be quite accurate . some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump , so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body . the patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated , but it 's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars . cgm technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type i diabetes using what 's called a  closed loop system .  this means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself . the current systems are  open looped ,  meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given . the goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system , and all the patient has to do is wear it . once that technology is perfected , this type of device would be implanted , which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes . i mentioned to my sister robin that i had tracked down dr. deputy for this article . she told me something i did n't know when i was 7 . forty years ago , before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps , continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing , parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare . dr. deputy told my parents that i would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30 , which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out . i spoke with dr. deputy , who recently retired from his pediatric practice , and he seemed to remember me . when i asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival , he said sadly ,  at that time , that was what we told parents back then . ... everything changes with time -- diabetes , leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment .  i think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong . i know that i certainly am . in fact , i am hoping to live another 40 years
