{"text": "kansas city , missouri president bush drew parallels between the aftermath of the vietnam war and the potential costs of pulling out of iraq in a speech wednesday . president bush draws parallels wednesday between the cost of pulling out of iraq and  the tragedy of vietnam .   three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left ,  bush told members of the veterans of foreign wars , at their convention in kansas city , missouri .  whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , '  the president said . the white house billed the speech , as it did next week 's address to the american legion , as an effort to  provide broader context  for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . bush also sought to shore up the perception of his support for iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki , after voicing some frustration with him on tuesday .  prime minister maliki 's a good guy -- good man with a difficult job and i support him ,  bush said .  and it 's not up to the politicians in washington , d.c. , to say whether he will remain in his position . watch bush reiterate his support for al-maliki  sen. edward kennedy , d-massachusetts , said bush had drawn the wrong lesson from history : .  america lost the war in vietnam because our troops were trapped in a distant country we did not understand supporting a government that lacked sufficient legitimacy with its people ,  kennedy said in a statement . sen. joe biden , democratic chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , invoked his own vietnam analogy in a statement released after the speech : .  it 's the president 's policies that are pushing us toward another saigon moment -- with helicopters fleeing the roof of our embassy -- which he says he wants to avoid .  biden said bush continues to cling to the premise that iraqis will rally behind a strong central government , but he believes that will not happen .  there 's no trust within the iraqi government ; no trust of the government by the iraqi people ; no capacity of that government to deliver security or services ; and no prospect that it will build that trust or capacity any time soon ,  biden 's statement said . but house republican leader john boehner of ohio said more democrats are  bucking their party leaders  in acknowledging progress in iraq .  many rank-and-file democrats have seen this progress firsthand and are now acknowledging the successes of a strategy they 've repeatedly opposed ,  boehner said in a statement .  but democratic leaders , deeply invested in losing the war , would rather move the goalposts and claim that a precipitous withdrawal is the right approach despite the overwhelming evidence of significant progress .  former presidential adviser david gergen said bush ran the risk of doing as much harm as good for his case .  by invoking vietnam he raised the question , ` if you learned so much from history , how did you ever get us involved in another quagmire ? '  gergen said . gergen said he did agree with bush in one respect , though :  he 's right , initially when we pulled back in vietnam there were massive killings .  on tuesday , bush had expressed frustration with the pace of progress toward political reconciliation in iraq , saying if the iraqi government does n't  respond to the demands of the people , they will replace the government .  iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki on wednesday shot back at criticism of his government , including pointed remarks from a u.s. senator who called his administration  nonfunctioning  and urged iraq 's parliament to turn it out of office . speaking at a press conference in the syrian capital of damascus , al-maliki characterized such comments as  irresponsible  and said they  overstep the bounds of diplomatic and political courtesy .  government spokesman ali dabbagh told cnn that al-maliki was referring to comments made monday by sen. carl levin , the michigan democrat who chairs the senate armed services committee , who called on iraq 's parliament to turn al-maliki 's  nonfunctioning  government out of office when it returns in two weeks . levin said al-maliki 's government was  too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders  to reach a political settlement that would end the country 's sectarian and insurgent violence . in his speech , bush said withdrawing from vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising u.s. credibility , citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam .  here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility , but the terrorists see things differently ,  bush said . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop  surge  in iraq until the report comes out in september . it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say the petraeus report will have no effect on their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush referred to previous conflicts in asia in talking about the war against terror in iraq .  there are many differences between the wars we fought in the far east and the war on terror we are fighting today ,  bush said .  but one important similarity is that at their core , they are all ideological struggles .  the militarists of japan and the communists in korea and vietnam were driven by a merciless vision for the proper ordering of humanity . they killed americans because we stood in the way of their attempt to force this ideology on others .  bush said history proved skeptics wrong about japan 's ability to become a free society and will prove those who want to withdraw from iraq wrong .  in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom ,  bush said .  today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
