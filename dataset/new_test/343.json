{"text": "washington the united states imposed stiff sanctions against iran on thursday , targeting two iranian military groups and a number of iranian banks and people it accuses of backing nuclear proliferation and terror-related activities .  what this means is that no u.s. citizen or private organization will be allowed to engage in financial transactions with these persons and entities ,  secretary of state condoleezza rice said .  in addition , any assets that these designees have under u.s. jurisdiction will be immediately frozen .  rice and treasury secretary henry paulson made the announcement in a brief appearance before reporters on thursday morning . rice accused iran of  pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon ; building dangerous ballistic missiles ; supporting shia militants in iraq and terrorists in iraq , afghanistan , lebanon and the palestinian territories ; and denying the existence of a fellow member of the united nations , threatening to wipe israel off the map .  watch rice tell why sanctions are being imposed   many of the iranian regime 's most destabilizing policies are carried out by two of its agencies : the islamic revolutionary guard corps , or the irgc , and the quds force , an arm of the irgc ,  she said . she said the sanctions were being imposed  because of the revolutionary guard 's support for proliferation and the quds force support for terrorism .  the united states also designated three iranian state-owned banks for sanctions , two of them  for their involvement in proliferation activities  and the other  as a terrorist financier ,  rice said .  iran funnels hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the international financial system to terrorists ,  paulson said .  iran 's banks aid this conduct using a range of deceptive financial practices intended to evade even the most stringent risk management controls .  the revolutionary guard corps , he said ,  is so deeply entrenched in iran 's economy and commercial enterprises , it is increasingly likely that , if you are doing business with iran , you are doing business  with the corps .  we call on responsible banks and companies around the world to terminate any business with bank melli , bank mellat , bank saderat , and all companies and entities  of the corps , paulson said . the move marks the first time the united states has attempted to punish another country 's military through sanctions . previous sanctions imposed by the united states have been tied to iran 's nuclear program . the united states has been working with other world powers to halt what they believe is iran 's intent to develop a nuclear arsenal . iran says it is pursuing nuclear power for peaceful reasons . mohamed elbaradei , director-general of the united nations ' international atomic energy agency , said last month that iran 's declared nuclear material has not been diverted from peaceful use and criticized u.s. rhetoric regarding iran . the quds force is blamed by the u.s. military for training and arming shiite militias in iraq and smuggling highly lethal explosives into iraq , where they are used to attack coalition forces . iran denies the charge .  if the iranian government fulfills its international obligation to suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activity , i will join my british , french , russian , chinese and german colleagues , and i will meet with my iranian counterpart any time , anywhere ,  rice said .  we will be open to the discussion of any issue . but if iran 's rulers choose to continue down a path of confrontation , the united states will act with the international community to resist these threats of the iranian regime .  last month , representatives of world powers announced that unless a november report shows a  positive outcome  of talks with iran about its uranium enrichment program , they will move ahead with plans for a resolution imposing additional sanctions on the country . the u.n. security council has repeatedly demanded that iran suspend enrichment of uranium and has imposed limited sanctions on tehran for refusing to comply . the european union is weighing its own unilateral sanctions . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's kathleen koch and elise labott contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
