{"text": "washington up to 80,000 items at the ronald reagan presidential library are unaccounted for , probably because of haphazard record-keeping and inventory procedures , officials said thursday . an audit found  significant breakdown in internal controls  at the ronald reagan presidential library . an audit completed last month by the national archives and records administration 's inspector general looked at the management of presidential artifacts at six presidential libraries . it  cites particular issues at the ronald reagan library . ... we acknowledge that problems exist in inventory control at the reagan library ,  said a statement from allen weinstein , national archivist . inspector general paul brachfield was more blunt . a  significant breakdown in internal controls  was found at the reagan library , in simi valley , california , he said in a statement thursday . the audit results prompted the ronald reagan presidential foundation to urge the national archives -- which is responsible for maintaining the artifacts -- to move quickly to fix the problems . the chairman of the board of trustees has contacted weinstein  to express the serious concerns and disappointment on behalf of the reagan foundation and mrs. reagan ,  the foundation said . library officials told auditors that  the collection contained approximately 100,000 items , yet the library systems only had information to locate and account for approximately 20,000 items ,  brachfield said .  this does not automatically mean the approximately 80,000 remaining items are missing . the vast majority may very well be safely located within the library 's storage facilities . ... some of these items may be missing or stolen , or none of these items may be missing or stolen .  control deficiencies at the library created an environment that could potentially have been exploited , brachfield said . although congress has a copy of the audit , it has not yet been made public because of the ongoing investigation into the whereabouts of the items . the count of 100,000 was an estimate taken from the original reagan white house gift unit database , weinstein said thursday , but was never meant to be used as a concrete inventory control number . the reagan library has already begun implementing recommendations from the audit , he said . it has upgraded its management inventory software , is hiring additional trained museum staff , has begun a comprehensive inventory and is addressing storage issues by reshelving artifacts and taking steps to protect artifacts in case of an earthquake .  like all of the presidential libraries , the reagan library stores their gifts in a locked vault , which is protected by a security camera ,  weinstein said . the audit examined management of artifacts at the reagan library ; the franklin d. roosevelt library ; the john f. kennedy library ; the gerald r. ford library ; the george bush library ; and the william j. clinton library , weinstein said .  early collections of artifacts came to presidential libraries with few controls and incomplete information relating to the collections ,  he said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
