{"text": "jacksonville , florida eduardo gonzalez , a petty officer second class with the u.s. navy , is about to be deployed overseas for a third time . making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back . mildred and eduardo gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported . his wife faces deportation to guatemala -- her home country that she has n't seen since 1989 . he also does n't know what would happen to his young son , eduardo jr. , if that happens .  i like being in uniform and serving my country , but if she goes back i 'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job ,  he said .  defending the country that 's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind .  gonzalez , who works on helicopters that bring cargo , supplies and military personnel in and out of iraq , testified before a house judiciary committee panel last month , detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his , where military members ' families could be deported while they 're defending their country overseas . watch  they 're tearing families apart    i want to serve my country 100 percent . but with this issue in the back of my mind , i feel i ca n't do that ,  he testified on september 6 . the u.s. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases . each is handled case-by-case , not by the military , but by immigration authorities . the government does n't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to gonzalez 's . immigration officials also said marrying a u.s. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to u.s. citizenship or permanent legal status . lt. col. margaret stock , a member of the u.s. army reserves who teaches immigration law at the u.s. military academy at west point , new york , said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members .  you got to understand . when you 're in a combat zone , you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy . you ca n't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you 're never going to see them again ,  she said . stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases . on the one hand , the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance , housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas . on the other hand , the same government is trying to deport the very same people .  what 's happening right now is , because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws , we 've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home ,  she said . in gonzalez 's case , his wife , mildred , came to the united states with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old . they were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from guatemala . in september 2000 , mildred 's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application . her mother was granted legal status in july 2004 , according to gonzalez . however , six weeks earlier , gonzalez and mildred got married , canceling mildred 's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21 . as a result , her legal status still remains in jeopardy . a judge in june granted her a one-year extension to remain in the united states . if her legal status does not change by june 8 , 2008 , she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation . that 's just fine , according to mark krikorian , the executive director of the center for immigration studies , which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration .  what you 're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces , and that 's just outrageous ,  he said .  what we 're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military . ... there 's no justification for that kind of policy .  gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified .  i 'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too .  gonzalez himself entered the country legally , crossing the mexican border with his family when he was about 10 . he joined the navy as a so-called  green-card sailor  and became a u.s. citizen in july 2005 . the military does accept some immigrants who are n't u.s. citizens .  i understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained , but on the other token , there are times when the situation is just out of their reach ,  gonzalez said . his wife , mildred , added ,  we did n't come here to break the law . we just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else .  u.s. army sgt. emmanuel woko , a member of the army 's 2nd brigade , 1st infantry division who faces his third tour in iraq , understands just how gonzalez and his family feel . his wife and children could be sent back to nigeria .  my heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to nigeria while i am deployed in iraq ,  he said .  i am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought .  that 's a sentiment echoed by gonzalez :  we are not asking for anything . we are just asking for our families to stay with us .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's gregg canes contributed to this report .", "summary": "no
