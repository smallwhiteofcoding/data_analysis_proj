{"text": "los angeles , california the transportation security administration said friday its officers at a texas airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings -- one with pliers -- but acknowledged the procedures should be changed . the woman involved -- mandi hamlin -- told reporters earlier friday she was humiliated by last month 's incident , in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male tsa officers nearthe officers  rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved ,  the tsa said in a statement posted on its web site friday afternoon .  tsa supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing lubbock that day .  however ,  tsa has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed ,  the statement said .  in the future , tsa will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question .  hamlin and her lawyer , celebrity attorney gloria allred , said they want a public apology from the agency , as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect . allred pointed out that tsa 's web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said hamlin was never offered .  the conduct of tsa was cruel and unnecessary ,  allred told reporters at a news conference .  last time that i checked , a nipple was not a dangerous weapon .  she said if an apology was not forthcoming ,  mandi is going to have to consider her legal options .  attempts by cnn to reach allred for a response to the tsa statement friday afternoon were unsuccessful . tsa said in its statement it acknowledges  that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets -lrb- the -rrb- situation in which she found herself . we appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again .  the incident occurred february 24 as hamlin , 37 , was preparing to fly to dallas-fort worth from lubbock , where she had been visiting her elderly great-uncle . hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport . she did not set off the metal detector at lubbock international airport , but was pulled to the side for additional screening , allred said . a hand wand used by a tsa officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts . hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings , allred said , and that officer called over another officer , who told her she would need to remove them .  ms. hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings ,  allred said , reading from a letter she sent tsa .  after nipple rings are inserted , the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove . in addition , once removed , the pierced skin may close up almost immediately , making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing .  more officers were called over , and the group grew to four male and two female tsa officers , according to hamlin . also , a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather . the officers insisted that hamlin remove the nipple rings , allred said .  she felt humiliated by the scene that the tsa officers were making ,  allred said .  with tears streaming down her face , she again asked to show the piercings to a tsa officer instead of having to remove them . she was told , however , she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them . had she been told that she had a right to a pat-down , she would have chosen that option .  she eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings , allred said . one came out easily , but the other would not , and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers . she was handed a large pair , allred said .  as ms. hamlin struggled to remove the piercing , behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male tsa officers snickering in the background ,  allred said in the letter .  mandi hamlin was publicly humiliated . ... clearly , this is not how passengers should be treated .  watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry  afterward , hamlin underwent another scan , but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring . she offered to remove it , allred said , but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it . hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed , allred said .  i would n't wish this experience upon anyone ,  hamlin told reporters .  i felt surprised , embarrassed , humiliated and scared . no one deserves to go through this .  in a statement earlier friday , the tsa said it  is well aware of terrorists ' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body . therefore , we have a duty to the american public to resolve any alarm that we discover .  tsa included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a  bra bomb  in training and testing its officers . hamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted , and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed .  people who are pierced should not be snickered at , should not become the object of ridicule , should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment ,  allred said .  they should be respected just like everybody else .  she said she had received a call from tsa 's public affairs office friday morning .  we hope that means they 're going to jump on this and do something about it ,  she said .  we want tsa to do the right thing now . we 're going to give them the opportunity .  hamlin said she will continue to fly but will avoid the lubbock airport . the next time she visits her great-uncle , she said ,  i will be driving .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mike ahlers contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
