{"text": "washington a slim majority of americans think churches should stay out of politics , according to a new survey . john mccain , the rev. rick warren and barack obama together for a cnn broadcast forum on faith . the survey suggests that for the first time in more than a decade , there has been a shift away from the view that religious groups should influence social and political issues . fifty-two percent of poll respondents said churches should stay quiet , while 46 percent said churches should express political views . the biggest shift has come among republicans , one of the authors of the poll said .  overall , the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly , but among republicans it is up 11 points , and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points ,  said greg smith , a research fellow at the pew forum on religion & public life .  there is a slight uptick , from 40 percent to 46 percent , among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion , but it is up 10 points among republicans ,  he added . four years ago , seven out of 10 conservatives approved of religious institutions expressing political views . but five out of 10 conservatives in thursday 's poll said it was appropriate . it seems that the more important social issues are to conservatives , the more likely they were to say that religion and politics should not mix . among people who said gay marriage was a very important issue , the number saying houses of worship should keep out of politics doubled , from 25 percent to 50 percent . among those who said it was not important , the number was essentially unchanged . respondents were also more likely to say houses of worship should not meddle in politics if they considered the major political parties to be hostile to religion . the new figures bring republican views into line with those of democrats and independents . a 14-point gap between republican and democratic views on the subject in august 2004 fell to one point in the new survey . but smith cautioned against reading the survey to mean basic conservative philosophy was changing .  it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift ,  he said .  it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion , but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics .   voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all ,  smith added . republican candidate sen. john mccain  has a huge lead even among younger evangelicals .  but social conservatives are lukewarm about mccain as compared to president bush . nearly seven out of 10 white evangelical protestants and conservatives said they supported mccain ; the number was slightly higher for bush in august 2004 . but four years ago , 57 percent of them said they backed bush strongly . the number is 28 percent for mccain this year , with 40 percent saying they backed him , but not strongly . the number of people who think religious groups have too much influence over political parties grew -- for both republicans and democrats -- as did the percentage of people who are uncomfortable hearing politicians talk about how religious they are . americans continue to see the republican party as more friendly to religion than the democrats , although the democrats closed the gap somewhat since reaching a low point in 2006 . other survey results showed little change from the past . two out of three americans continue to say churches should not endorse candidates for president , and most still feel a president should have strong religious beliefs . the survey was conducted by the pew research center for people & the press and the pew forum on religion & public life by interviewing 2,905 adults nationwide by phone between july 31 and august 10 . on saturday , obama and mccain answered questions that had religious overtones at a forum hosted by the rev. rick warren . the pastor of southern california 's saddleback church is author of the best-selling book  the purpose-driven life .  asked when life begins , mccain was quick to say  at the moment of conception .  mccain 's response was met with huge applause from the audience .  i have a 25-year pro-life record in the congress , in the senate , and as president of the united states , i will be a pro-life president , and this presidency will have pro-life policies ,  he said . when obama was asked about when life begins , the pro-choice candidate said that decision is  above my pay grade .  the response garnered criticism from liberal and conservative thinkers who said obama tried to dodge the issue . obama said although he 's pro-choice and supports a woman 's right to abortion , his goal is to reduce the number of abortions in america .  on this particular issue , if you believe that life begins at conception ... and you are consistent , then i ca n't argue with you on that ,  he said .  what i can do is say , ` are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies ?
