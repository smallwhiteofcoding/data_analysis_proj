{"text": "a chinese couple tried to name their baby  @ ,  claiming the character used in e-mail addresses echoed their love for the child , an official trying to whip the national language into line said on thursday . the unusual name stands out especially in chinese , which has no alphabet and instead uses tens of thousands of multi-stroke characters to represent words .  the whole world uses it to write e-mail , and translated into chinese it means ` love him ' ,  the father explained , according to the deputy chief of the state language commission li yuming . while the  @  symbol is familiar to chinese e-mail users , they often use the english word  at  to sound it out -- which with a drawn out  t  sounds something like  ai ta ,  or  love him ,  to mandarin speakers . li told a news conference on the state of the language that the name was an extreme example of people 's increasingly adventurous approach to chinese , as commercialisation and the internet break down conventions . another couple tried to give their child a name that rendered into english sounds like  king osrina .  li did not say if officials accepted the  @  name . but earlier this year the government announced a ban on names using arabic numerals , foreign languages and symbols that do not belong to chinese minority languages . sixty million chinese faced the problem that their names use ancient characters so obscure that computers can not recognize them and even fluent speakers were left scratching their heads , said li , according to a transcript of the briefing on the government web site -lrb- www.gov.cn -rrb- . one of them was the former premier zhu rongji , whose name had a rare  rong  character that gave newspaper editors headaches . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .", "summary": "no summary"}
