{"text": "baghdad , iraq darryl mathis waits in his pensacola , florida , home for the body of his 24-year-old son to return home from iraq . mathis , a military veteran himself , was seething with anger thursday as he spoke about the death of army staff sgt. darris j. dawson . an unnamed u.s. soldier is accused of killing army staff sgt. darris j. dawson in iraq on sunday . dawson , and sgt. wesley durbin , 26 , are said to have been shot and killed by another u.s. soldier on sunday at a base south of baghdad . darryl and his wife , maxine -lrb- dawson 's stepmother -rrb- , say the military has told them nothing about the incident : no details on his death , no information at all . his voice shakes as he says he believes that the military has let him down .  i 'm very disappointed -- very ,  he said .  if i would get a straight answer , if they would actually tell me what 's going on , i would have something to work on ; but right now , i have nothing to work on . everything i 'm getting , i 'm getting from the media .  his wife sobs as she says her stepson 's death was foreshadowed by a phone call he made to her from iraq .  he said that he was more shaky sometimes of the soldiers than of the enemy , because of the young guys over there .  she said she asked him ,  what in the world do you mean ? you 're afraid of your own soldiers ?   ` these kids are trying to fight a war they know nothing about . ... they 're jumpy . ... they 're more scary than the enemy , '  she said he told her .  and i said , ` oh , god , '  said maxine mathis . on any given day , cnn receives dozens of detailed news releases from the u.s. military , including those announcing u.s. military casualties . in the cases of dawson and durbin , there was no mention of their names , and the releases were terse .  a multi-national division center soldier died this morning of non-combat related causes ,  the first release read .  the cause of death is under investigation .  a second release came later in the day .  a second multi-national division center soldier died this morning of non-combat related causes . the solider died of wounds september 14 at a coalition forces combat army support hospital ,  it read .  the incident is under investigation .  inquiries thursday from cnn were met with a news release that a press officer said had been drafted wednesday . however , the release had not been e-mailed to reporters wednesday , as is customary . after naming the two soldiers and giving their rank and unit , it reads ,  a u.s. soldier is in custody in connection with the shooting deaths . he is being held in custody pending review by a military magistrate . the incident continues under investigation .  the release gives no other details . the u.s. military is classifying the death of sgt. dawson as  non-hostile ,  something dawson 's father finds puzzling .  i do n't know . i really do n't know ,  he said .  i just ca n't get it together with that . i had never heard that before . ` non-hostile ' in a war zone ?  lt. col. paul swiergosz is a public affairs officer for the area in iraq where the incident took place . he says the  non-hostile  death classification was given  because the deaths were not the result of hostile enemy action .  but details on what happened remain scarce . after asking , cnn received an e-mail press release from gen. tony cucolo , commanding general of the third infantry division that a press officer said had been drafted on wednesday . the release , however , had not been e-mailed to reporters , as is customary .  we do know one soldier , a fellow noncommissioned officer , allegedly opened fire and mortally wounded his squad leader and fellow team leader ,  reads the statement . a spokesman at fort stewart in georgia said ,  a soldier has been taken into custody . the incident is under investigation , and that is all i can say .  the spokesman would not even confirm information in his commanding general 's press statement . maxine mathis says she is stunned at how her stepson 's death has been handled by the military . she says the army assigned someone to help the family with anything they needed once they found out darris had been killed , but she and her husband do n't know how he died . she said her husband asked the liaison officer whether it was true that darris had been killed by another u.s. solider . she said the officer denied it , insisting he did n't know anything else . darryl mathis continues to express his disappointment in the lack of information from the military about his son , amid rumors his son 's body could be home by saturday .  i do n't even know where he 's at , at this time ,  he said . bobby muller , president of veterans for america , said he thinks the way the military classifies deaths in iraq is an attempt to keep the public combat numbers down .  there is a clear and long-standing record , regarding the classification of causalities in iraq to minimize combat losses . and we 're seeing people wounded and killed that would have well been considered casualties from hostile action in previous conflicts . it 's an attempt to conceal the actual cost of this war in terms of casualties ,  muller said .  the department of defense has announced the death of every service member who has given their life in operation iraqi and enduring freedom ,  said a pentagon spokesman , col. gary keck .  we have been open and transparent on the numbers of casualties suffered in these operations .  mathis says his son wanted to come home to his wife and four young children and was in the process of applying for a transfer .  last i spoke to him was last week monday . he called every monday , and said he was checking his paperwork . he said he was going to call me back once he found out . that was the last i heard from him .  mathis ' wife can not stop sobbing .  we do n't know why , we do n't know why ,  she says  all we know is that our son died a useless , needless death . that 's all we know .  cnn 's mike mount and jomana karadsheh contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
