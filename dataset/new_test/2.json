{"text": "minneapolis , minnesota drivers who were on the minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival .  the whole bridge from one side of the mississippi to the other just completely gave way , fell all the way down ,  survivor gary babineau told cnn .  i probably had a 30 - , 35-foot free fall . and there 's cars in the water , there 's cars on fire . the whole bridge is down .  he said his back was injured but he determined he could move around .  i realized there was a school bus right next to me , and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge . they were yelling , screaming , bleeding . i think there were some broken bones .  watch a driver describe his narrow escape  at home when he heard about the disaster , dr. john hink , an emergency room physician , jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes . he arrived at the south side of the bridge , stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck . they were in the middle of the mississippi river , which was churning fast , and he had no way of getting to them . he went to the north side , where there was easier access to people . ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene . working feverishly , volunteers , emts and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours . occasionally , a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground , hink told cnn . the rescue effort was controlled and organized , he said ; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse .  i could see the whole bridge as it was going down , as it was falling ,  babineau said .  it just gave a rumble real quick , and it all just gave way , and it just fell completely , all the way to the ground . and there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying : it was just like out of the movies .  babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge . he said several vehicles slid past him into the water .  i stayed in my car for one or two seconds . i saw a couple cars fall ,  he said .  so i stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second , then i got out real quick , ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and i helped a woman off of the bridge with me .  i just wanted off the bridge , and then i ran over to the school bus . i started grabbing kids and handing them down . it was just complete chaos .  he said most of the children were crying or screaming . he and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank , but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries . see rescuers clamber over rubble  babineau said he had no rescue training .  i just knew what i had to do at the moment .  melissa hughes , 32 , of minneapolis , told the associated press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her .  you know that free-fall feeling ? i felt that twice ,  hughes said . a pickup landed on top of her car , but she was not hurt .  i had no idea there was a vehicle on my car ,  she told ap .  it 's really very surreal .  babineau told the minneapolis star-tribune :  on the way down , i thought i was dead . i literally thought i was dead .  my truck was completely face down , pointed toward the ground , and my truck got ripped in half . it was folded in half , and i ca n't believe i 'm alive .  see and hear eyewitness accounts  bernie toivonen told cnn 's  american morning  that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle .  i knew the deck was going down , there was no question about it , and i thought i was going to die ,  he said . after the bridge settled and his car remained upright ,  i just put in park , turned the key off and said , ` oh , i 'm alive , '  he said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
