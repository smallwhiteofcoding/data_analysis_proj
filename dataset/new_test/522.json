{"text": "atlanta , georgia it 's a neighborhood of shotgun houses painted a rainbow of colors , a community of artists , workaday folks and students where everyone knows everyone 's name . destruction in atlanta 's historic cabbagetown district , which many artists call home . saturday morning , people were out walking their dogs , sipping coffee and taking a look at who was hit the worst in atlanta 's cabbagetown district . it appeared friday night 's 130 mph tornado had delivered its wrath randomly -- some houses were perfectly intact while others were flooded and smashed .  it 's a sad thing ,  said 56-year-old bertha wise , standing next to a splintered tree that had buried her car and blocked a side-door to her yellow and cobalt-blue house . a sign advertising her hand-crafted art , which she sells from her home , hung slightly askew .  i was cooking dinner and the lights started to flicker ,  she said .  there was no warning . my door flung open and papers went flying . by that time , there was nowhere to go .  without a basement , she hunkered down and hoped for the best . but wise fared well compared with her neighbors in this historic neighborhood , which has gone from crime-ridden to cool in recent years . a few blocks down , a woman named rebecca -- too distraught to speak with a reporter -- carried what belongings she had left out of her rental home , which had been split in half by a giant oak tree . watch residents describe the storm 's quick arrival  she was n't at home at the time , her landlord mark rogers told cnn , which was a good thing for her safety . but in the early morning hours , looters got there before she had and took almost everything . looting was a problem throughout the neighborhood , many said . see photos of the damage  a few doors down from her , pastor richard davis stared up at the tire-size hole in the roof of his eastside christian community pentecostal church . he has been preaching in its single room for 10 years .  yes ... well , that is something is n't it ?  he said , then gestured to the church 's bathroom -- a brick yellow outhouse .  that 's still here though . we 'll be ok .  he plans to give a sermon on palm sunday and ask his parishioners to pray hard that lack of insurance wo n't force him to close his doors . steven and laura powell , thinking they were in store for a short lightning storm , were startled by the storm 's quick escalation . they were frightened when they spotted the storm beginning to circulate in the distance from their tiny home , and rushed to scoop up their sleeping 5-week-old audrey . bundled in a soft pink onesie , audrey was still sleeping saturday morning as her parents walked the neighborhood , amazed that their home had not been damaged -- and that their daughter had snoozed through the entire ordeal .  i just put myself on top of -lsb- laura -rsb- and the baby and we got under the strongest beam in the house ,  said steven powell .  i thought that if a tree came crashing through , i 'd take the brunt of it .  cabbagetown 's houses were built for the workers at the local fulton cotton mill . the mill closed and the neighborhood slid into decay . the renaissance of cabbagetown began when the mill buildings were converted to the trendy fulton cotton mill lofts and the artists and urban pioneers moved in . in addition to hitting the houses , friday night 's tornado seriously damaged the top floor of the lofts . remarkably , nobody was hurt . cabbagetown residents remember when the under-construction lofts survived a five-alarm fire in 1999 -- and say they plan to rebuild and survive this disaster as well . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
