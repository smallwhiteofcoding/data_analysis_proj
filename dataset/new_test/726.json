{"text": "washington former terrorist suspects detained by the united states were tortured , according to medical examinations detailed in a report released wednesday by a human rights group . a u.s. serviceman with his dog watches a detainee at abu ghraib prison in iraq in 2003 . the massachusetts-based physicians for human rights reached that conclusion after two-day clinical evaluations of 11 former detainees , who had been held at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , at guantanamo bay , cuba , and in afghanistan . the detainees were never charged with crimes .  we found clear physical and psychological evidence of torture and abuse , often causing lasting suffering ,  said dr. allen keller , a medical evaluator for the study . in a 121-page report , the doctors ' group said that it uncovered medical evidence of torture , including beatings , electric shock , sleep deprivation , sexual humiliation , sodomy and scores of other abuses . the report is prefaced by retired u.s. major gen. antonio taguba , who led the army 's investigation into the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in 2003 . watch why a rights group says there 's evidence of torture   there is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes ,  taguba says .  the only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account .  over the years , reports of abuses at abu ghraib and allegations of torture at guantanamo prompted the bush administration to deny that the u.s. military tortures detainees . since only 11 detainees were examined  the findings of this assessment can not be generalized to the treatment of all detainees in u.s. custody ,  the report says . however , the incidents documented are consistent with findings of other investigations into government treatment ,  making it reasonable to conclude that these detainees were not the only ones abused , but are representative of a much larger number of detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment while in u.s. custody .  four of the men evaluated were arrested in or taken to afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 and later were sent to guantanamo bay , where they were held for an average of three years before being released without charge , the report says . the other seven were detained in iraq in 2003 and released within a year , the report says . all the subjects told examiners that they were subjected to multiple forms of torture or ill treatment that  often occurred in combination over a long period of time ,  the report says . while the report presents synopses of the detainees ' backgrounds based on interviews with them , the authors did not have access to the detainees ' medical histories . therefore , there 's no way to know whether any of the inmates may have had medical or mental problems before being detained . among the ex-detainees was an iraqi in his mid-40s , identified only as laith , whom u.s. soldiers took into custody in october 2003 and who was released from abu ghraib in june 2004 . according to the report , laith was subjected to sleep deprivation , electric shocks and threats of sexual abuse to himself and his family .  they took off even my underwear . they asked me to do some movements that make me look in a very bad way so they can take photographs . ... they were trying to make me look like an animal ,  laith told examiners , according to the report . according to the report , laith said the most  painful  experiences involved threats to his family :  and they asked me , ` have you ever heard voices of women in this prison ? ' i answered , ` yes . ' they were saying , ` then you will hear your mothers and sisters when we are raping them . '  the examiners concluded in the report that  laith appears to have suffered severe and lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of his arrest and incarceration at abu ghraib prison .  another detainee , youssef , was detained by u.s. soldiers nearly seven years ago when he tried to enter afghanistan from neighboring pakistan without a passport , the report says . he initially was held in an afghan prison , where he describes  being stripped naked , being intimidated by dogs , being hooded and being thrown against the wall on repeated occasions ,  the report says . a few months later , he was taken to the guantanamo bay facility , where he was subjected to interrogators who would enter his cell and force him to lie on the floor with his hands tied behind his back to his feet , the report says . youssef said the interrogators wanted him to confess of involvement with the taliban , the report says . based on its investigation , the report calls on the u.s. government to issue a formal apology to detainees subject to torture and ill treatment by the military since fall 2001 in afghanistan , iraq , guantanamo bay and elsewhere . the rights group also demands that the bush administration : . •  repudiate all forms of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment  ; . • establish an independent commission to investigate and report publicly the circumstances of detention and interrogation at u.s.-run prisons in afghanistan , iraq and guantanamo bay ; . • hold individuals involved in torturing detainees accountable through criminal and civil processes ; and . • monitor thoroughly the conditions at u.s.-run prisons all over the world . cnn radio contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
