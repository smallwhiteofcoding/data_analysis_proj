{"text": "dorchester , england englishman john webber thought nothing of the small , shiny cup , passed down from his junk dealer grandfather and stashed under a bed for years , until appraisers said it was an ancient persian artifact . the ancient persian gold cup , thought to date from the third or fourth century b.c. , fetched $ 100,000 at auction . the 5 1/2 - inch gold cup , which experts have dated to the third or fourth century b.c. , fetched $ 100,000 at an auction in dorchester , southern england , thursday . the identity of the winning bidder was n't immediately known . the relic features the double faced ancient roman god janus , the god of gates and doors who always looked to both the future and past and is often associated with beginnings and endings . the cup has two faces with braided hair and entwined snake ornaments at the forehead . webber 's grandfather , william sparks , was a rag and bone man , the british term for a junk dealer , duke 's said , who established the iron merchants sparks and son in taunton , somerset , in southwestern england , in the 1930s . sparks acquired the cup along with two other pieces , also up for auction , in the 1930s or 1940s , the spokeswoman said . watch cnn report on the auction  before he died , sparks gave the items to webber , who did n't realize their value , the spokeswoman said .  because he mainly dealt in brass and bronze , i thought that was what it was made from ,  webber told the bournemouth news and picture service .  i put it in a box and forgot about it . then last year i moved house and took it out to have a look , and i realized it was n't bronze or brass .  i sent it to the british museum , and the experts there had n't seen anything like it before and recommended i had it tested at a laboratory . so i paid quite a bit of money for it to be examined by a lab the museum recommended . and they found the gold dated from the third of fourth century b.c.  webber , who is in his 70s , said he remembers the cup from when he was a small boy .  it 's been quite exciting finding out what it was ,  he told the agency . webber brought the items to duke 's at the start of the year for potential sale , because he wanted to  realize some money ,  the auction house spokeswoman said . a spokeswoman for duke 's auction house , which is selling the cup , said the cup is believed to be from the archaemenid empire in ancient persia . the other two items are a second century b.c. round gold mount with a figure , probably of ancient greek hero ajax , who besieged troy , and a decorated gold spoon with an image of a roman emperor .  he had a good eye for quality over the years ,  said the spokeswoman , who asked not to be named ,  and anything interesting he 'd put aside .  scientists analyzed trace elements of a gold sample taken from the cup to determine its age , and analysts from oxford university concluded that they are consistent with archaemenid gold and goldsmithing , duke 's said .", "summary": "no summary"}
