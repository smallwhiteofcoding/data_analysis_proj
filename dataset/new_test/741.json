's office and the stanly county sheriff have gathered evidence from witnesses saying that betty neumar solicited to commit murder to her husband , harold . thomas harold gentry was shot to death in norwood home near the back door inside the home . he was found by friends or family members -- i believe friendly members sent there by his employers . he did n't report to work . ... and -lsb- they -rsb- discover him there dead , and then the investigation there ensues but did not lead to anything enough to press charges against anyone . grace : . . jay , what can you tell me about this woman ? what is her background ? almond : she 's a 76-year-old widow ... and she 's been married four other times . she initially was inviting to family members , but then sort of became more of a wedge in the family and has gone from there , got colder and -- with previous family members .", "summary": "no summary"}
