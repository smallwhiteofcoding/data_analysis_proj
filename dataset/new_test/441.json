{"text": "baghdad , iraq four u.s. soldiers died in a roadside bombing in iraq on sunday , military officials reported , bringing the american toll in the 5-year-old war to the grim milestone of 4,000 deaths . troops emerge from a bunker after receiving the  all clear  sunday following a truck bombing in mosul . the four were killed when their vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device while patrolling a neighborhood in southern baghdad , the u.s. military headquarters in iraq reported sunday night . a fifth soldier was wounded in the attack , which took place about 10 p.m. -lrb- 3 p.m. et -rrb- . the u.s. milestone comes just days after americans marked the fifth anniversary of the start of the war .  no casualty is more or less significant than another ; each soldier , marine , airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic ,  rear admiral gregory smith , the u.s. military 's chief spokesman in iraq , said .  every single loss of a soldier , sailor , airman or marine is keenly felt by military commanders , families and friends both in theatre and at home ,  smith said . of the 4,000 u.s. military personnel killed in the war , 3,263 have been killed in attacks and fighting and 737 in non-hostile incidents , such as traffic accidents and suicides . eight of the 4,000 killed were civilians working for the pentagon . many of those killed over the years , like the four soldiers slain on sunday in baghdad , have been targeted by improvised explosive devices -- the roadside bombs that have been described as the weapon of choice for insurgents and a weapon that has come to symbolize iraq 's tenacious insurgency . the existence of the pentagon 's joint improvised explosive device defeat organization has been developed to counter the threat of ieds in iraq as well as afghanistan . the group calls ieds the  weapon of choice for adaptive and resilient networks of insurgents and terrorists .  watch how ieds have become deadly staple in iraq war  meanwhile , estimates of the iraqi death toll range from about 80,000 to the hundreds of thousands , with another 2 million forced to leave the country and 2.5 million people displaced within iraq , according to the u.n. high commissioner for refugees . president bush ordered u.s. troops into iraq on march 19 , 2003 , after months of warnings that then-iraqi leader saddam hussein was concealing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb . u.n. weapons inspectors found no sign of banned weapons before the invasion , and the cia later concluded that iraq had dismantled its weapons programs in the 1990s . hussein 's government fell in early april 2003 , and iraq 's new government executed him in december 2006 . the news of the 4,000 mark came on the same day that iraq 's national security adviser urged americans to be patient with the progress of the war , contending that it is  well worth fighting  because it has implications about  global terror .   this is global terrorism hitting everywhere , and they have chosen iraq to be a battlefield . and we have to take them on ,  mowaffak al-rubaie said sunday on cnn 's  late edition with wolf blitzer .   if we do n't prevail , if we do n't succeed in this war , then we are doomed forever ,  he said .  i understand and sympathize with the mothers , with the widows , with the children who have lost their beloved ones in this country .  but honestly , it is well worth fighting and well worth investing the money and the treasure and the sweat and the tears in iraq .  nearly 160,000 u.s. troops remain in iraq , and the war has cost u.s. taxpayers about $ 600 billion , according to the house budget committee . the conflict is now widely unpopular among americans : a cnn-opinion research corp. poll out wednesday found only 32 percent of americans support the conflict . and 61 percent said they want the next president to remove most u.s. troops within a few months of taking office . in the weekly democratic radio address saturday , sen. bob menendez of new jersey said president bush  took us to war on the wings of a lie .  menendez said that the war has depleted the resources and morale of the u.s. military ; diverted national attention away from the war in afghanistan , where al qaeda is regrouping ; and hurt the hunt for osama bin laden . the iraq war has not made americans safer , menendez said , but has instead hurt the u.s. economy . the senator called for a  responsible new direction  regarding iraq . cnn learned last week , from several u.s. military officials familiar with the recommendations but not authorized to speak on the record , that senior u.s. military officials are preparing to recommend to bush a four - to six-week  pause  in additional troop withdrawals from iraq after the last of the  surge  brigades leaves in july .  if the conditions on the ground dictate that we have to have a pause , then we will have to have a pause ,  al-rubaie said . the return of all five brigades added to the iraq contingent last year could reduce troop levels by up to 30,000 , but still leave approximately 130,000 or more troops in iraq . al-rubaie emphasized sunday that any drawdown of u.s. troops  has to be based on the conditions on the ground .   it depends on the development and the growth and the equipment and the capabilities of the iraqi security forces , and the preparedness of the iraqi security forces ,  he said .  this should not be a purely political decision . it should be also a technical , military and intelligence decision .  but there has been too much  foot-dragging on key governance questions in iraq ,  democratic sen. ron wyden of oregon said on cnn on sunday .  it seems to me you put off those troop withdrawals , you send exactly the wrong message to the iraqis .  on wednesday , bush will visit the pentagon to be briefed by the joint chiefs of staff , chaired by adm. michael mullen . the american troop level in iraq  depends on the negotiations that we are engaged in now between the government of iraq and the united states government ,  al-rubaie said . when conditions warrant the withdrawal of american troops , the iraqis will say  ` thank you very much , indeed , '  al-rubaie said .  a big , big thank you for the united states of america for liberating iraq , for helping us in sustaining the security gains in iraq ... and we will give them a very , very good farewell party then .  responding to recent remarks from u.s. presidential candidates that iraqis are not taking responsibility for their own future , al-rubaie said iraqis are making political and security gains .  literally by the day and by the week , we are gradually assuming more responsibility ,  he said , noting that iraqis have taken responsibility for security in many provinces . other developments : . • u.s. troops raided a suspected suicide bomber cell in diyala province on sunday , killing a dozen militants , half of whom had shaved their bodies -- which the u.s. military says indicates they were in the final stage of preparation for a suicide attack . diyala province stretches north and east of baghdad and has been a major front for u.s. troops fighting militants . • several mortars landed in baghdad 's international zone on sunday , according to the interior ministry . a u.s. embassy spokeswoman said there were no major casualties . watch smoke rise from the green zone  • a suicide car bomb exploded at a fuel station sunday in a predominantly shiite neighborhood in northwest baghdad , killing seven people and wounding 12 others , the interior ministry said . • a suicide bomber detonated a truck full of explosives outside the main gate of an iraqi military base in mosul , killing at least 10 iraqi soldiers and wounding 35 people , including 20 soldiers , mosul police said . the u.s. military put the death toll higher , at 12 . • a mortar round landed in a shiite neighborhood in eastern baghdad , killing seven people and injuring nine others , a ministry official said . six more mortar rounds landed in other baghdad neighborhoods sunday night , killing three people , the interior ministry said . • in southeastern baghdad , gunmen riding in at least two cars opened fire on a crowded outdoor market , killing at least three people and wounding 17 others , the interior ministry said . • a suicide bomber detonated a small truck rigged with explosives outside a local awakening council leader 's house just east of samarra on saturday , killing at least five people and wounding 13 others , a samarra police official said . awakening councils are largely sunni security groups that have been recruited by the u.s. military . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mohammed tawfeeq contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
