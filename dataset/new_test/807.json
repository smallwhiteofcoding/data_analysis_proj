{"text": "new delhi , india president george w. bush called india 's prime minister thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the indian leader this week , a white house spokesman said . prime minister manmohan singh won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal .  both leaders expressed their desire to see the u.s.-india civil nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible ,  gordon johndroe said . the phone call took place two days after indian prime minister manmohan singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of parliament . the vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that india was kowtowing to the u.s. . the tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by bush and singh a year ago . under the agreement , which will need to be approved by the u.s. congress , india would have access to u.s. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants . that would happen even though new delhi , which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998 , has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements . in return , india has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program , and it would allow the international atomic energy agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants . the plan would also expand u.s.-indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology . the plan was approved by india 's cabinet last year , and does not have to be ratified by the parliament . the leaders of india 's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in parliament -- have accused singh of surrendering india 's sovereignty to the united states with the deal . a no-confidence vote would have forced singh to resign , and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed . the congress party-led coalition has governed india since 2004 . tuesday 's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of singh 's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers . shortly after singh survived the vote , white house spokeswoman dana perino praised the deal as  a good one for everybody .   it 's good for india because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need , one that is nonpolluting and one that does n't emit greenhouse gas emissions ,  she said .  and we think that we can move forward with this . if their legislature lets it move forward , then we can do the same here and then we 'll be able to get this wrapped up .
