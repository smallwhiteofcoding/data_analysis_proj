{"text": "editor 's note :  glenn beck  is on headline news nightly at 7 and 9 et . glenn beck says to always question conventional wisdom . new york  the people who survived the great depression were the ones who had money to buy when everybody else was selling .  -- my grandfather . i learned a lot from my grandfather , but that might have been the greatest lesson he ever taught me . he was n't just talking about managing money , he was talking about managing life -- and his words have stuck with me since i was a child . a few years back , i was taking a theology course and the professor recommended only the books whose authors he agreed with . i read those books , but i also asked that professor which books he thought had it completely wrong -- and i read those too . then i made up my own mind . after all , following the herd is fine until they all run off the side of a cliff together . less than a year ago , a recession was the last thing on anyone 's mind . in fact , over the summer , as i was questioning the conventional wisdom , i read an article on my television show that quoted a financial expert as saying ,  it is the strongest global market that we 've seen in the history of measuring these things .  that 's when i realized how fast the herd was approaching the cliff . but with predictions of a recession now more common than fed rate cuts -- and that 's saying something -- maybe now it 's time to look at a worst-case scenario . after all , considering all sides of an issue , no matter how extreme they may be , does n't make you a crazy person ; it makes you an educated one . so to understand what a real meltdown could look like , i turned to nouriel roubini , chairman of rge monitor and professor of economics at new york university 's stern school of business . he 's also a former adviser to the u.s. treasury department . professor roubini recently laid out what he called the  12 steps to financial disaster .  unfortunately , they were really complicated , and i have severe add , so i 've boiled them down into five phases that even a rodeo clown like me can understand . i think of these like our military 's  defcon  -- or defense readiness condition -- scale , except that this countdown could end in the meltdown of your bank account : . • defconomy five . how you 'll know we 're here : the housing downturn turns into a free fall , making it the worst collapse in our country 's history . that not only triggers massive numbers of foreclosures and lost household wealth , but it also sets off another large wave of bank write-downs . odds we get here : roubini told me that it 's  extremely likely , even unavoidable  that we hit this stage because  the excess supply of new homes in the market is like we 've never seen before .  prices , he believes ,  need to fall another 10 to 20 percent before that clears .  • defconomy four . how you 'll know we 're here : americans upside-down on their mortgages and unable to pay their home equity loans begin defaulting on other debt , like credit cards , car loans and student loans . in addition , bond insurance companies lose their perfect credit ratings , forcing already troubled banks to write down another $ 150 billion . odds we get here : high . roubini says that 8 million households are already upside-down on their mortgages and he thinks we could see that number go to between 16 million and 24 million by the end of 2009 . a lot of those people , he believes , will simply walk away from their homes and send their keys back to the bank . • defconomy three . how you 'll know we 're here : some banks begin to crack under the pressure of continuing write-downs and mounting defaults by consumers . a national or large regional bank finally collapses , triggering hedge fund failures and general chaos on wall street , potentially leading to a 1987-style market crash . odds we get here : very good . roubini says that we 'll likely socialize the losses ,  effectively nationalizing the mortgages or the banks .  it would be , he told me ,  like northern rock -lrb- the large bank in england that was recently taken over by the british government -rrb- times three .  he thinks the stock market will head south throughout the year as fears about a severe recession are confirmed . • defconomy two . how you 'll know we 're here : most forms of credit -lrb- both to consumers and businesses -rrb- become virtually nonexistent . that results in a  vicious circle  of additional write-downs , stock market losses , and bank collapses , which leads to even less credit being available . odds we get here : good . roubini says that credit conditions are becoming worse everyday across a variety of markets and wo n't be getting better anytime soon . without extra credit available , people might have to actually -lrb- gasp ! -rrb- live within their means . • defconomy one . how you 'll know we 're here : welcome back to 1929 . a full economic meltdown results in a complete failure of the underlying financial system . what will be known to future generations as  the greater depression  has arrived . odds we get here : not likely . roubini believes that this will be a  very painful and severe recession  that could last for 18 months or more , but it will be more like 1981 than 1929 . families may be eating soup again , but at least it 'll be in their own kitchens . now , do i think any of what you just read will happen ? i have no idea , and that 's exactly the problem . i 'm not an economist or a stockbroker ; i 'm just a guy trying to make the best decisions i can , and picking the brains of real experts helps me do that . but i do know one thing for sure : depressions are n't advertised in advance . last time around we went from the roaring '20s to bread lines in a matter of just a few years . anyone who says that ca n't happen again either does n't know history , does n't understand how interconnected the world 's economies have become , or is lying to you . while that does n't mean you should panic , it does mean you should prepare -- something my grandfather would 've done a long time ago . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
