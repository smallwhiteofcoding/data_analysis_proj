{"text": "editor 's note : cnn.com 's wayne drash writes about his maniacal love for university of memphis basketball . memphis , north carolina , ucla and kansas play in the final four this weekend . drash says the memphis team can help heal the city 's old wounds . cnn.com 's wayne drash , left , says he 's been hooked on university of memphis basketball since he was a kid . atlanta , georgia my love for university of memphis basketball is completely irrational . i never went to school there and have no affiliation with the university . but i bleed tiger blue . my dad used to take my brothers and me to memphis games as a kid , and i 've been hooked ever since . we once bought tickets from a scalper for six bucks apiece against arch-rival the university of louisville in the 1980s . my dad complained we paid too much . but then we moved in seventh grade . i became an even bigger fan after we left the city . i 'd huddle over my am radio , hooked up with a coat hanger wrapped in aluminum foil as an antenna . more than 350 miles away , i managed to pick up the then-memphis state games through the crackle and static of the radio . memphis basketball was my only way to remain connected to my youth and the city that i loved . that was 1985 , the last time memphis made the final four . is your team in the final four ? send your ireport celebratory photos . back then , memphis was led by a phenom named keith lee . he was best known for a sweet baseline jumper as soft as the nylon nets he swished . he was also known for his giant afro . he was listed as 6 feet 10 inches . the joke was if you included his wild hairdo , he was 7-4 . when my parents were away at work , sometimes i 'd sneak into my mom 's cabinet , steal her mousse and then put it in my hair . then this white kid would go out back and shoot hoops for hours , hair sticking straight out like i stuck my finger in a socket . it was the only way i could be like lee , my hero and idol . back then , memphians would rank lee right up there with elvis presley as the city 's most popular icons . many still do . and that 's the thing about tiger basketball . in a place where race has often divided so much of it , memphis basketball has helped unite the city . as a boy , white and black kids would crowd the basketball court at tiger games to try to snatch the players ' sweatbands as they raced into the locker room . up until i graduated from high school , the sweatbands of phillip  doom  haynes and baskerville  batman  holmes sat on my shelf in my room . like a fan of any team , there have been good and bad times over the years . but sometimes the pain of being a tiger fan is that much greater . tragedy and heartbreak are part of it , such as when holmes killed his girlfriend and then himself in 1997 . other players , such as aaron price and a. maceo battle , have died far too young along the way , furthering the pain of being a fan . larry finch -- who as a black player brought together the city and took memphis to its only national championship game in 1973 , and later became one of its greatest coaches -- has lived much of the past few years in a rehabilitation center after suffering severe strokes . in some ways , that 's what makes memphis basketball so special . memphis players embody the real life of so many americans , many faced with extreme hard times . some succeed ; some do n't . others , such as finch , keep on fighting . i do n't find it an accident that memphis is now seeking history the same week of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the rev. martin luther king jr.  i think dr. king would find this a source of joy ,  the rev. jesse jackson told the team this week , according to the memphis commercial appeal newspaper . a city that has seen so much pain , so much heartache , has something huge to celebrate -- all revolving around young college kids and a bouncy orange ball . the adage is that sports often have the ability to transcend the moment . this is one of those times . to get to the championship game monday night , memphis must first get past ucla , the same team that defeated it in that 1973 title game . while much of the rest of the nation has the team pegged to lose , the tigers -- for one shining moment -- have a chance to do something really special . they 'd have it no other way . as for me ? i wo n't be listening on my old radio , but this weekend i might just try sporting that ` do like keith lee . the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of the writers . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
