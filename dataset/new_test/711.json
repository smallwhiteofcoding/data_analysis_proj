{"text": "london , england nothing says true love like releasing a caged butterfly , do n't you think ? wayne rooney and coleen mcloughlin are to be paid $ 5 million for the picture rights to their wedding . the butterflies are reported to be the piece-de-resistance of england 's most anticipated celebrity wedding of the year . wayne rooney , the best english footballer of his generation , and coleen mcloughlin , his high school sweetheart , were to marry in an estimated $ 10 million ceremony in italy thursday . as they kiss , guests are apparently meant to open boxes and release the butterflies . the moment has been pilloried widely in the british media , tacky and over the top they all think , but is it just sour grapes ? it has been a long and , at times , bumpy road for the couple to the altar . one littered with fierce criticism from the british press , which has enjoyed nothing more than lampooning rooney and mcloughlin for being ` common . ' the daily mail once even asked :  is this britain 's ghastliest couple ?  rooney has been dubbed  shrek  and  mr potato head  due to his looks and his background as the son of a school dinner lady who grew up on a council estate is often referred to in a disparaging way . mcloughlin , meanwhile , has been subjected to page upon page of bitter stories about her weight , shopping sprees and her lack of closeness to victoria beckham . there has also been fierce criticism over the fact she has managed to become a millionaire in her own right . it 's all down to rooney apparently , and nothing to do with her appearing to be quite a decent person , who did well at school and has cleverly managed to parlay some of her fame into various media and advertising projects . anyone who has seen her television show -- coleen 's real women -- can see she is a decent , bubbly person , who is very good at putting people at ease . much to the media 's fury , the couple have sold the rights to cover the wedding to ok magazine for a record $ 5 million . however they 're not pocketing all the cash themselves , with an undisclosed sum from the fee to be donated to the claire house children 's hospice in cheshire -- where mcloughlin 's disabled foster sister rosie is cared for . the queen 's grandson , peter phillips and his bride autumn kelly , recently received $ 1m from hello magazine to cover their wedding but they did n't receive an eighth of the opprobrium now directed at the more generous , but lower class , rooney and mcloughlin . moreover , in lieu of presents , rooney and mcloughlin have also asked guests to donate money to the alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool . the wedding might be over the top , with a private yacht and luxury jet for guests -lrb- they are covering the guests ' costs -rrb- , expensive plonk and a $ 200,000 wedding dress , but at least the couple have worked hard for what they have . their success despite a working-class background appears to be the greatest source of frustration for critics . it 's just not on that someone who was n't born into privilege and did n't go to a posh school can enjoy their wealth . that would be ugly . if anything , the couple 's relationship and success is a triumph over adversity . they have known each other since mcloughlin was 12 , but she spent two years fending off rooney 's entreaties to go out on a date . he finally got his chance when he saw her struggling to fix a broken bicycle chain . he rode over to help , popped the question again and got a yes . surely they should be congratulated for creating their own modern fairytale complete with butterflies ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .", "summary": "no summary"}
