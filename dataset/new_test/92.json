{"text": "st. petersburg , florida the acrimony from the republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the cnn/youtube gop presidential debate wednesday . the debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month . with five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season , the republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all , trying to differentiate their views on immigration , the iraq war , abortion , gun control and even whether they believed every word in the bible was true . unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on democratic front-runner hillary clinton , wednesday night 's attacks were launched at each other . former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov. mitt romney traded jabs over illegal immigration , something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month . romney attacked giuliani 's record , saying that as mayor , he promoted illegal immigration . and giuliani shot back , accusing romney of having a  sanctuary mansion  at his own home . watch the debate format produce raw moments   in his case , there were six sanctuary cities . he did nothing about them . there was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home , illegal immigrants were being employed ,  giuliani said . romney denied giuliani 's allegation , and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other . in his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party , romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , who has been rising in the polls . rep. tom tancredo , who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration , seemed delighted with the give and take , saying the other candidates were trying to  out-tancredo  him . huckabee drew one of the night 's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the internal revenue service .  most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging , and there 's a reason why ,  he said . sen. john mccain , freshly back from a visit to iraq over thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates , and rep. ron paul , the most anti-war of the candidates , tangled on two occasions over the iraq war . did youtubers get their questions answered ?  asked which government programs they would cut , paul said bringing the troops home from iraq would save  a trillion dollars .  mccain said :  it 's that kind of isolationism that caused world war ii ,  which drew some hoots from the crowd . watch mccain , paul spar on iraq  paul replied :  the real question you have to ask is why do i get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel ?  a retired brigadier general , keith kerr , who is gay , asked candidates if they thought u.s. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops . cnn later learned that a june media release from the campaign of democratic front-runner clinton listed kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters . watch kerr deny that the clinton campaign influenced his question  david bohrman , cnn senior vice president and executive producer of the debate , said ,  we regret this incident . cnn would not have used the general 's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate .  political ticker . kerr told cnn after the debate that he has not worked for the clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself . kerr also said he is a member of the log cabin republicans , a national gay and lesbian republican grass-roots organization . prior to the debate , cnn had verified kerr 's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate . in a section of the debate about gun ownership rights , three of the gop presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns : mccain , giuliani and romney . former tennessee sen. fred thompson quipped ,  i own a couple of guns -- but i 'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are .  watch the candidates address gun control  the debate turned personal when a viewer , holding the bible , asked :  do you believe every word of this book ? and i mean specifically , this book that i am holding in my hand .  huckabee , a baptist minister , said ,  sure , i believe the bible is exactly what it is .  giuliani said he believes the bible , but not  literally true in every respect .  after that , romney stammered a bit when moderator anderson cooper asked him if he believed every word . watch the candidates get personal about the bible   yeah , the bible is the word of god . ... i might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word , but i read the bible and i believe the bible is the word of god ,  romney said . when asked about abortion , romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman 's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of massachusetts .  if people in this country are looking for someone who 's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they 're ever wrong , they 're going to have to find somebody else . on abortion , i was wrong ,  he said . his remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by thompson 's campaign , which included a clip of romney expressing support for roe vs. wade during a 1994 debate against sen. ted kennedy . when asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal , paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government .  we do n't need a federal abortion police , that 's the last thing we need ,  paul said . he added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities . on the issues of taxes , thompson said he 'd  never met a tax he liked .   i 've got a tax-cut bill on the table . but i do n't do pledges to anybody but the american people ,  he said . his response was met by a  go , fred , go !  from a member of the audience . on the issue of trade with china , rep. duncan hunter said china is  cheating on trade ... and it 's in the interest of the united states to stop china 's cheating . buy american this christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job .  the candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the youtube web site , just as democratic white house candidates did in july . the debate was the first time the gop candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month . cnn 's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the gop debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the democrats ' debate . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
