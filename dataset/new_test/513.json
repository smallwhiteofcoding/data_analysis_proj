 the soldier asks .  i raped one , sir ,  the man responds .  what was her name ?   ahlam ,  he says . ahlam was a university student in the predominantly shiite city of basra . the detainee said the gang he was in kidnapped her as she was leaving the university , heading home .  they forced me , and i killed her with a machine gun , sir ,  he says . the suspect , who is unshaven and appears to be in his 20s or 30s , was arrested by iraq security forces after they retook most of basra in april . cnn was shown what authorities say was his first confession . on it are the names of 15 girls whom he admitted kidnapping , raping and killing . the youngest girl on the list was just 9 years old . basra turned into a battleground between warring shiite factions vying for control of the country 's oil-rich south after the u.s.-led invasion of iraq in 2003 . basra 's streets teemed with shiite militias armed with weapons , mostly from iran , according to the iraqi forces and the u.s. military . watch a mom describe her three sons killed  for four years after the invasion , basra was under the control of british forces , but they were unable to contain the violence and withdrew in september last year . women bore the brunt of the militias ' extremist ideologies . the militants spray-painted threats on walls across basra , warning women to wear headscarves and not to wear makeup . women were sometimes executed for the vague charge of doing something  un-islamic .  in the wasteland on the outskirts of basra , dotted with rundown homes , the stench of death mixes with the sewage . local residents told the iraqi army that executions often take place in the area , particularly for women , sometimes killed for something as seemingly innocuous as wearing jeans . militias implemented their own laws with abandon , threatening stores for displaying mannequins with bare shoulders or for selling western music . many store owners are still too frightened to speak publicly . but the horrors of militia rule are now surfacing as some residents begin to feel more comfortable speaking out . inside her rundown home , sabriya 's watery eyes peer out from under her robe . she points to the first photo of one of her sons on the wall .  this one was killed because he was drinking ,  she says . she draws her finger across her neck and gestures at the next photo .  this one was slaughtered for his car .   this one the same ,  she adds , looking at the third . her three sons , her daughter and her sister were all killed by the hard-line militia . her sister was slaughtered because she was a single woman living alone , sabriya says .  they came in at night and put a pillow on her face and shot her in the head ,  she says . sabriya lives on what was once dubbed  murder street  for the daily killings that happened there last year . on the day cnn visited , dozens of young men sat where there used to be piles of bodies . sheik maktouf al-maraiyani shudders at the memory .  every day , we would find 10 or 15 of our men killed ,  he says , adding sorrowfully  one of them was my son .  his son was 25 years old . now ,  murder street  is part of a citywide effort to get basra back on its feet . in a project funded by u.s. forces , sheikh maktouf and others are being paid $ 20 a day and upwards to clean up trash . watch the transformation of ` murder street '  basra may be part of the country 's oil-rich south , but it wallows in its own sewage and trash . the stench of filth is impossible to escape . the effort also helps with the massive unemployment plaguing the city . british forces officially handed over responsibility of basra to iraqi forces in december .  the situation was so bad because the security forces were controlled by the militias ,  says brig. gen. aziz al-swady , who commands the 14th iraq army divison . to help curb the violence , british troops have returned to the city , adopting the u.s. approach of embedding with iraqi units as advisers . the iraqi prime minister also has flooded the city with additional troops , bringing in soldiers from western iraq along with their american advisers .  now the citizens have started to trust the iraqi security forces ,  said al-swady . the biggest difference is that residents are starting to leave their homes , something unthinkable just a few months ago . at one of the parks in the city this past weekend , a father named al ` aa was out with his three young children and his wife .  it 's the first time that we have dared to come here in two years ,  he said . the park was once often used for executions . everyone , residents and soldiers alike , knows the battle for basra is not over . militias still lurk in the shadows , and the security gains may not last without economic gains .  the most important thing , our government must focus on finding jobs , different jobs for these people ,  says maj. gen. tariq al-azawi .", "summary": "no summary"}
