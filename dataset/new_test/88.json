{"text": "london , england there are some circuits that are cornerstones of the formula 1 calendar : the monacos and silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers . then there are the newer circuits -- malaysia and bahrain , for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins . fuji speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view . next week they have something completely new to contend with : a track that has yet to see a single f1 team put in a single lap . the japan grand prix is to return to the fuji speedway , a circuit that has n't seen an f1 race since 1977 -lrb- though now with a substantially different track layout -rrb- . the fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games . the old fuji speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game pole position -lrb- released by namco in japan and atari in the rest of the world -rrb- . the most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of mount fuji , japan 's tallest mountain , looming in the distance . though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies . the suzuka track -- which had held japanese grands prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike , but for this year and the next the japanese grand prix will be held at fuji . however an announcement by formula one management -lrb- fom -rrb- this month revealed that suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the japanese grand prix alternating yearly between fuji and suzuka after that . behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with f1 connections -- honda owns suzuka , toyota owns fuji . toyota is a relative newcomer to f1 but , having this year surpassed general motors as the world 's number one automobile manufacturer , and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock -lrb- a position that has n't been reflected in sporting success -rrb- , it is not without clout . the redesign of the fuji track was carried out by hermann tilke in 2003 . tilke , a german architect redesigned a number of f1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including malaysia , istanbul , bahrain and shanghai , and the tracks for 2008 's debut grands prix in singapore and valencia . so how do f1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as fuji without data from previous races to fall back on ? the answer lies with computer simulation . computer-aided design -lrb- cad -rrb- is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars . every bend , every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself . despite never having raced on the circuit , the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual fuji speedway for some time . bmw sauber 's simulation experts received cad data from the japanese race organizers late last year . and when their cars arrive at fuji for testing next week , their race set-up should be close to optimum . the circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments . the radius of each individual segment was measured , allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line -lrb- the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance -rrb- . then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated . the slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car .  in order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend , we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels , gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance ,  says willy rampf , technical director of the bmw sauber f1 team . dieter glass , chief race and test engineer with toyota f1 explains : .  you start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit . once you know that , you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce , before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions .  getting a bit closer to the weekend , you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy . this prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track , like the degradation of the two bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time . if you have more fuel in the car , this affects your lap time , but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried .  one peculiarity of the fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight , which at 1.475 km -lrb- 0.916 miles -rrb- will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but , after the straight the track is relatively twisty . the teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight , and the best grip decelerating into the bends .  you have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip ,  says glass ,  and as always you want good grip in general , but you have to balance that with the long straight , where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed .  the testing may be virtual , but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair 's breadth away from real world eventualities : .  our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values ,  says rampf . not that everything can be predicted :  i think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race ,  continues glass .  many incidents can happen , which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
