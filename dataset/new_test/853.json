{"text": "u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi reversed her opposition to a vote on offshore drilling on  larry king live  on monday night , saying she would consider a vote if it were part of a larger energy package . u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi urges the release of oil from strategic reserves as a way to bring down gas prices . pelosi and fellow house democrats have staunchly opposed republicans ' request for a vote on the drilling . some republicans stayed in chambers after congress adjourned for the session , making speeches on energy policies , in an attempt to get democrats to come back for a vote . reacting to pelosi 's remarks , house minority leader john boehner , r-ohio , said the speaker should call the house of representatives back from its summer recess immediately if she is sincere about a vote on off-shore drilling .  our message to speaker pelosi is very simple : we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now , and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the american people the relief they expect and deserve ,  boehner said .  if you meant what you said last night , we welcome you and your democratic colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on american energy .  on monday night , pelosi said the vote would need to be part of a larger discussion that would include investing in renewable energy resources and releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve . those options would help bring both immediate and long-lasting solutions to the energy crisis , she said . in her interview with king , pelosi talked about what the government and country needs to do to avert the energy crisis and quickly bring down gas prices . the following is an edited version of the interview : . larry king : ok , madam speaker , author of  know your power ,  why do n't you bring -lsb- congress -rsb- back ? speaker nancy pelosi : well , it 's interesting to hear sen. -lsb- john -rsb- mccain talk about bringing congress back . he was n't even in congress this last session when we really had two very important bills on energy -- one to give tax credit for wind , solar and other renewable resources , and another about hybrid cars and the rest . so he was n't in to vote when were in session and now he 's saying call it back in . and then one of the others said to the president , call congress back in . and the president said no . the president said no . but the point is this : the american people are suffering . we have to do what is best for them . how do we bring down the prices at the pump ? we have said to the president , the fastest way to do this if in 10 days the price can come down if you will free our oil . over 700 million barrels of oil the president is sitting on of the strategic petroleum reserve . no. 1 , free our oil . no. 2 , they want to drill . if they want to drill , we have 68 million acres in the lower 48 that they can drill in that are permitted and all the rest . three , stop the speculation . four , renew -- invest in renewable energy resources , which will bring a faster return than drilling offshore , which will take 10 years and produce 2 cents ' reduction in 10 years off the price at the pump . and then use natural gas . natural gas is so plentiful . it 's better for the environment , and it is cheaper . so there are things that congress can do , and we have voted on this over and over again . but the republicans and the president have resisted . instead , they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas . well , we can do that . we can have a vote on that . but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them . king : would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling ? pelosi : i would not . it depends how the drilling is put forth . but i do n't -- that is not excluded , let me say it that way . it depends how that is proposed , if the safeguards are there . now , mind you , 68 million acres -- 10 million more acres in alaska where they can drill . but if there 's -- if we can get some great things , in terms of renewable energy resources : a renewable electricity standard , wind , solar , biofuels and the rest in that context , because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling , you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels , and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment , cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming . and the consumer is our first responsibility . the american taxpayer owns this oil offshore , by the way . let me make this one final point . this oil is owned by the american taxpayers . the oil companies drill . we give them money to drill there . but we get very little in return . so i think as we have this debate , which is a very healthy one to have and i welcome it ; we have to review and realign the relationship between our oil , big oil 's profits and what it means to the consumer and the taxpayer . king : do you expect -- do you suspect the oil companies of having a lot of clout here , influence over the republicans ? pelosi : of course . yes , they rule . and that 's what we 'll find out . king : they rule ? pelosi : when we have this vote , when we really define it and where the choice is clear to the american people -- i mean , do you know what -- exxon mobil , their last quarter , their profits were historic . last year , they were historic . they outdid themselves this year already in this second quarter . and they insist that we pay them to drill . they need an incentive to drill in order to make over $ 11 billion in one quarter . and it just does n't make sense . we should be using that money to invest in renewable resources , tax credit for wind and solar , etc. and invest in the technologies that will develop the battery and the rest , instead of giving big oil more profits . king : do you expect to get a big enough majority in the senate and house for the democrats to overcome anything and get through your proposals ? pelosi : well , i hope we can do some of it before we even leave this session . i think we can -- hopefully , we can do something before december . i will not subscribe to a hoax on the american people that if you drill offshore , you 're going to bring down the price at the pump . even the president says that 's not true . ten years , two cents -- we 're saying 10 days , bring down the price , if the president would free our oil from the strategic petroleum -lsb- reserve -rsb- -- from our stockpile -- owned by the taxpayers , purchased by the taxpayers . in the next election , i know that we will strengthen our majorities , increase their numbers , and we will have a democratic president in the white house , and we will be able to address more fully really what i think is the challenge to our generation -- energy security and global warming .", "summary": "no summary"}
