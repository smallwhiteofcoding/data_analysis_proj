{"text": "price of gas got you crying at the pump ? is it eating into your household budget ? well , get used to it . gas in california , the second worst state , hits $ 4.59 per gallon for regular unleaded in this july 14 photo . that 's the word on the streets as the price of a gallon of gasoline soars to record highs . with regional differentials pushing the price much higher in some places , drivers and small-business owners are finding it hard to cope . but which states ' motorists get the best deal , and in which states do drivers pay the most to fill-up ? here come the numbers . alaska has the highest gas prices in the nation , with a gallon of regular gasoline at $ 4.623 , followed by california at $ 4.583 as of june 30 . hawaii , connecticut and washington make up the top five states with highest prices , with new york and d.c. not far behind at $ 4.292 and $ 4.160 respectively . best states to buy gas ? missouri comes out top at $ 3.862 for a gallon of regular , followed by oklahoma at $ 3.866 , south carolina , mississippi and arkansas . iowa , kansas and alabama are next in line . aol autos : cars with 30 + mpg for $ 300 or less per month . past prices . we use the term ` best states to buy gas ' with this caveat : back in june 2004 , gas hovered at around $ 1.74 a gallon , according to figures from gasbuddy.com . geoff sundstrom , aaa 's fuel price analyst , said the primary reasons for rising fuel prices are an increase in demand for petroleum products across the globe and a need for investment in refining infrastructure .  right now , it is almost impossible to know where oil and gas prices will be in six months to a year ,  he said .  it 's easy to assume that the world economy will continue to grow , we are very clearly at risk of an economic downturn and perhaps a severe economic downturn which could influence the demand side to the point where oil and gas prices may drop .  in 10 to 20 years out , oil and gasoline will continue to be more expensive . but given what 's happening in the markets right now , there is some potential that -lsb- the -rsb- demands side of the equation could fall off a cliff .  aol autos : consumer reports on best fuel-efficient used cars . why so expensive in california ? marie montgomery , spokeswoman for the automobile club of southern california , says the primary reason behind the high price of gas in california is  market segmentation ,  a marketing term that basically means california -lrb- along with many other states -rrb- has developed a  boutique blend  of fuel in a bid to uphold environmental or ecological standards . in california 's case , this blend helps clear the state 's notorious smog .  we ca n't use gas they made for iowa . we use a special blend with additives in it , an ethanol mix ,  montgomery said .  when you do that , you can only use refineries that make that gas -lsb- mix -rsb- . the refineries in california are a major supplier , but , when prices are high and there 's not another supplier , we have to go where they make that mix .  she pointed out that refineries in oregon and washington produce the gas product , and there is a pipeline to alaska , but that the only other options are shipping in the blend from elsewhere in the nation or asia , which is not cost-efficient .  people have to figure out how to deal with this on a long-term basis . we 've been telling motorists to carpool and here we are in summer , and prices have barely come down ,  she said .  usually we 're about a month into a downturn , it 's cyclical : prices go up in spring and spike in may , which is n't happening this year . prices may not come down a lot .  less misery in missouri . michael right , vice president of public affairs for aaa missouri , said his state is usually among the top three in terms of low gas prices . a contributing factor , he said , is that the state 's per-gallon tax rate is the lowest in the nation . he said that most , if not all , states impose a tax on gasoline but few are as low as the 17 cents a gallon missouri levies . and missouri , unlike most other states , does n't impose a sales tax on top of that . the state also benefits from good distribution via a crisscrossing network of pipelines which can , unusually , result in cheaper gas in rural areas than in major cities . the reason for this is the three types of gas used in the state . st louis primarily uses reformulated gasoline . conventional gas is sold in rural areas , and kansas city uses low rvp -lrb- or low-emission -rrb- gasoline . reformulated costs more than conventional gas , hence the higher cost in cities .  in illinois , it 's not unusual to save 15 cents a gallon by crossing the river ,  right said . aol autos : best hybrid suvs . effects on station owners and operators . while the effects of soaring pump prices on consumers are well documented , owners and operators of service stations nationwide are also feeling the pain acutely . dennis decota , the executive director of the 135-year-old california service station and automotive repair association and owner of a service station in marin county , california , said high prices are  extremely detrimental to business people . what it does is creates a financial hardship on customers , -lsb- leading to -rsb- less foot traffic to stores or repair facilities . it puts a strain on entire businesses ; unbranded service stations are really at the end of their rope .  independent , unbranded stations have one retail philosophy : offer the best price . they rely on oversupply by refineries which they buy at wholesale prices and sell cheaper than the branded competition , like shell or exxon -lrb- which have both announced they are quitting the service-station industry -rrb- . but in the past six months , that supply curve has become inverted , which means owner-operators are paying more -- $ 37,000 a truckload -- for their gas than branded outlets . decota noted some are losing as much as 15 cents a gallon on every sale . it 's a hard time for the industry , he said . the blame for high oil prices is pretty evenly spread , decota said . he did , however , point out that as a result of higher gas prices , california brought in $ 4.4 billion last year in sales taxes from its monthly sales of 1,300,000,000 gallons . in 2002 , when gas prices averaged about $ 1.71 a gallon , it brought in $ 1.7 billion . decota advocates boosting refinery capacity from its current level of 88 percent to about 92 percent . he said refineries  have their hands on the spigot . there is no shortage of crude . but if the government stepped up refinery capacity , that would put enough downward pressure to create competition among refineries . and my guys are going under .  aol autos : 10 hot small cars .", "summary": "no summary"}
