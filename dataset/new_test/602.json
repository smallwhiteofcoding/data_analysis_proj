{"text": "zimbabwe 's capital of harare was quiet saturday night after polls began closing for elections that will decide the future of longtime president robert mugabe . zimbabwean president robert mugabe campaigns in the capital of harare last week . results were not expected until sunday . the main opposition party , movement for democratic change , alleged widespread irregularities and promised to release its own election results , defying a government order . critics of the government have predicted that the elections will be rigged or marred by fraud , though the government has promised that they will be  free and fair .  at a news conference in harare , movement for democratic change secretary-general tenda biti said that some of the party 's agents have been chased away from polling stations . the party also said the zimbabwe electoral commission claimed to have lost the accreditation for agents at 19 stations and refused to let them in . biti said there was a  massive  deployment of soldiers and police at most stations . journalists inside the country reported a heavy presence of the army and police but disagreed with biti 's description of it as  massive .  police said they were investigating the bombing of a house in harare belonging to a parliamentarian candidate from mugabe 's ruling zanu-pf party . the bombing happened early saturday , and it was not immediately clear whether it was connected to the elections , police said . no one was inside the home at the time . the zimbabwean government has denied cnn and other international news organizations permission to enter the country to report on the elections . read about reporting on the elections . the elections are posing one of the toughest challenges to mugabe 's 28-year rule . two candidates , both from different factions of the opposition party , stand a good chance of unseating him . one opposition contender is movement for democratic change founder morgan tsvangirai , who fought hotly contested challenges against the president in 2000 , 2002 and 2005 . the other is mugabe 's former finance minister , simba makoni . he was a member of the zanu-pf party until he announced his bid to unseat mugabe and the party kicked him out . voter turnout was high after the polls opened at 7 a.m. -lrb- 1 a.m. et -rrb- , journalists reported , but it tapered off throughout the day . shortly before polls closed at 7 p.m. -lrb- 1 p.m. et -rrb- ,  there was a rush of people to put in their last-minute votes  in some places , media rights activist reyhana masters said . biti also said police were assisting many voters in casting ballots . the opposition has spoken out against  assistance  in the voting booth , calling it an intimidation tactic , but mugabe passed a presidential decree this week that said police could help those voters who are elderly or infirm . watch zimbabweans worry their vote wo n't count  the government has warned the opposition not to release its own election results , saying that doing so is the role of the electoral commission and could spark violence of the kind seen in kenya after elections there late last year . some zimbabweans reported irregularities in saturday 's voting . eddie matsangaise of the zimbabwe exile forum said he had heard that the names of long-dead white colonialist leaders were on voter lists , but voters who thought they were registered were turned away . iden wetherell , editor of the newspaper zimbabwe independent , said the opposition had found large numbers of voters registered at one address where there is n't a building . voter confusion was also a problem . the elections are not just for president but also for parliamentary , senate and local council seats , meaning voters have to cast a number of ballots in a limited amount of time . limited voter education means many registered voters were not told which ward to go to and may turn up at the wrong polling stations . watch claims of dead voters still on the rolls  the absence of international media and independent observers has heightened critics ' concerns . the united states this week warned of a possible unfair election , and new york-based human rights watch warned this month that the elections were likely to be  deeply flawed .  human rights watch said in a report that zimbabwe 's electoral commission is partisan toward zanu-pf and lacks both expertise and resources to run the elections properly . an mdc official said this week that leaked correspondence from the electoral commission showed it had asked for 3.3 million more ballots than there are registered voters , including 250,000 extra postal ballots for soldiers and police . tenda biti , the opposition 's secretary-general , said it was an indication of fraud . a hero of the country 's civil war against the white rhodesian government , mugabe became the country 's first black prime minister in 1980 . but nearly three decades later , he has consolidated his rule over all aspects of zimbabwean life , and the country does not appear better for it . his country was once revered for offering its citizens some of the best education and health care in africa , but now , schooling is a luxury and zimbabwe has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world . zimbabwe was once known as the breadbasket of southern africa , but now it is difficult to get even basic food supplies . inflation has skyrocketed to more than 100,000 percent while food production and agricultural exports have dropped drastically . watch reasons for meltdown of zimbabwe 's economy  part of the economic freefall is traced to mugabe 's land redistribution policies , including his controversial seizure of commercially white-owned farms in 2000 . mugabe gave the land to black zimbabweans who he said were cheated under colonialist rule , and white farmers who resisted were jailed . in 2005 , mugabe launched operation clean out the trash , in which he razed slum areas across the country . mugabe denies mismanagement and blames his country 's woes on the west , saying that sanctions have harmed the economy . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's robyn curnow in beitbridge , south africa , contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
