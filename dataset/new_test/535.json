{"text": "his name is  average  and the story of his desperate flight from the wreckage of president robert mugabe 's zimbabwe is an increasingly common one . math teacher mawise gumba fled zimbabwe and found his qualifications mean little as a refugee . the tall 34-year-old , slouching exhausted in a johannesburg church that has become a de facto transit camp , is one man in a tide of migrants washing up in south africa .  there is nothing for me there in our country any more . i had no job and i could not afford anything . even when i was working life was tough ,  he said .  it 's hard for everyone ... i thought it was better for me here ,  said the former store clerk , whose dusty jeans and boots tell of a long and difficult journey . the tale told by average -- whose name is not unusual in zimbabwe -- is depressingly familiar to a people who have watched their once prosperous land spiral into economic disaster . when mugabe 's government , facing inflation of close to 5,000 percent , ordered companies to halve prices of basic goods and services a month ago -- effectively demanding that they operate at a loss -- average lost his job as the supermarket chain he worked for cut staff . facing the prospect of homelessness and hunger in his own country , he joined the estimated 4,000 zimbabweans who head south to south africa , most of them illegally , every day . mugabe , 83 and in power since the country 's independence from britain in 1980 , has been accused of running zimbabwe 's economy into the ground while implementing a draconian crackdown aimed at keeping power . his decision to launch violent seizures of white-owned farms seven years ago is partly blamed for soaring unemployment and the highest inflation rate in the world . average scraped together his last salary , some money he made from trading sugar bought at a discount from the supermarket where he worked , and funds borrowed from friends to secure a visitor 's visa and bus ticket to johannesburg . a friend who promised to meet him on arrival failed to show up , leaving him stranded without a place to sleep . on wednesday evening he walked into the central methodist church in downtown johannesburg and joined a long queue of people waiting for shelter and food . the church 's homeless shelter has become a virtual refugee camp for 800-900 zimbabweans and a smaller number of migrants from other countries .  over the past three years , and more so over the past couple of months , i have noted an exponential increase in the number of people we have from zimbabwe ,  bishop paul verryn said . outside his office the line of people waiting for help grew . many of the new arrivals were asleep in their seats .  we offer them a place off the streets , where they are protected and have warmth from the inclement streets of johannesburg ,  verryn said . at sunset the refugees crowd into the building and lay out reeking blankets .  people just sleep anywhere they can find a space to sleep . some people sleep on the steps here , in the corridors and others in the foyer and in the meeting rooms ,  said 27-year-old walter rusike from harare . the commerce graduate and his wife and two children share a meeting room with other families and have been at the shelter for four months . average said he hoped to get accommodation for a few days until he finds his friend , work or both .  i have a diploma in stores management and store control , a certificate in security and a driver 's licence . i think maybe i will be able to find some work with my qualifications . anything will be better than the situation i was in ,  he says . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .", "summary": "no summary"}
