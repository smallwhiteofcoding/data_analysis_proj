{"text": "it 's all tied up in texas . sens. hillary clinton and barack obama are running a tight race in texas . a new cnn/opinion research corp. poll suggests the battle for the democratic presidential nomination between sens. hillary clinton of new york and barack obama of illinois is a statistical dead heat in texas , which holds primaries march 4 . in the survey , out monday , 50 percent of likely democratic primary voters support clinton as their choice for the party 's nominee , with 48 percent backing obama . but taking into account the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus 4 1/2 percentage points for democratic respondents , the race is a virtual tie . watch democrats target texas .  two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even . map : national and state polling .  one reason the race appears to be tight is that texas democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options ,  says cnn polling director keating holland .  likely democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination , and they do n't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues .  roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly , those people are splitting roughly equally between clinton and obama .  many political strategists and analysts consider texas and ohio -- which also holds a march 4 primary -- must-win states for clinton . obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates , 193 of which are at stake in texas . the new survey indicates arizona sen. john mccain is the clear favorite for the republican presidential nomination . among republicans , 55 percent of likely texas gop primary voters support mccain as their choice for nominee . thirty-two percent back former arkansas gov. mike huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former libertarian standard-bearer ron paul . the poll 's sampling error for republican respondents is 4 percentage points . the cnn/opinion research corp. poll was conducted by telephone from friday through sunday . pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in texas , including 553 likely republican primary voters and 529 likely democratic primary voters . mccain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity . the poll was released on the same day the only living former republican president -- george herbert walker bush , the current president 's father -- endorsed mccain at an event in houston . watch mccain get a big boost  but mccain has had trouble winning conservative voters . just last week , mccain lost the conservative vote to huckabee in the virginia primary , according to exit polls . the new survey , though , suggests mccain may have better luck in texas .  it looks like mccain has made some inroads with conservative republicans ,  holland said .  mccain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the gop primary . the mccain campaign probably wishes that number were higher , but it does mean that a mccain victory in texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents , as has happened in several states in the past few weeks .  texas democrats and republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues , but the poll suggests they do agree on what 's the most important issue . thirty-five percent of democrats and an equal number of republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president . the second most important issue for democrats was health care , at 23 percent , followed by the war in iraq at 22 percent , illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent . nineteen percent of republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue , putting it in second place , followed by the war in iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent . sixty percent of republicans say they 'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing . that number climbs to 76 percent for democrats . likely democratic primary voters view clinton and obama on roughly equal terms . seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if clinton were the nominee ; an equal number feel the same way about obama . seventy-nine percent say it 's likely clinton can win the nomination ; 82 percent say the same about obama . the two candidates are essentially tied on immigration , iraq and the economy , but clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
