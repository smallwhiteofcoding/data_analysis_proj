{"text": "baghdad , iraq the women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used . they have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $ 8 a day . suha , 37 , is a mother of three . she says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home .  people should n't criticize women , or talk badly about them ,  says 37-year-old suha as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves .  they all say we have lost our way , but they never ask why we had to take this path .  a mother of three , she wears light makeup , a gold pendant of iraq around her neck , and an unexpected air of elegance about her .  i do n't have money to take my kid to the doctor . i have to do anything that i can to preserve my child , because i am a mother ,  she says , explaining why she prostitutes herself . anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks .  no matter what else i may be , no matter how off the path i may be , i am a mother !  watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to  save my child   her clasped hands clench and unclench nervously . suha 's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away . so does karima 's family .  at the start i was cleaning homes , but i was n't making much . no matter how hard i worked it just was n't enough ,  she says . karima , clad in all black , adds ,  my husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing .  she has five children , ages 8 to 17 . her eldest son could work , but she 's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets , preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child . she was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office .  they took advantage of me ,  she says softly .  at first i rejected it , but then i realized i have to do it .  both suha and karima have clients that call them a couple times a week . other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients . or they flag down vehicles . prostitution is a choice more and more iraqi women are making just to survive .  it 's increasing ,  suha says .  i found this ` thing ' through my friend , and i have another friend in the same predicament as mine . because of the circumstance , she is forced to do such things .  violence , increased cost of living , and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options , according to humanitarian workers .  at this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive ,  says yanar mohammed , head and founder of the organization for women 's freedom in iraq .  it 's a taboo that no one is speaking about .  she adds ,  there is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies , their souls and they lost it all . it crushes us to see them , but we have to work on it and that 's why we started our team of women activists .  her team pounds the streets of baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward .  most of the women that we find at hospitals -lsb- who -rsb- have tried to commit suicide  have been involved in prostitution , said basma rahim , a member of mohammed 's team . the team 's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to iraq 's political parties -- to have them , as mohammed puts it ,  come tell us what -lsb- they -rsb- are ... going to do about this .  rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children :  she has sex while her three children are in the room , but she makes them stand in separate corners .  according to rahim and mohammed , most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in iraq .  they took this path but they are not pleased ,  rahim says . karima says when she sees her children with food on the table , she is able to convince herself that it 's worth it .  everything is for the children . they are the beauty in life and , without them , we can not live .  but she says ,  i would never allow my daughter to do this . i would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this .  karima 's last happy memory is of her late husband , when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today 's iraq together . suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor , with her mom boasting about her potential in that career . life could n't have taken her further from that dream .  it 's not like we were born into this , nor was it ever in my blood ,  she says . what she does for her family to survive now eats away at her .  i lay on my pillow and my brain is spinning , and it all comes back to me as if i am watching a movie .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
