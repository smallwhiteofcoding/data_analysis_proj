{"text": "everyone goes through a rebellious phase . and , if you 're lucky , you 'll be able to look back on those years and laugh . if you 're less lucky , you spent those years on a reality show , so for the rest of time , millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead . in modern times , cats frolic among the ruins of ancient rome . but , hey , it could be worse . you could be responsible for the fall of western civilization , just like justa grata honoria , the roman princess whose wild ways and -lrb- literally -rrb- naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the roman empire . barely regal . smart , conniving , and ruthless , honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a roman emperor , except for that pesky y chromosome . as a young girl , she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother , valentinian iii , was crowned emperor of the western roman empire , while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage . hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life , honoria rebelled with aplomb , sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens . although her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal , they failed to satiate her need for attention and power , so honoria set her eyes on the throne . employing her ample charms , she seduced her brother 's royal chamberlain , eugenius , and together , they plotted to murder valentinian and seize power . but , alas , their scheme was soon exposed . eugenius was executed , and honoria was sent to a convent in constantinople . life as a nun was a fate worse than death for honoria , but even that could n't quell her ambition . she spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another . finally , out of sheer desperation , she turned to sources outside the empire . her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy valentinian and risk open war with rome . only one man fit that description : attila , king of the huns . attila the hubof course , honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the roman empire . but she was betting that after marrying her , attila would conquer the whole empire , and she 'd become queen to boot . attila had secretly been planning a move against rome for years , and honoria 's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike . wasting no time , he told valentinian that he planned to marry honoria , and demanded the dowry he 'd been promised . naturally , valentinian refused , and attila used his status as a  wronged husband  to invade roman territory in 451 c.e. . the hun armies quickly swept through the empire , destroying everything in their path , and eventually they arrived in rome . like all the other cities before it , rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the huns during the invasion . rome survived attila 's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe , the visigoths , but the western empire never recovered . within a generation , the armies of the goths , franks , and huns had overrun the area . the princess bride . ultimately , honoria became neither roman empress nor a hun queen . attila never rescued her , and she was eventually sent back to rome and left to her brother 's justice . not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed , and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again , valentinian settled on a suitable third option . after years of struggle , honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along : she was married off to an elderly roman senator , and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
