{"text": "bangladesh police have detained or arrested more than 18,000 people in the last 11 days in a crackdown on crime they say is aimed at improving security ahead of december elections . people arrested by bangladesh police in their latest round-up arrive at a jail in dhaka . human rights groups decry the actions as politically motivated . the round-ups began may 28 , days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections . police told cnn that by saturday 16,916 arrests had been made , while local media reported another 1,548 were arrested sunday . the awami league and the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody .  the timing and targets of the arrests are a dead giveaway they are politically motivated ,  brad adams of the new york-based human rights watch said in a statement .  it 's obvious that they are paying the price for the political parties ' refusal to accept the government 's conditions to participate in the elections .  the government rejects the allegations . the detentions , it said , are part of a planned sweep to rid the country of criminals .  our igp -lsb- inspector general of police , or chief of police -rsb- categorically said this special drive was being conducted to create a congenial atmosphere before the general election ,  said kamrul ahsan , a spokesman for bangladesh police .  it is not politically motivated ,  he said .  the intention is not to harass anybody politically .  the crackdown began after the awami league and the bnp said they would not cooperate with the government to develop a roadmap toward democracy unless it first releases the parties ' leaders . the two women who head the parties -- sheikh hasina of the awami league and khaleda zia of the bnp -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges . hasina is charged with bribe-taking . zia is being held on charges of graft for improperly awarding a multi-million dollar government contract . the current political crisis in the muslim-majority south asian country of 150 million can be traced , in large part , to the lingering animosity between the two women , political observers say . their rivalry runs so deep that the women are known in the country as the  battling begums .  begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country . since the country 's independence in 1972 , the awami league or the bnp has ruled bangladesh for all but eight years . both women have served as prime minister at one point or another . after its last stint in power ended in 2006 , the bnp handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections , as mandated by the country 's constitution . but the awami league refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government . hasina accused zia of stocking it with bnp backers . supporters and party members took to the streets in months of deadly clashes . to stem the tide of violence , a military-backed government took control in january 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency . it also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country 's graft-ridden politics . the caretaker government adopted the emergency powers rules . the rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime , human rights watch said . a wave of detentions followed . by some estimates more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes . among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians , including hasina and zia -- leading to the current political stalemate . the government wants to hold elections in the third week of december , and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting . the political parties allege the arrests are intended to pave the way for the election of pro-government candidates . they want their leaders set free before they sit down and talk with the government about a roadmap toward a successful election . they also threatened to organize mass movements to secure their leaders ' release .  it 's kind of an impasse ,  said taleya rehman , founder and executive director of the bangladesh-based non-profit democracy watch .  the government is conducting political dialogue with small parties . but they are of no significance . they need the two major parties .  on monday , the government announced it was releasing hasina from custody on medical grounds so she can go abroad for treatment . a similar release for zia was also expected . party members say the government 's move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country . hasina has a damaged ear resulting from a bombing attack that targeted her four years ago . zia is believed to have arthritis . meanwhile , the detentions continue -- almost 1,800 a day . in addition to political party members , the crackdown has also swept up several journalists .  that actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people 's minds ,  said sultana kamal , executive director of the legal aid group , ain o salish kendro -lrb- law and adjudication center -rrb- .  if you just arrest any tom , dick and harry saying this person may have arms , then people will legitimately raise questions about the mode of the whole operation .
