{"text": "longyearbyen , norway a vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment tuesday . the inside of one of the vaults at the svalbard global seed vault , on a remote island near the arctic ocean . dubbed the  doomsday vault ,  the seed bank on a remote island near the arctic ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world 's seed collections , protecting them from a wide range of threats including war , natural disasters , lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management . norwegian musicians performed tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault , located 130 meters -lrb- 427 feet -rrb- inside a frozen mountain . wangari maathai , a kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 nobel peace prize , placed the first seeds inside the vault , followed by other dignitaries . the inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds , with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world . in all , the shipment of seeds secured in the vault tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons , filling 676 boxes . the shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total , ranging from major african and asian food staples like maize , rice , and wheat to european and south american varieties of eggplant , lettuce , barley , and potato , according to the global crop diversity trust , which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds . watch as  doomsday  seed vault opens  eventually the svalbard global seed vault , as it is officially known , will hold as many as 4.5 million distinct samples of seeds -- or some 2 billion seeds in total -- encompassing almost every variety of most important food crops in the world , the global crop diversity trust said . the norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near longyearbyen , in the remote svalbard islands between norway and the north pole . building began last year . the united nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long-term conservation of crop diversity , and countries and foundations provide the funding .  the seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries ,  said cary fowler , executive director of the trust .  at these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years .  the vault 's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside .  we believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility ,  said magnus bredeli tveiten , project manager for the norwegian government . the vault sits at the end of a 120-meter -lrb- 131-yard -rrb- tunnel blasted inside the mountain . workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees celsius -lrb- just below 0 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area 's natural permafrost and the mountain 's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 c -lrb- 25 f -rrb- . the vault at svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in sussex , england , about an hour outside london . the british vault , called the millennium seed bank , is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants , as opposed to the seeds of crops . paul smith , the leader of the millennium seed bank project , said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops .  we must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us ,  smith told cnn . the idea for the arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the international treaty on plant genetic resources came into force in 2004 , the norwegian government said . the treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity . svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world . the norwegian government says it has paid 50 million norwegian kroner -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- to build the seed vault . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's becky anderson contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
