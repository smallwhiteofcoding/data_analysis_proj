{"text": "washington president bush on friday proposed a temporary , broad-based tax relief package aimed at spurring the nation 's slowing economy .  we can provide a shot in the arm  to the economy , president bush said friday at the white house . during remarks at the white house , bush , flanked by economic advisers , said the nation 's economy is at risk for a downturn and congress must act to head off trouble .  this growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours ,  bush said .  by passing a growth package quickly , we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy , and it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments , such as the housing market , from adversely affecting other parts of our economy .  watch more of bush 's tax outline  it should equal about 1 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product , or roughly $ 140 billion , he added . bush said the economy will continue to grow but at a slower rate . the president offered no specific details of the proposed package , but he did insist that it include tax incentives for business ,  including small businesses , to make major investments in their enterprises this year .  bush also said the economic package must include  rapid income tax relief  for consumers to  lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less .  although democratic leaders in congress expressed general support for bush 's remarks , other democrats on capitol hill met the president 's proposal with suspicion . two democratic leadership aides made it clear friday that the growth package would not win support from democratic leaders unless it includes relief for low and middle income earners .  we want to include people who pay taxes , not necessarily income taxes -- a lot of lower income people pay payroll taxes ,  said one aide . another source stated flatly ,  we 're not going to pass a bill in the house that does n't include low-income people .  sen. charles schumer , d-new york , said he was disappointed that bush did not include stimulus-spending measures aimed at helping the disadvantaged such as extending unemployment benefits . schumer said such spending initiatives would jump-start the economy faster than tax cuts alone .  i think if we avoid any of the ideological fights , we could actually pass something so that it would take effect on march 1 ,  schumer said . house speaker nancy pelosi , d-california , expressed agreement with bush on  the need to provide assistance immediately ,  saying in a statement that  we must invest our resources in such a way that injects confidence and consumer demand , promotes economic growth and creates jobs .  senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said ,  i also agree that our focus must be on finding temporary measures that will do the job effectively .  sen. edward kennedy , d-massachusetts , agreed that  we must act swiftly to boost the economy  but stressed the need to help families who  are struggling every day to pay their bills , heat their homes and pay their mortgages .  bush 's remarks came a day after talks on the subject with democratic and republican lawmakers , and following federal reserve chairman ben bernanke 's call for a fiscal stimulus package to help an economy beset by plummeting stock prices and a credit and mortgage crunch . bush said friday he was encouraged by his discussions with lawmakers .  i believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support .  existing income tax cuts supported by the bush administration are due to expire in 2010 , and the president called on congress to make them permanent .  unless congress acts , the american people will face massive tax increases in less than three years ,  bush said .  this tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk .  watch experts explain how to goose the economy  the proposed stimulus package comes as a leading gauge of future economic activity was released friday by the conference board . the december report showed a decline for a third straight month for the u.s. leading index -- down two-tenths of a percent . the report cited housing permits for the largest negative contribution to the index . see chart showing americans ' recession fears  on thursday , the dow jones industrial average of stock prices dropped more than 300 points after reports of slowing growth and massive debt write-offs by merrill lynch . the brokerage giant reported a nearly $ 10 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 and wrote off more than $ 11 billion in bad mortgage debts . former treasury secretary lawrence summers stressed the importance of whom any relief package would target .  it needs to go to people who are going to spend it ,  summers said friday on cnn 's  american morning .   that means particularly those who rely on tax refunds -- those receiving benefits , those whose incomes have been hurt by the downturn .  bernanke told the house budget committee on thursday that he does not believe the economy will enter a recession , but he said he expects growth to proceed at a slow pace this year and possibly into early 2009 . he said congress needs to take decisive action to boost the economy .  to be useful , a fiscal stimulus package should be implemented quickly and structured so that its effects on aggregate spending are felt as much as possible within the next 12 months or so ,  bernanke said . but he said any package should be  explicitly temporary  to avoid running up the government 's long-term debt . bernanke stopped short of suggesting that the bush tax cuts should be made permanent , telling lawmakers he supports  the law of arithmetic .   what comes in at least has to equal what goes out at some point ,  he said . in 2001 , americans received checks from the government designed to stimulate the economy . individuals received $ 300 and families $ 600 . twenty to 40 percent of the checks were spent within days . consumers saved one-third of the money , and two-thirds went back into the economy within two quarters , officials said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's deirdre walsh contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
