{"text": "london , england leaving school at 16 is not normally the route to success . but richard branson did just that , setting up a magazine and then entering the record business . now his brand is behind more than 300 companies -- from cola to trains , from phones to planes making virgin a global name . soon virgin will reach galactic proportions . in 2009 richard branson hopes to take tourists into space . cnn 's todd benjamin caught up with the billionaire in london and asked what drives him to create such a diverse enterprise . branson : what drives me to create a lot of different businesses is simply a feeling that we can , most likely , do it better than other people in particular areas . we wo n't create a business if somebody else is doing it really well , the only time we 'll create one is if it 's not being done well . benjamin : how would you describe your own personality ? branson : i love people , i love to learn . i never went to university so i see my life as one long university education i never had . i 'm very inquisitive , hence the fact we 've gone to 350 different businesses , which is quite unusual for a western company . benjamin : you run your companies as a series of independent companies . what do you look for in your key lieutenants ? branson : number one , the virgin brand is absolutely paramount , they must do nothing to damage the reputation of the brand . and the second thing is to look after their team of people . benjamin : your headmaster when you left high school said to you  branson , congratulations , i predict you 'll either go to prison or become a millionaire .  what was it in your character that you think made him make that observation ? branson : well i suspect the fact that at age 13 i 'm writing him letters on how he could organize the catering better and how the school could save money , and if they save money they could then put it into better facilities for the students . and i managed to persuade him to give me a study to start my magazine and it was only when he actually finally came to me and said  look , you 're either going to have to do your school work or your magazine ,  that i said  well , goodbye . i 'm off to do the magazine , but thanks very much .  benjamin : in your autobiography you write about being four-years-old and your mother stops the car and makes you get out and what does she make you do ? branson : we were on the way to my grandmother 's house in devon , and i think about three miles before we got there she made me get out and told me to find my own way to my grandmother 's house . basically , her approach was to try and get us to stand on our own two feet and she went to extreme measures sometimes to do so . benjamin : without your persona do you think the virgin brand could have ever become what it became ? branson : i think the particular virgin brand perhaps needed me , in the past , to get out there and be adventurous , and therefore to give the brand an adventurous feeling ; take on the big guys , which we did , and beat the big guys and that 's what 's created the virgin brand . i think now if my balloon pops , or the space ship just continues to go into space , or whatever , i think the brand is strong enough to withstand all that and it 'll continue to grow . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
