{"text": "a florida judge friday handed a legal victory to a former astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival , ruling evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial . lisa nowak , accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival , is set to go on trial in april . ninth judicial circuit judge marc lubet ruled that all were unlawfully obtained . he said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors , most concerning police tactics in their interview of lisa nowak and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car .  in each and every case , this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored ,  lubet wrote in his opinion .  unfortunately , in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands .  nowak , 44 , is accused of stalking air force capt. colleen shipman and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at orlando international airport in florida on february 5 . she pleaded not guilty march 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm , battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon . her trial is set for april . if convicted , she would face a sentence of up to life in prison . her defense attorneys had claimed nowak 's comments to police and her consent to search her car were made under duress . during a hearing held in august , lubet heard testimony from , among others , nowak , shipman and orlando police detective william becton , who interviewed nowak after her arrest . lubet said in his ruling that when nowak asked becton if she needed an attorney during the interview , he failed to answer her question in a  simple and straightforward manner .   there was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as ` formalities '  during the interview , lubet wrote . on the audiotape of the interview , there was no audible response from nowak on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court , and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police , lubet wrote .  thus , there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them .  nowak testified at the august hearing she did not respond to becton 's questions because she was confused , lubet wrote . in addition , he said , becton used  legally impermissible  statements and techniques , including threats , to get nowak 's statements and consent .  well , what you say can change what you 're charged with ,  becton said at one point .  right now we 're looking at -lsb- a -rsb- possible life felony of carjacking .  in a written statement , an orlando police department spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court , and referred questions to prosecutors . lubet noted that , although nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat , she was  subjected to a barrage of questions  beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call .  defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours ,  the judge said . nowak 's consent to search her car , lubet wrote ,  followed illegal police activity , such as a prolonged detention , threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent .  prosecutors accuse nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from houston to orlando -- wearing nasa diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot . her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers . shipman told police that after she got into her car , nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window . when shipman cracked it to talk to her , nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray , shipman said . police said nowak was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin . nowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to shipman , who had begun dating nowak 's former love interest , navy cmdr. bill oefelein , who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps . at the august hearing , becton testified that when he searched nowak 's car , he found maps showing how to reach the airport , maps of the airport 's layout , a buck knife and papers including a letter nowak appeared to have written to oefelein 's mother . he also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car . police previously said they also found a bb gun , a steel mallet , a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle . nowak 's attorneys in august filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense , saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders . on august 30 , lubet granted nowak 's attorneys ' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's cristy lenz contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
