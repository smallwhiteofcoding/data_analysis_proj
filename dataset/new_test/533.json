{"text": "democratic presidential candidate barack obama defended himself and his wife sunday against suggestions that they are insufficiently patriotic . sen. barack obama defended himself and his wife against recent suggestions that they are not patriotic . after a town hall meeting in lorain , ohio , a reporter asked obama about  an attempt by conservatives and republicans to paint you as unpatriotic .  the reporter cited the fact that obama once failed to put his hand over his heart while singing the national anthem . obama replied that his choice not to put his hand on his heart is a behavior that  would disqualify about three-quarters of the people who have ever gone to a football game or baseball game .  the reporter also noted that the illinois senator does not wear an american flag lapel pin , has met with former members of the radical anti-vietnam war group , weather underground , and his wife was quoted recently as saying she never felt really proud of the united states until recently . asked how he would fight the image of being unpatriotic , obama said ,  there 's always some nonsense going on in general elections . right ? if it was n't this , it would be something else . if you recall , first it was my name . right ? that was a problem . and then there was the muslim e-mail thing and that has n't worked out so well , and now it 's the patriotism thing .  the way i will respond to it is with the truth : that i owe everything i am to this country ,  he said . the first-term senator from illinois has been the subject of various debunked rumors since launching his presidential campaign -- allegations that he is a muslim , that he took his oath of office on a copy of the quran and that he attended a radical islamic school while living in indonesia as a boy .  you will recall that the reason i came to national attention was a speech in which i spoke of my love of this country ,  said obama . he and his wife , michelle , had already explained her comments .  she simply misspoke ,  he said .  what she was referring to was -lsb- that -rsb- this was the first time she has been proud of politics in america . watch what michelle obama said   that 's true of a lot of people who have been cynical and disenchanted . and she 's spoken about how she has been cynical about american politics for a very long time , but she 's proud of how people are participating and getting involved in ways that they have n't in a very long time .  about not wearing an american flag lapel pin , obama said republicans have no lock on patriotism .  a party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed , or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning , or are not fulfilling the veterans ' benefits that these troops need when they come home , or are undermining our constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary ?  that is a debate i am very happy to have . we 'll see what the american people think is the true definition of patriotism .  obama did not respond to the question about the weather underground , a group whose members bombed the u.s. capitol and the pentagon during the 1970s . last week , the new york sun reported that as an illinois state senator in 2001 , obama accepted a $ 200 contribution from william ayers , a founder of the group who was not convicted for the bombings and now works as a professor at the university of illinois at chicago . but the paper said that , in a statement , a spokesman for the obama campaign , william burton , said ,  sen. obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the weathermen group , as he does all acts of violence ... but he was an 8-year-old child when ayers and the weathermen were active , and any attempt to connect obama with events of almost 40 years ago is ridiculous .  former first lady sen. hillary clinton has said repeatedly that she is a stronger candidate because she has already shown she can withstand conservative attacks . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
