{"text": "san diego , california in a recent commentary , i wrote that , as a mexican-american , the ugliness of the immigration debate offends me -- not as a mexican , but as an american . ruben navarrette jr. lists 10 things u.s.-born hispanics find distasteful about the immigration debate . a woman wrote in and asked me to be more specific : just what was it about the immigration debate that was so ugly ? she came to the right place . after nearly 20 years of writing opinions and insisting that i do n't speak for all hispanics , in recent months , i 've heard from hundreds of hispanics who -- appreciative of my middle-ground approach to the immigration issue -- insist that i can speak for them anytime . so , with the authority vested in me , i 'll now share some of what other hispanics are saying . it 's not far off from what janet murguia had to say . as president of the national council of la raza , the largest hispanic civil rights organization in the united states , murguia recently delivered an important speech to the national press club . the topic : the immigration debate and what she called a wave of hate sweeping the land -- one that is n't limited to illegal immigrants , but which is now affecting all hispanics regardless of where they were born , what language they speak or what flag they salute . the way murguia sees it , immigration is  on the verge of becoming one of the largest civil rights issues of our generation .  and , hispanics are playing the piñata . murguia was right on the button . to borrow a phrase , it 's getting ugly out there . and u.s.-born hispanics see it as plain as day . here are 10 things they find distasteful about this debate : . • the hypocrisy . we have two signs on the u.s.-mexican border :  keep out  and  help wanted .  • the racism . with lightning speed , the debate went from anti-illegal immigrant to anti-immigrant to anti-mexican . • the opportunism . too many politicians are trying too hard to portray themselves as tough on illegal immigration . • the simple solutions .  build a wall .   deport all illegals .  a quick rule of thumb : if it fits on a bumper sticker , it 's not a workable policy . • the naiveté . people ask why mexico wo n't help stop illegal immigration . hint : last year , mexicans in the united states sent home $ 25 billion . • the profiling . dark skin and spanish surnames should n't be proxies for undocumented status . been to arizona lately ? • the meanness . nazi-produced internet video games let players shoot illegal immigrants crossing the border . fun stuff . • the amnesia . americans think grandpa was welcomed with open arms and that he plunged into the melting pot . whatever . • the buck-passing . americans love to blame mexico for their choices , yelling across the border :  stop us before we hire again .  • the double standard . the same folks who have zero tolerance for illegal immigrants easily tolerate those who hire them . some of this is painfully familiar , recalling earlier versions of this debate as it played out a hundred or two hundred years ago . hispanics are the new germans , the new irish , the new italians . but it 's also ugly . it was then . it is now . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
