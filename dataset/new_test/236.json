{"text": "new york chiquita brands international faces a $ 7.86 billion lawsuit filed wednesday on behalf of nearly 400 colombian families who say the company should be held responsible for the  torture and murder  of their loved ones . with a map of alleged victims , jonathan reiter makes his case wednesday at a new york news conference . attorney jonathan reiter said his clients are seeking  damages for terrorism , war crimes ... and wrongful death .  the plaintiffs are asking for $ 10 million in compensatory damages and $ 10 million in punitive damages for each of the 393 victims named in the suit . earlier this year , chiquita , as part of a plea agreement , admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to autodefensas unidas de colombia , or auc . auc was named a terrorist organization by the united states in 2002 , making it a crime to give them money . the lawsuit alleges chiquita 's interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments -- it accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group .  they conspired with the auc , aided and abetted them in a far-reaching conspiracy and plan to control every aspect of banana growing , distribution and sale ,  reiter said . the attorney said one couple refused to sell their banana farm  for pennies  and were killed by auc in 2001 , and other murder victims had been directed to  sell their bananas only to chiquita .  the families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals in their home country , he said .  the principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists , when you put guns into the hands of terrorists , then you are legally responsible for the atrocities , the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit ,  reiter said . responding to the allegations wednesday afternoon , the company said ,  chiquita brands international categorically denies the allegations made by these attorneys . we reiterate that chiquita and its employees were victims and that the actions taken by the company were always motivated to protect the lives of our employees and their families .  chiquita 's director of communications , michael mitchell , went on to say ,  our company had been forced to make protection payments to safeguard our workforce . it is absolutely untrue for anyone to suggest that these payments were made for any other purpose .  mitchell said the company will fight the allegations .  chiquita has already been the victim of extortion in colombia . we will not allow ourselves to become extortion victims in the united states .  in the march plea agreement , chiquita brands international agreed to pay a $ 25 million fine for the payments made by the company 's former banana-producing subsidiary in colombia . during a government investigation , the company admitted to making payments to auc even after outside counsel told the company those payments were illegal and should stop immediately . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
