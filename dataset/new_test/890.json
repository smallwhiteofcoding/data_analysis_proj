{"text": "when the roman emperor hadrian came to power in 117ad he inherited an empire that was overstretched militarily and creaking at the seams . a massive bust of hadrian 's head unearthed only last year is part of the exhibition at the british museum . one of his first acts was to pull the troops out of mesopotamia , modern-day iraq , a fact that is sure to resonate with visitors to the british museum  s superb exhibition  hadrian : empire and conflict  which opens on 24 july under the imposing classical dome of the reading room . curator torsten opper says :  no matter what our take is on the conflict in iraq today , we can relate to hadrian 's decision . maybe 10 or 15 years ago , it would n't have mattered so much . now it does .  hadrian was born in rome to a noble family whose origins lay in spain . one of the greatest of rome 's emperors , he consolidated imperial power , was a patron of architecture and travelled extensively across his lands . though married , he also took a homosexual lover , antinous , whose drowning in the river nile on the very day egyptians were celebrating the death in a similar manner of the god osiris remains one of ancient history 's great unsolved mysteries . the range of exhibits and their rarity means that this exhibition is going to be extremely well-attended . visitors will , for example , be the first members of the public anywhere to see a huge head of the emperor that was dug up recently at sagalassos in central turkey and would have once crowned a statue that was over five metres high .  a year ago , this was still lying buried in the ground ,  says opper .  it  s proof that roman history is n't done and dusted ; that we are still able to rethink the past and evaluate it .  the exhibition brings together 180 objects , from 31 sources in 11 different countries .  it has n't been an easy thing to do ,  adds opper .  many of these objects leave huge gaps in their home collection and many are extremely delicate . this is n't an exhibition that can travel . people will only be able to view it for these three months .  many of the most delicate objects are also those that give the most dramatic insight into hadrian 's reign . between 132ad and 135/6ad the jews of judea rebelled against roman rule . some of the insurgents took refuge in a cave in the desert , called the cave of letters , in which they were trapped by roman troops . few made it out alive . the climatic conditions of the cave have preserved objects in astonishing condition . there is a letter written by jewish leader simon bar kokhba -lrb- enquiring about a delivery of supplies -rrb- , as well as mirrors , a jewellery box and an astonishingly delicate glass plate , probably made in alexandria , that somehow survived flight into the desert and the perilous climb up a cliff to the cave . then there are three house keys , their wooden handles preserved , looking as if they would still open the locks for which they were made . opper says :  they  re immediately touching -- these were used by people to lock their homes thinking they  d be back in a week or two , but of course they were n't -- they all perished . and there are still many refugees now who still have keys to the homes they once lived in . it  s a potent symbol of conflict .  to the british hadrian will always be associated with the wall that was built across northern england , an 117km rampart with a fortification every 1.6 km . in schoolroom history this has traditionally been seen as a defence against the barbarian tribes to the north , but it was n't necessarily so .  the wall was a ruthlessly efficient symbol of oppression and in the end it broke the back of the local tribes ,  says opper . confirmation of this , perhaps , comes from two small writing tablets from the fortress of vindolanda , the oldest surviving hand-written documents in the british isles . in one an officer , presumably writing to a colleague who is taking over his post , derides the locals as the  little british ,  not worthy of worrying about very much - brief , battered and faded the letter may be , but as an example of high-handed imperialism it is hard to beat . click here to subscribe to cnn traveller . copyright Â© 2008 ink publishing and cable news network , lp , lllp , a time warner company . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
