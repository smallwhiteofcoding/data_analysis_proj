{"text": "one of the telephone numbers used to report claims of abuse at a polygamist sect 's texas ranch was previously associated with a colorado woman whom authorities have named a  person of interest ,  a court document says . rozita swinton , 33 , has been arrested in a case that is not directly related to the texas raid . the telephone calls in late march prompted authorities to raid the yearning for zion -lrb- yfz -rrb- ranch in eldorado , texas , where 437 children were removed . the ranch is owned by the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , a mormon offshoot that practices polygamy . rozita swinton , 33 , of colorado springs , colorado , was arrested this month on a charge of making a false report to police . the charge relates to an incident in february , but the texas rangers have said she is a person of interest in connection with the ranch calls . in the february incident , swinton is accused of calling authorities using the names  dana anderson  and  april ,  reporting abuse by male relatives , according to an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant . authorities have not clearly said that they think swinton made the march phone calls that prompted the raid . but the affidavit says she is  known to make false reports of sexual abuse to the police and other agencies .  watch how a hoax may be behind the ranch mystery  calls were made to a texas family shelter march 29 and 30 from a female identifying herself as sarah barlow , the affidavit says . the caller said she was 16 , had a baby about 8 months old and was pregnant again . she said that her 49-year-old husband was physically and sexually abusive toward her and that they were living at the yfz ranch . the phone calls were made from a prepaid cell phone with no available records , according to the affidavit . however , it has been used in other cases linked to swinton , the document says . although texas officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls , they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch . the flds has denied that any abuse takes place at the ranch . the woman identifying herself as sarah barlow also called a battered women 's shelter in snohomish county , washington , using another phone number , the affidavit says . that phone number was traced to swinton 's address , the affidavit says . on april 10 , the woman called the washington shelter again and was put on the line with a texas deputy . she said she felt that she would be punished for the trouble she had caused , was worried that her baby might be taken away and was angry with a woman she had contacted march 29 for prompting the raid by law enforcement . during that conversation , the affidavit says , the woman used terminology common to the flds , referring to her  sister wives ,  for instance . the phone number used in the washington call was traced to the colorado springs apartment where swinton lives , the affidavit says . the number was also used to call a utah organization for women escaping polygamy and an abuse counseling center in fort myers , florida , phone records showed . swinton pleaded guilty to a charge of false reporting in june 2007 and was under a 12-month deferred sentence , the affidavit says . at a custody hearing last week , a texas judge ruled that the state will temporarily retain custody of the 437 children removed in the raid . meanwhile , on tuesday evening , laboratory workers at san angelo coliseum completed taking dna samples from mothers and children , said janice rolfe , a spokeswoman for the state attorney general 's office . she did not say how many samples were taken . about 100 of the seized children from whom swab dna samples had already been taken were bused tuesday from the san angelo coliseum to group foster homes , the texas department of health and family services said . on wednesday , workers in eldorado continued to take voluntary dna samples from adults who live on the yfz ranch , rolfe said . rolfe said that at least 54 samples from adults have been taken there . the dna samples will be sent to laboratory corporation of america , based in burlington , north carolina . it could take longer than a month to get results . judge barbara walther , who last week ordered the dna testing of the children and ordered that they remain in state custody , signed an order this week authorizing the children 's move to foster care , officials said . at a meeting wednesday afternoon , walther and the state 's child protective services division agreed that 18 mothers with breast-feeding babies that are 1 year old or younger will be allowed to stay with their children in the homes where the children are placed . also , 23 mothers with 28 children ages 1 to 2 years will be allowed to stay in the same towns as their children . the remaining children , 2 to 18 years old , will be split up into available homes . the original order signed by walther called for every effort to keep siblings together , especially in the case of small children . rod parker , a spokesman for the flds families , blasted the action in a news conference from his salt lake city , utah , office .  the cps department of texas is afraid of due process ,  he said .  they would lose in a fair fight in this case , and that is why you 're seeing them move so quickly , and that is why you 're seeing them move unilaterally .  he said the court ignored motions asking that the children be placed with their relatives . the flds launched a web site this week to promote its side of the issue . the site , captivefldschildren.com , contains photos and videos taken inside the ranch during the raid . the site says donations are needed to help cover the  massive litigation costs associated with these lawsuits .  a link on the web site allows online donations . e-mail to a friend . cnn correspondent susan roesgen and journalist cheryl getty contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
