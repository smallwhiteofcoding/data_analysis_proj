{"text": "washington the dramatic drop in violence in iraq is due in large part to a secret program the u.s. military has used to kill terrorists , according to a new book by pulitzer prize-winning journalist bob woodward . bob woodward 's book ,  the war within : secret white house history 2006-2008 ,  came out monday . the program -- which woodward compares to the world war ii era manhattan project that developed the atomic bomb -- must remain secret for now or it would  get people killed ,  woodward said monday on cnn 's larry king live .  it is a wonderful example of american ingenuity solving a problem in war , as we often have ,  woodward said . in  the war within : secret white house history 2006-2008 ,  woodward disclosed the existence of secret operational capabilities developed by the military to locate , target and kill leaders of al qaeda in iraq and other insurgent leaders . national security adviser stephen hadley , in a written statement reacting to woodward 's book , acknowledged the new strategy . yet he disputed woodward 's conclusion that the  surge  of 30,000 u.s. troops into iraq was not the primary reason for the decline in violent attacks .  it was the surge that provided more resources and a security context to support newly developed techniques and operations ,  hadley wrote . woodward , associate editor of the washington post , wrote that along with the surge and the new covert tactics , two other factors helped reduce the violence . watch bob woodward explain the strategy  one was the decision of militant cleric muqtada al-sadr to order a cease-fire by his mehdi army . the other was the  anbar awakening  movement that saw sunni tribes aligning with u.s. troops to battle al qaeda in iraq . woodward told larry king that while there is a debate over how much credit the new secret operations should get for the drop in violence , he concluded it  accounts for a good portion .   i would somewhat compare it to the manhattan project in world war ii ,  he said  it 's a ski slope right down in a matter of months , cutting the violence in half . this is n't going to happen with the bunch of joint security stations or the surge .  the top secret operations , he said , will  some day in history ... be described to people 's amazement .  while he would not reveal the details , woodward said the terrorists who have been targeted were already aware of the capabilities .  the enemy has a heads up because they 've been getting wiped out and a lot of them have been killed ,  he said .  it 's not news to them .  if you were a member of al qaeda or the resistance or some extremist militia , you would be wise to get your rear end out of town ,  woodward said .  it is very dangerous .
