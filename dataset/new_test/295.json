{"text": "hispanics are described as the largest minority group in the united states , as a burgeoning force in the electorate and as an untapped frontier of the business market . yet these descriptions belie the complexity of the 44 million people to whom they refer . susana clar , with daughters vanessa -lrb- left -rrb- and virna -lrb- center -rrb- , says the labels  hispanic  and  latino  are limiting . even the terms used to name them -- hispanics , hispanic-americans , latinos , latino-americans , the spanish-surnamed -- too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions , some observers say .  we are mixed and we are many things ,  said phillip rodriguez , a documentary filmmaker . many of his films , such as  los angeles now  and  brown is the new green : george lopez and the american dream ,  explore the experience and identity of latinos in the united states . latinos  very often do n't share language , do n't share class circumstances , do n't share education ; it 's very difficult to speak about them as one thing ,  he said . from a census standpoint , being of hispanic or latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories : mexican , puerto rican , cuban or  other spanish , hispanic or latino  origin . in the latter more open-ended category , respondents can write in specific origins , such as salvadoran , argentinean or dominican . according to a pew hispanic center/kaiser family foundation survey in 2002 , that is how most latinos choose to identify themselves . when asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves , 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents ' country of origin . about one quarter choose  latino  or  hispanic ,  and 21 percent chose  american .  but the broader terms -- latino , hispanic -- are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a  trend among latinos ,  or when a politician appeals to the  hispanic vote .  the u.s. government came up with the term  hispanic  in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to spanish-speaking countries . the term  latino  refers to origins from latin america , which includes non-spanish speaking countries like brazil . the terms are often used interchangeably , which is a point of some contention in the wider community . but do the terms carry meaning among the people to whom they refer , or are they merely governmental designations ?  that 's the way you call our people ,  susana clar , 52 , said of the terms . she and her family emigrated from uruguay nearly two decades ago , and she works as a vice president in her daughter , vanessa di palma 's , salt lake city , utah-based communications firm .  either you are latino -lsb- or -rsb- hispanic . i 'm fine with that , but i think that we are so much more than that ,  clar said . manuel baez , 49 , a native of the dominican republic who owns an insurance agency in tampa , florida , laughingly answered the question of how he identifies himself .  manuel or manny ,  he said , adding ,  we 're being put together in this package and that 's too hard ,  he said , stressing that he did n't like labels . he continued ,  dominican-american really represents who i am , instead of dominican or latino .  he never uses hispanic to identify himself because  i am mixed ,  baez said .  hispanic does n't go with me because i do n't believe that spain was the best thing for latin america .   for me ... there is no such thing as a latino identity ,  said suzanne oboler , professor of puerto rican and latino studies at john jay college at the city university of new york .  there 's certainly a cultural understanding ... -lsb- and -rsb- a political identity ,  she said , noting that the many different groups will join on particular issues such as immigration and wages . but she stressed that it was not a homogenous group .  not all latinos speak spanish , for example . not all latinos are going to vote democratic ... all latinos are not immigrants .  others , such as carl j. kravetz , a longtime veteran of hispanic marketing , said similarities among the different subsets of latinos do show a latino identity , one partly fused through the group 's experience in the united states . kravetz heads a los angeles-based hispanic advertising agency called cruz/kravetz : ideas . the association of hispanic advertising agencies embarked on a latino cultural identity project last year -- when kravetz was the organization 's chairman -- to better understand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional spanish-language market . there is  very definitely a latino identity ,  kravetz said . it is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of country of origin , the group tends to  cluster  in a few areas , he said . those areas include interpersonal relationships -lrb- latinos tend to emphasize family ; individuality is not as important -rrb- , perceptions of time and space -lrb- they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy -rrb- , and spirituality -lrb- religion and spirituality have a strong influence on latino life and perception of the world -rrb- . david chitel , the founder of new generation latino consortium , a group of advertising and media companies , also said there are definite cultural ties among latinos , particularly between those born in the united states . so much so , he said , that he and others coined the term  new generation latinos  to refer to them .  we 're talking about people that have grown up here in the u.s. in latino households , most likely with their parents speaking spanish at home , eating certain foods at home , certain values and traditions that are instilled in them , from music to religious beliefs to the importance of family , these sorts of things ,  chitel said .  and it creates very much an identity that is latino .  chitel said this group of u.s.-born latinos should be reached with culturally nuanced media , in the same way the african-american market functions . still , some chafe at the labels .  every time it comes up it just kind of annoys me and makes me mad ,  anna rivas , of boulder , colorado , said of her background . her parents emigrated from mexico before she was born , but she said she 's never identified with the mexican culture .  on a regular basis i get asked where i 'm from ,  she said .  and i 'll usually reply , ` my parents are from mexico . ' and i do n't say , ` i 'm hispanic or latino , or i 'm from mexico , ' because i 'm not .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
