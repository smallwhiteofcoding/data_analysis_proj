{"text": "susan atkins , a terminally ill former charles manson follower convicted in the murder of actress sharon tate , on tuesday was denied a compassionate release from prison . susan atkins , califorina 's longest-serving female inmate , is shown in her most recent mug shot . atkins , 60 , has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated , her attorney said . in june , she requested the release , available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live . the california board of parole hearings ' decision -- posted tuesday on its web site -- came after a public hearing on atkins ' request . it means the request will not be forwarded to the los angeles superior court that sentenced atkins . the court would have had the final say on atkins ' release . her attorney , eric p. lampel , called the parole board 's decision  unfortunate .   -lsb- the board -rsb- ignored the vast majority of evidence presented ,  lampel said .  there was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses . it apparently fell on deaf ears .  known within the manson family as sadie mae glutz , atkins and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people , including tate , in august 1969 . according to historical accounts of the murder , atkins stabbed tate , who was eight months pregnant , and scrawled the word  pig  in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director roman polanski . by her own admission , atkins held tate down and rejected her pleas for mercy , stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times . atkins ' request roused long-dormant memories of the two-day killing spree that terrorized los angeles and left seven people dead . it polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who were n't -- over whether she should die behind bars . atkins told a 1993 parole board that tate pleaded for her unborn child 's life as she held her down .  she asked me to let her baby live ,  atkins said .  ... i told her i did n't have any mercy on her .  three of tate 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage out back . atkins was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher gary hinman . one of the first people atkins confessed to was virginia graham , who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the manson family was responsible for the murders . graham said last month she believed atkins should die in prison .  she showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy , none ,  graham said .  so why should anybody show her mercy at this time ?  sharon tate 's sister , debra , has staunchly opposed atkins ' release .  she will be set free when judged by god ,  debra tate has said .  it 's important that she die in incarceration .  los angeles county district attorney steve cooley said monday he was strongly opposed to the release , saying in a letter to the board it would be  an affront to people of this state , the california criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims .  cooley noted in his letter that atkins was initially sentenced to death , like others in the manson family , including its leader , charles manson . their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972 , when the u.s. supreme court struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time . california gov. arnold schwarzenegger said tuesday he was also opposed to releasing atkins .  i do n't believe in -lsb- compassionate release -rsb- ,  the governor told reporters .  i think that they have to stay in , they have to serve their time .  even if atkins is dying , schwarzenegger said ,  those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that i 'm not for the compassionate release .  earlier , suzan hubbard , director of adult prisons in california , also recommended against granting atkins ' request . vincent bugliosi , who prosecuted atkins and other members of the manson family , said he supported her release , if only to save the state money . through monday , the cost for atkins ' medical care since she was hospitalized march 18 totaled more than $ 1.15 million , and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $ 308,000 , said california department of corrections and rehabilitation spokeswoman terry thornton . terminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release , records show . in 2007 , 60 such requests were made to the department , thornton has said . ten were approved . atkins , who has been incarcerated since 1971 , is california 's longest-serving female inmate . according to a web site maintained by her husband and attorney , james whitehouse , she is now a born-again christian . during her incarceration , the site says , atkins worked to help at-risk youth , violent crime victims and homeless children , among others . the web site does not mention atkins ' illness . lampel said last month atkins is paralyzed on one side .  she can talk a little bit ,  lampel said .  she ca n't sit up in bed without assistance , and obviously she ca n't walk around because she 's an amputee .  atkins has expressed remorse for her crimes .  i know the pain i caused mrs. tate ,  she said at a parole board hearing in 1985 . ln may , authorities dug for buried bodies at the inyo county , california , ranch where manson and his followers once lived , after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there . nothing was found , authorities said . cnn 's ted rowlands contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
