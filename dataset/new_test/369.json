{"text": "danish authorities said tuesday they have arrested three people who allegedly were plotting a  terror-related assassination  of a cartoonist whose drawing of the prophet mohammed sparked rage in the muslim world two years ago . the cartoons of the prophet mohammed provoked widespread outrage in the muslim world two years ago . the danish security and intelligence service said police arrested a 40-year-old dane of moroccan origin and two tunisians . the danish citizen is charged with a terrorism offense , the intelligence service said , and the tunisians will be deported . police have not yet released the names of the three . the operation took place in the aarhus area of western denmark at 4:30 a.m. local time following lengthy surveillance , the intelligence service said . the target of the plot , the intelligence service said , was the cartoonist for the danish newspaper morgenavisen jullands-posten , which first published the controversial drawings in september 2005 . the paper identified the cartoonist as kurt westergaard . watch how threats have targeted cartoonists   not wanting to take any undue risks -lsb- the intelligence service -rsb- has decided to intervene at a very early stage in order to interrupt the planning and the actual assassination ,  the statement by jakob scharf , the agency 's director general , said .  thus , this morning 's operation must first and foremost be seen as a preventive measure where the aim has been to stop a crime from being committed .  the uproar over the cartoons ignited after the danish newspaper published caricatures of islam 's prophet mohammed . some muslims believe it is forbidden by the quran to show an image of the prophet . demonstrations erupted across the world in early 2006 after other newspapers reprinted the images months later as a matter of free speech . some turned deadly . many protesters directed their ire at denmark , prompting the closure of several danish embassies in predominantly muslim countries , including indonesia and pakistan . westergaard 's cartoon depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse . westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror . however , many in the muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist .  of course i fear for my life after the danish security and intelligence service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me ,  westergaard said in a statement posted on the newspaper 's web site .  however , i have turned fear into anger and indignation . it has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which i used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness .  cnn 's paula newton said the arrests reinforced growing fears in europe that radical islam was trying to suppress free speech .  more and more europeans feel that islam is a threat to their way of life ,  newton said . a recent gallup poll for the world economic forum showed a majority of europeans believed relations between the west and the muslim world were worsening . according to the poll this sentiment was strongest held among danish . westergaard remains under police protection and does not know whether it will continue .  i could not possibly know for how long i have to live under police protection ; i think , however , that the impact of the insane response to my cartoon will last for the rest of my life ,  he said .  it is sad indeed , but it has become a fact of my life .  carsten juste , the paper 's editor-in-chief , said staffers have been  deeply worried  for several months .  the arrests have hopefully thwarted the murder plans ,  he said on the newspaper 's web site . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's saeed ahmed contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
