{"text": "washington federal investigators will declare the 2001 anthrax case solved on wednesday , when they make public their case against government researcher bruce ivins , a government source familiar with the case told cnn on tuesday . ex-army scientist bruce ivins , seen here in 2003 , died from an apparent suicide last week . but the case will not be considered closed , because administrative details remain incomplete , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing . before making the information public , the fbi is expected to share the evidence of ivins ' involvement with survivors and relatives of victims in the anthrax attacks , the source said . a lawyer for maureen stevens , the widow of bob stevens , the first victim of the 2001 attacks , said she was invited to the session and will attend . the tabloid photo editor died after inhaling anthrax that investigators believe was in a letter sent to american media inc. , the publisher of the sun and national enquirer tabloids , at its offices in boca raton , florida . another source familiar with the investigation said tuesday that in the fall of 2001 , ivins borrowed a machine that can convert wet anthrax , the kind used at fort detrick , into dry powder , which was found in the anthrax letters . such machines , called lyophilizers , are not usually used at fort detrick , where ivins worked , though they are easy to obtain . experts said the report may have no significance .  i would n't necessarily make the conclusion that , just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer , that that provides a smoking gun , that he must be using this for sinister purposes ,  said peter hotez , chairman of microbiology at george washington university in washington . richard spertzel , a former biodefense scientist who worked with ivins at the lab at fort detrick , said there was  no way  a lyophilizer could have created the fine anthrax spores used in the 2001 letters . spertzel said a more advanced machine would have been needed , and that no one working at a u.s. government lab could have produced such high quality anthrax in secret . ivins , who is expected to be blamed for the mailings of the toxin , which killed five people and sickened more than a dozen others -- died july 27 at a hospital in frederick , maryland , from an apparent suicide attempt two days earlier . no charges have been made public . he became a suspect after investigators found dna evidence from the 2001 anthrax mailings on a flask used in his laboratory at the u.s. army medical institute of infectious diseases , said a source who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly about the case . ivins had worked for decades in the biodefense lab at fort detrick , where he was trying to develop a better vaccine against the toxin . the fbi had traced the anthrax used in the attacks to the lab by using a new technology , a u.s. official familiar with the investigation said . authorities were looking at whether ivins may have released anthrax to test a vaccine he was working on , another official said . some of the anthrax-laced letters , written in crude block letters , included the words ,  take penacilin -lrb- sic -rrb- now ,  according to photographs released by the fbi . since ivins ' death , suspicions about his involvement in the anthrax attacks have surfaced alongside questions about his sanity . at the time of his death , the 62-year-old scientist was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions . she accused him of having harassed , stalked and threatened her with violence . the woman told the court in her complaint that ivins had been treated at a mental health facility . steven hatfill , another government scientist who was named by the justice department as a  person of interest  in the attacks , was never charged . he sued the department , which settled the case in june . the skepticism in scientific circles about the strength of the case against ivins heightens the importance of the government 's unveiling of its evidence against the scientist , a former prosecutor said .  i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury ,  said andrew mcbride .  and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr. ivins , they ought to see that as well .  cnn producer kevin bohn contributed to this story .", "summary": "no summary"}
