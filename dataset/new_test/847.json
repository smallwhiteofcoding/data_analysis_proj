{"text": "former olympic champion angel matos of cuba faces a life ban after kicking a referee flush in the face during his taekwondo bronze medal match in beijing . matos reacted in extraordinary fashion to being disqualified by chelbat . matos , who took gold in sydney in 2000 , was winning 3-2 , with just over a minute left in the second round , when he fell to the mat after being hit by his opponent , kazakhstan 's arman chilmanov . matos lay down , awaiting medical attention , but was then disqualified by referee chakir chelbat of sweden for taking too much injury time . a furious matos reacted by pushing a judge , then pushed and kicked chelbat in the face . it left the swede with blood pouring from his lip while matos spat on the floor and was then escorted out of the arena .  we did n't expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur ,  said world taekwondo federation secretary general yang jin-suk .  i am at a loss for words ,  he told the associated press . matos ' coach , leudis gonzalez , is also in hot water for his angry reaction and claiming the kazakhs had tried to fix the match .  this is an insult to the olympic vision , an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and , in my opinion , an insult to mankind ,  yang added . although the arena announcer said matos and his coach were banned effective immediately , yang said due process must be followed before officially banning the two . it was not the only controversial moment in the four-day taekwondo competition , which was marred by several protests against judging decisions . earlier saturday , china 's double gold medalist chen zhong crashed out in the quarterfinals after initially being declared the winner . she was fighting britain 's sarah stevenson , who scored with a clear head kick -- worth two points -- in the final seconds of their bout . that would have put stevenson ahead and into the semifinals , but the judges ruled stevenson 's kick was n't solid enough for points , and chen was declared the winner 1-0 . after britain protested , the result was changed to put stevenson in the semifinal . she lost that to jeers from the partisan chinese crowd , but later won a bronze medal match . it was the first time a match result has been overturned since taekwondo became an official olympic sport . copyright 2008 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
