{"text": "turkey snatched a last-gasp winner to eliminate euro 2008 co-hosts switzerland and keep their own quarterfinal hopes alive with a 2-1 victory in rain-drenched basel on wednesday night . patrick mueller , left , and swiss goalkeeper diego benaglio battle for the ball with arda turan of turkey . arda turan scored with a deflected effort in the third minute of time added on to set up a group a finale against the czech republic on sunday to determine who takes the second quarterfinal place behind portugal . the turks came from behind after hakan yakin gave the swiss a 32nd-minute lead , with substitute striker semih senturk heading a 57th-minute equalizer through the hands of goalkeeper diego benaglio . the st jakob park stadium had been flooded by a deluge early in the match , with the downpour continuing until just before half-time . the treacherous conditions made defending a nightmare for both teams , and arda almost put turkey ahead in the 29th minute with a farcical effort . with minimal visibility in the heavy rain , benaglio punched a vicious free-kick by stand-in captain nihat kahveci onto the head of the 21-year-old winger -- but the ball bounced to safety off the outside of the post . however , it was the swiss who adapted the better and they took the lead through the veteran yakin . he was on hand to awkwardly steer home from close range with his weaker right foot after eren derdiyok -- who like yakin is of turkish origin -- beat the offside trap to collect a long pass from defender philippe senderos . derdiyok calmly check inside the defense in the penalty area and sent a low cross towards yakin -- who had to wait anxiously at the far post as the ball was held up in a huge puddle of water . yakin had earlier been denied by turkey goalkeeper volkan demirel , who also did well to tip a swerving free-kick by tranquillo barnetta around the post . yakin also missed an even easier chance than the goal he scored in the 34th minute when he stabbed the ball wide of the post following a superb right-wing cross by valon behrami which cut out the defense and goal custodian . turkey , sensing a lucky escape , came out after the break with renewed purpose and posed a greater threat as the pitch slowly drained of the excess water . semih justified his second-half introduction when he rose highest to meet nihat 's superb inswinging cross from the left flank , and benaglio could only palm the powerful header into the back of the net . tempers flared as both sides went in search of the victory , but there was no repeat of the violent scenes that followed switzerland 's world cup playoff victory against the turks in november 2005 . volkan made another superb save from yakin , and turkey held off the swiss onslaught before arda cut in from the right and fired a shot from just outside the penalty area which clipped the heels of patrick mueller and looped over the helpless benaglio .  i did wish for rain to stop . i did pray to god for that ,  turkey coach fatih terim told reporters .  we could n't predict mud in the middle of the summer .  it 's not easy to come back from a goal down at the european championship , considering we hit the woodwork once . but we fought a lot in the second half and we created many opportunities .  he added :  tonight we reminded everyone a little bit about turkey . against the czech republic , we will be unforgettable .  defeat was a bitter blow for switzerland , whose fellow co-hosts austria will also be eliminated on thursday if they lose to poland in vienna .  of course the disappointment is huge ,  switzerland coach koebi kuhn said .  but i ca n't blame it on any player or anyone else . we lost twice unluckily .
