{"text": "the u.s. government thursday announced its highest penalty for coal mine safety violations , $ 1.85 million , for a collapse that killed six miners in utah last year . supervisory mining engineer joe zelanko on thursday describes the earth movements at crandall canyon mine . insufficient pillar support and activity in areas that should not have been mined caused the august crandall canyon mine collapse , federal investigators found . the government fined the mine operator , genwal resources , $ 1.34 million  for violations that directly contributed to the deaths of six miners last year ,  plus nearly $ 300,000 for other violations . the government also levied a $ 220,000 fine against a mining consultant , agapito associates ,  for faulty analysis of the mine 's design .  the mine 's owner had insisted that earth movement detected at the time of the collapse had caused the disaster . but investigators found instead that the collapse caused the earth movement .  it was not -- and i repeat , it was not -- a natural occurring earthquake ,  said the government 's top mine safety official , richard e. stickler . stickler , the acting assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health , said ,  pillars failed under excessive load and ejected coal very violently .  stickler also said the mine 's operator  was taking more coal than allowed from the barrier pillars and the floor .   this dangerously weakened the strength of the roof support ,  stickler said . in addition to the six miners killed in the initial cave-in august 6 in northwest emery county , three would-be rescuers died 10 days later in a subsequent collapse . the bodies of the six miners killed in the initial collapse were never recovered . richard gates , the lead investigator for the government , said the pillars in the mine  simply were not large enough to support the load .  that resulted in a  catastrophic failure of pillars over a broad area ,  as large as half a mile , he said . university of utah scientists said in june that the collapse was not the result of an earthquake .  as seismologists , we 're as certain as we can be that the seismic event registered as a magnitude-3 .9 shock was due to the collapse of the mine and not a naturally occurring earthquake ,  said walter arabasz , director of the university 's utah seismograph stations , in a written statement . earlier this year , a labor department report criticized mine safety and health administration officials for approving plans for a risky mining technique , known as retreat mining , that was in use before the collapse . in the process , miners remove pillars of coal that support the roof of a chamber one by one , allowing the roof to collapse behind them . mine owner bob murray repeatedly denied in the days after the disaster that his company practiced retreat mining at crandall canyon . he later admitted that the practice had been used at the mine but said it was not being done at the time of the disaster .", "summary": "no summary"}
