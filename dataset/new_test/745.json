{"text": "the supreme court ruled wednesday morning that child rapists can not be given the death penalty , effectively reserving the punishment only for murderers . cnn 's jeffrey toobin said the court 's ruling falls in line with other decisions on the death penalty . the 5-4 decision stems from a louisiana case in which patrick kennedy , 43 , was sentenced to die in 2003 for the sexual assault of his 8-year-old stepdaughter . proponents of louisiana 's law , which allowed child rapists to be eligible for the death penalty , say that besides murder , no crime is more deserving of the death penalty than child rape . kennedy would have been the first rapist in 44 years to be executed for a crime in which the victim was not killed . in the majority opinion , justice anthony kennedy said  evolving standards of decency  forbid capital punishment for any crime other than murder . cnn 's senior legal analyst , jeffrey toobin , spoke with cnn 's heidi collins outside the supreme court about the impact of the ruling . collins : this is a huge decision here . what do you make of it ? toobin : it was just high drama in the court today . it 's always dramatic at the end of the supreme court term . here it was literally life and death , one of the big open questions in constitutional law about the death penalty : can you execute someone for a crime other than murder ? anthony kennedy , the swing vote on so many cases , decided this case , it was 5-4 . ... he did n't diminish the seriousness of the crime , but he said the risks of expanding the death penalty are simply too great . he pointed out that there are more than 5,000 child rapes every year in the united states . all of them would raise the possibility of the death penalty . there are only a handful of states -- i think it was six -- that allow the death penalty for child rape . forty-four states and the federal government say no . he said there is a national consensus that this is not an appropriate punishment . so , this really rules out not just the death penalty for child rape , but any crime other than murder . so it 's a major , major decision . see more about the reach of the decision  collins : a national consensus except those six states . it 's interesting when you look at the court of public opinion . how do you think this decision is going to go down in public ? toobin : well , i think it 's a tough call because support for the death penalty nationwide in the past 10 years has actually been going down . but child rape is such a horrendous crime and all of us have such a natural revulsion towards it that you 're never going to get a lot of support for any sort of reduction in sentence . but i think , given the fact that this is a supreme court that said no death penalty for murderers under 18 , no death penalty for the mentally retarded , this decision is consistent with a certain restriction on the death penalty , which is reflected in the court but also in a kind of national change that 's going on . collins : and in sean callebs ' piece that we had , i do n't know if you heard it . toobin : i saw it , yeah . collins : one woman , who actually brought up a very interesting point , when you think about all of this and when you think about the child , the victim , she said , you know , if they know they 're going to die for this crime , why would they leave a living witness ? toobin : justice kennedy made precisely that point in the opinion . he said , allowing the death penalty here would create a perverse incentive for child rapists to murder their victims . he also pointed out what a difficult moral choice it would put child victims in testifying , giving children literally the power of life and death in their testimony over their attackers . that is something that he wanted to relieve children of -- that burden . collins : will they always have to testify ? toobin : yeah , pretty much . there have been rare examples ... if a child , for example , is simply too young to testify . there are horrible cases of rapes of babies and things like that . but by and large there has to be some sort of testimony from a child . it can be in a noncourtroom setting . it can be sort of in a deposition , not in front of the jury . but you do have to have the child testify . collins : it 's just such a tough decision all around . 5-4 on that one , very interesting .", "summary": "no summary"}
