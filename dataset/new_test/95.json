{"text": "washington the white house is blasting congressional democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans ' care programs to the president 's desk by veterans day . the white house 's dana perino accused democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage .  there 's absolutely no reason that the veterans ' bill could not have been signed by the president today , except for the political games that the democrats decided to play with it ,  white house press secretary dana perino said sunday in crawford , texas . congressional democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $ 150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities , including health , labor and education . democrats also added $ 3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs . the labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $ 10 billion over last year 's funding for those programs . the president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending . the house passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached , but the senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president . perino accused the democrats of  trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes .   the president wants clean legislation , a clean bill to fund the veterans ,  perino said . on saturday , the democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to president bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending , sayings disagreements over funding levels  have never been so great that we can not reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the american people .   key to this dialogue , however , is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground ,  house speaker nancy pelosi , d-california , and senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said in the letter . the leadership said last year 's congress , which was still under republican control , had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs . congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through december 14 , the leadership said . the current funding level  is still below the $ 3.9 billion extra that we passed ,  said nadeam elshami , spokesman pelosi .  we are committed to getting the extra funding that the congress already voted on the president 's desk for his signature .  the leadership blamed republican members of congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill . perino , though , said the democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of congress .  the democrats decided not to send the president this bill ,  perino said .  that has to be laid at their feet .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's deirdre walsh contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
