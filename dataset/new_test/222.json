{"text": "london , england a six-month trial was launched this week that promises to transform the way luggage is tracked and monitored at london 's heathrow airport . as many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage . the trial -- run by baa and airline emirates -- is using rfid -lrb- radio-frequency identification -rrb- technology to tag baggage . this will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport . the crucial difference between rfid and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy . barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned . if not scanned , details must be entered manually into the system , adding time and error to the process . baa estimates that heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through . rfid is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy . the # 150,000 trial -- the first of its kind in the uk -- will continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with emirates to and from dubai , and transferring through heathrow . a duplicate of the heathrow system has been installed at dubai airport . during the check-in process at heathrow terminal 3 , staff apply tags containing rfid chips to bags with information including the passenger 's name and route . the chips are then read on entry into the baggage system ; they are tracked as they move throughout ; and finally on leaving the system . as a result , says shaun cowlam , logistics director at heathrow airport , staff can know where a bag is at  every moment of every day  . baa is also considering introducing a sms text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are . when passengers arrive at heathrow , says cowlam , the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at . ultimately , the use of rfid could extend services to frequent flyers , and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in , and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery . the main benefits , however , will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as heathrow and dubai , as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights . emirates and baa are sharing the costs of the trial . but as vic sheppard , emirates vice president for uk and ireland says ,  cost is not an issue  , especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags . and as cowlam adds :  if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly .  hong kong international airport was one of the first to deploy rfid technology in 2005 . but as outlined in a recent survey by sita , rfid is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed .  for this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology ,  says cowlam . that widespread adoption may not be far off . the sita survey indicated that rfid tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009 . it 's still early days , but baa and emirates are optimistic for rfid 's future in airports .  there have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years . but in the last few decades there has n't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling ,  says sheppard .  this is a major step forward .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
