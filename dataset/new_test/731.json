{"text": "flint , michigan sen. barack obama monday proposed spending billions to revitalize the nation 's economy , a plan the campaign of his likely republican opponent said would slow economic growth with higher taxes . sen. barack obama wants to spend $ 60 billion on america 's infrastructure . during an economic speech in flint , michigan , obama promised to spend billions to improve america 's education , infrastructure , energy and health care systems . to improve america 's competitiveness , the senator from illinois said he wants to spend $ 10 billion on childhood education , $ 150 billion over 10 years on developing alternative energy and $ 60 billion over 10 years to build  21st century infrastructure .  obama said he would pay for these programs by ending the war in iraq , reducing government waste , charging polluters for greenhouse gas emissions and ending the bush tax cuts for wealthy individuals . during his speech in michigan , a state hard hit by the decline of the american automobile industry , obama also rejected protectionist trade polices that many unions say would help protect american jobs , saying  it is impossible to turn back the tide of globalization .  watch obama call for america to compete in the global economy  obama said he disagreed with those who want to  build a fortress around america ; to stop trading with other countries , shut down immigration , and rely on old industries .   not only is it impossible to turn back the tide of globalization , but efforts to do so can make us worse off ,  obama said .  rather than fear the future , we must embrace it . i have no doubt that america can compete -- and succeed -- in the 21st century .  a mccain spokesman attacked obama 's plan , saying the democrat 's  agenda to raise taxes and isolate america from foreign markets will not get our economy back on track or create new jobs .   to help create jobs in america , we need to lower taxes and open up foreign markets to american goods ,  said mccain spokesman tucker bounds .  americans can not afford barack obama 's ` change ' that takes us back to the failed policies of the past .  but obama said now was the time to commit to long-term investments in america 's future and blasted mccain for wanting to continue president bush 's economic policies , saying  there is a clear choice in this election . instead of reaching for new horizons , george bush has put us in a hole , and john mccain 's policies will keep us there . i want to take us in a new and better direction .  i reject the belief that we should either shrink from the challenge of globalization or fall back on the same tired and failed approaches of the last eight years ,  he said .  it 's time for new policies that create the jobs and opportunities of the future -- a competitiveness agenda built upon education and energy , innovation and infrastructure , fair trade and reform .  the two campaigns have been sparring over who would be a better steward of america 's ailing economy , and both candidates have been reaching out to blue-collar voters , many of whom backed republican president ronald reagan over the democrats , in part , because of cultural issues .  i believe that there are stark differences between myself and sen. obama . ... and i believe that the same appeals that president reagan made to the so-called reagan democrats will succeed there ,  mccain said during a campaign stop in arlington , virginia . watch mccain vow to win reagan democrats  a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released thursday suggested voters favor obama over mccain to handle the economy 50 percent to 44 percent . the poll , conducted june 4-5 , had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .", "summary": "no summary"}
