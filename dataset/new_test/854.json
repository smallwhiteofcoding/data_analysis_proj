{"text": "mogadishu , somalia a roadside bombing in somalia 's capital killed 21 women who were cleaning rubbish from a southern mogadishu street on sunday morning , a hospital official said . mogadishu residents gather around victims of the bomb attack along the city 's maka al mukarama road . the bomb blast wounded another 46 people , most of them somali women who had gathered to clean maka al mukarama road in southern mogadishu 's kilometer 4 district , according to medina hospital director dr. dahir dhere .  it suddenly turned the area into a carnage , scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area ,  said witness asha ise gedi .  there were pools of blood everywhere . i have never seen such mass killing .   they were innocent poor mothers or sisters ,  gedi said .  why did they deserve this ?  it is unclear who is behind the attack . mogadishu mayor mohamed omar habeb mohamed dhere , who was recently fired by the country 's prime minister , blamed the islamic courts union for waging the attack . but the head of the islamist insurgent group , abid rahim ise adow , denied any involvement and blamed somalia 's government for orchestrating the attack . the victims were participating in a program that allows somali women to work as street cleaners in exchange for food . the united nations ' world food program organized the program , which began last year and is administered by mogadishu 's regional authority . mogadishu has been the site of violence in recent months between ethiopian troops and islamist fighters . somalia 's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital , with the help of the better-equipped ethiopian forces . on saturday , two-thirds of the somali government ministers announced their resignations , blaming prime minister nur hassan nur ade 's  dictatorship ,  which they said included his firing of mogadishu 's mayor . nur ade said he suspects the mass resignations were aimed at weakening implementation of the peace agreement between somalia 's transitional government and the opposition alliance for the re-liberation of somalia . he said he had no plans to resign . the peace agreement , signed june 9 in djibouti , calls for a cease-fire between somalia 's u.n.-backed transitional government and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia , an opposition group that includes members of the islamist court union which overthrew the government in 2006 . the icu was ousted from power later that year by ethiopian forces , with the support of somalia 's transitional government . if followed , the peace deal would pave the way for a withdrawal of ethiopian troops -- a major sticking point for islamist fighters who oppose their presence . the agreement calls on the alliance to dissociate itself from armed groups still fighting the government and for all sides to allow  unhindered humanitarian access and assistance  to all somalis . a joint committee led by u.n. officials will monitor the agreement 's implementation . ethiopian forces became embroiled in an islamist insurgency after the ethiopian forces invaded somalia in december 2006 to overthrow the icu leaders and reinstall the transitional government . as guerrilla attacks mounted , efforts to replace the ethiopians with an african union-led peacekeeping mission faltered . ethiopia 's invasion had the blessing of somalia 's government and the united states , which accused the icu of harboring fugitives from the al qaeda terrorist movement . the conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of somalis , further worsening a humanitarian crisis that dates back to the collapse of the country 's last government in 1991 . the situation has been exacerbated by drought , continual armed conflicts in central and southern somalia , and high inflation on food and fuel prices . cnn 's alan duke and journalists mohamed amin adow and abdi nasir mohamed contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
