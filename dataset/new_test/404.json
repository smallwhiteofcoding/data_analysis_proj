{"text": "cairo , egypt omar bin laden has a message for his father , osama :  find another way .  omar bin laden says he last saw his father in 2000 when the son decided to leave al qaeda . the son of the most-wanted man in the world spoke sunday to cnn in a quiet , middle-class suburb about an hour outside cairo , egypt . omar bin laden , who works as a contractor , said he is talking publicly because he wants an end to the violence his father has inspired -- violence that has killed innocent civilians in a spate of attacks around the world , including those of september 11 , 2001 .  i try and say to my father : ` try to find another way to help or find your goal . this bomb , this weapons , it 's not good to use it for anybody , '  he said in english learned in recent months from his british wife . he said that 's not just his own message , but one that a friend of his father 's and other muslims have expressed to him .  they too say ... my father should change -lsb- his -rsb- way ,  he said . watch whether omar bin laden thinks his father will ever be caught  he said he has n't spoken to his father since 2000 , when he walked away from an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan with his father 's blessings . he said he has no idea where his father is , but is confident he will never be caught because locals support him . asked if his father might be living along the afghan-pakistan border , he said ,  maybe , maybe not .   either way , the people there are different ,  he said .  they do n't care about the government .  now , he and his wife are preparing to launch a movement far different from the one his father , osama bin laden , launched . they are pursuing a movement for peace . at first glance , omar bin laden appears to have little in common with the man who has eluded international efforts to find him . the 26-year-old 's hair is bound in neat braids , he drives a jeep and is married to a british national twice his age . but the physical resemblance quickly sinks in , even without the long beard his father favors . it is a resemblance he does n't avoid .  being osama 's son , i do n't hide it . i do n't hide my name ,  he said .  i am proud by my name , but if you have a name like mine you will find people run away from you , are afraid of you .  he said he does n't consider his father to be a terrorist . when his father was fighting the soviets , washington considered him a hero , he said .  before they call it war ; now they call it terrorism ,  he said . he said his father believes his duty is to protect muslims from attack .  he believes this is his job -- to help the people ,  he said .  i do n't think my father is a terrorist because history tells you he 's not .  however , omar bin laden -- who was 14 when he began training in al qaeda camps -- said he differs greatly with his father over the killing of civilians . was 9/11 a just attack ?  i do n't think 9/11 was right personally , but it happened ,  he said .  i do n't think ... -lsb- the war -rsb- in vietnam was right . i do n't think what 's going on in palestine is right . i do n't think what 's going on in iraq is right .  if we make what is right and not right , we will make a very big list ,  he said . he said he left al qaeda because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians . he said his father did not try to dissuade him from leaving al qaeda .  i told him i was going , and wanted to try life and see what it was like outside because , from a young age i was with my father , and i only saw and heard my father and his friends . my father told me , ` if this is what your choice -- your decision -- is , what can i tell you ? i like you to be with me , but this is your decision . '  so father and son went their separate ways . but there has been no running from the bin laden name , not after the events of september 11 . on that day , omar bin laden was in saudi arabia , where 15 of the 19 hijackers were from . asked if , upon learning of the news , he knew his father had been behind it , he replied ,  yeah , maybe .  he said he felt sadness for those killed .  i do n't think 9/11 was right personally ,  he said .  i do n't agree with 9/11 or with any war where only civilians are dying .  asked why he did not protest more strongly his father 's role in the killing of civilians , he said it is up to the religious clerics close to his father to tell osama bin laden to change tactics in the name of islam . and even if that most unlikely scenario were to occur , he said , al qaeda would not stop .  my father does n't have the power to stop the movement at this moment .  sitting by his side throughout the hour-and-a-half interview was his wife , zaina . the two are organizing a multi-month horserace through north africa in the name of peace , set to kick off this year . but getting sponsors to line up behind the name bin laden has been difficult .  it would probably have been easier to do a race without having omar 's name , but then the race would just be a race , it would n't be a race for peace ,  his wife said . omar bin laden said his relationship with his father was limited . he is the fourth of 11 children born to his father 's first wife , and he is one of 19 children osama bin laden has fathered .  most of the time he busy , so busy , all the day he 's busy -lsb- with -rsb- his friends . he was working a lot .  omar bin laden is now undertaking perhaps an impossible task : trying to rebrand the name they share . but he said he is not looking for approval from his father .  my life , i take care of my life ,  he said .  my father he take care of his life .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
