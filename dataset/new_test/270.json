{"text": "kenya has enjoyed a reputation as one of east africa 's most stable nations since achieving independence from the uk in 1963 . residents of the mathare slum in nairobi shout at demonstrators during violent clashes . but a booming tourism industry , impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to the economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty , violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions . tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in kenya , with the country 's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes . last week 's election pitched incumbent president mwai kibaki , a member of kenya 's largest kikuyu tribe , against opposition leader raila odinga of the luo tribe . the kikuyu make up about 22 percent of kenya 's population . mostly originating from kenya 's central highlands , the kikuyu have long wielded strong economic and political power within the country . kenya 's first post-independence leader , jomo kenyatta , president from 1964 until 1978 , was a kikuyu . kibaki , a government minister from 1965 until winning power as head of the party of national unity in elections five years ago , also enjoys the support of kenyatta 's successor , daniel arap moi , a member of the kalenjin tribe who ruled kenya for 24 years from 1978 to 2002 . the luo make up around 13 percent of the population , mostly in the west of the country . but they also form a sizeable community in some of nairobi 's most notorious slums , such as the vast kibera shantytown where odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week 's fiercest violence has occurred . odinga 's orange democratic movement is also backed by many members of the luhya tribe , kenya 's second largest ethnic group , after odinga promised to make a leading luhya his deputy if elected . this week 's violence came as election officials declared victory for kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for odinga in the closest presidential vote in kenyan electoral history . but the result has been questioned by international election observers , throwing the country 's political future into doubt . kibaki 's first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for kenyan democracy . however , his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
