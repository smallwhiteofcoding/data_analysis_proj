reynolds wolf is here to help with the breakdown on some cool tech toys . -lrb- begin video clip -rrb- . reynolds wolf , cnn reporter : are you searching for that perfect gift , but you are just a little bit stumped ? well , no worries . brian cooley from cnet.com is here to help us out , steer us clear and hopefully give us some great ideas . and i know you have some great ideas for us . brian cooley , editor-at-large , cnet.com : look at these beauties . first of all , for gaming , you know the nintendo wii is hot , but you ca n't find one ? the nintendo ds light is a pretty good placeholder . the dual screen that it 's known for , they 've slimmed it down from its original ds . and of course that great legacy of all those great nintendo games . and pretty cheep . for $ 130 or less you can get one of these . that 's very affordable . check out this music player , reynolds . it 's gon na be the next kind of ipod . it 's from sandisk . it 's called the sansa connect . that little bump is a wifi antenna . this can connect wirelessly to the internet or to other devices like it to share music , download music and stream internet radio . that is really the future of ipod-like devices . if you want to give a phone , but you also want to give a music player , this one does both . nokia 's 5300 music express is a great music player . it 's not an ipod , but it 's not bad . transport controls and volume buttons out here tell you that it 's something different . and then for a camera , i like this very flat sony t100 . it 's pocket-size , which is very hot these days . nice slide-down door . 8 mega pixels , image stabilization and a great big screen for sharing photos . wolf : brian cooley of cnet.com , thank you so much . cooley : you bet . -lrb- end video clip -rrb- . shoutout . george ramsay , cnn student news : time for the shoutout ! when did the first ipod debut ? if you think you know it , shout it out . was it : a -rrb- 1997 , b -rrb- 1999 , c -rrb- 2001 or d -rrb- 2003 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! if you guessed c , you 've got the right tune . the popular portable players first made the scene in the fall of 2001 . that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! tech in the classroom . azuz : whether it 's an ipod , sony , samsung or zune , it seems like you ca n't go anywhere these days without seeing people plugged in to some type of mp3 player . and if you 're on a college campus , you might think students walking around with their ear buds in are listening to music . but do n't be fooled . they could just be studying up for class . -lrb- begin video clip -rrb- . azuz : walk around any college campus and those famous white earplugs seem to be everywhere . but sometimes the playlist is n't quite what you 'd expect . lectures on computer science instead of american idol . not so much sum 41 as history 101 . some teachers have used the audio ipod in their lessons , but at the georgia institute of technology , professor jim foley hopes to transfer his visual web lectures to the video ipod . professor foley , user interface design teacher : the students who did web lectures earned grades that were about 10 % better -- we did that three years ago . azuz : as mp3 players become essential parts of students ' lives , they have the potential to rival the laptop as learning tools in the classroom . with a graduate student 's help , foley records lectures before class , so that students can raise questions when they arrive . students from foley 's user interface design course say they find it valuable to review lectures when convenient . kathy pham , student in professor foley 's user interface design class : it takes 15 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other side of campus . and to be able just to download the mp3 to my ipod and just walk across campus , would be very beneficial . scott gilliland , student in professor foley 's user interface design class : a lot of people ca n't get to a full desktop computer whenever they need to listen to the lectures , and it 's nice to be able to take them with you . azuz : although students show enthusiasm towards mp3 players , there are limitations because they 're small . foley : the screen resolution is smaller and navigating between pages will be a little bit slower than on the computer because on the computer i just use the mouse . with the ipod i have to use the scrollwheel and scroll around . azuz : like the laptop , the mp3 player is a popular and revolutionary way to gather and disseminate information . regardless of what teachers decide to use , players and laptops will remain allies . besides , you need a laptop to operate an ipod and vice versa . -lrb- end video clip -rrb- . podcast promo . azuz : and if downloading lectures is n't enough , we 've got another cool thing you can do with an mp3 player : watch cnn student news ! that 's right , you can download our podcast at cnnstudentnews.com or at itunes . so you wo n't miss out on the news when you 're on the go . now and then . ramsay : with cell phones , thin is in . but you had to flex some muscle to handle its oversized ancestor . an ipod can hold your whole music library . but a vintage walkman let you jam out one cassette at a time . microchips keep getting smaller and smaller . but old school computers took up a lot more space . and game controllers have buttons for every possible move . but the retro version ? one button , one joystick , tons of fun . learning with technology . azuz : it 's not just slimmer cell phones and smaller computers . advances in technology are changing the world we live in all the time . and one of the places where those changes are taking place is schools . so we talked to some students and experts to hear what they have to say about teaching with tech . -lrb- begin video clip -rrb- . trina davis , president , international society for technology in education : we started off , when we were first starting to integrate technology , kind of at that basic level . matthew lewis , junior , greenside high school : we of course use laptops and computers . each teacher is assigned a laptop . and also , we have computer labs and a media center with computers inside . don knezek , ceo , international society for technology in education : certainly just dropping technology into a learning environment does n't necessarily improve it unless you are sure that the activities that you are doing align with the expectations that you have for learning . ammarah mahmoud , junior , salem high school : i think many careers today require for people to know how to use technology , so it 's important to learn that in school . knezek : so you ca n't convince me that a student without basic fundamental technology skills is on equal footing for employment . mahmoud : i do n't think schooling should be technology dependent , because i think that , at the same time , we should n't rely on something that does n't have a mind of its own . knezek : you can certainly abuse technology . you can abuse the printed word . you can abuse access to external resources . certainly if teachers and school leaders and parents use the same standards that they would use for any resource for technologies , then we 're in fine shape . lewis : i can see people in the future having something where you just scan , and all of your , you know , personal information comes up and everything about you can come up on a screen , and i think that 's really cool . davis : customization , very innovative , lots of gaming , lots of 3-dimensional spaces and just social spaces that feed on the needs of young learners . -lrb- end video clip -rrb- . goodbye . azuz : and that is the last word in this special edition of cnn student news . we 'll see you back here soon for our next summer show . and of course we thank you for watching everyone . i 'm carl azuz . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
