there is no one that could walk away from this believing that he is innocent ,  beth twitty told abc . twitty described the video as a source of  comfort ,  saying  it means everything .   i felt that it put an end to my nightmare ,  she said .  the nightmare is not knowing , and i feel as if now , i can begin the mourning and the healing process for losing a child .  she added ,  not knowing is the absolute cruelest thing that a person can endure .  van der sloot 's attorney , joe tacopina , told abc monday that  there 's no confession , there 's no admission of a crime by joran on any of these tapes .  he said much of what was in the video is  easily disprovable based on corroborative evidence . ... the fact of the matter is he still is not responsible . the evidence , not joran , the evidence , says he 's not responsible for natalee 's death .  tacopina added ,  i 'm certainly not asking at this point for anyone to believe joran . ... clearly his credibility is zero .  last week , van der sloot called the dutch television program  pauw & witteman  and acknowledged having made the comments but said they were lies .  that is what he wanted to hear , so i told him what he wanted to hear ,  van der sloot said . a judge denied a prosecution request that van der sloot , the son of a lawyer , be detained in the netherlands , where he is a student . the judge did determine that sufficient reason exists to reopen the inquiry against van der sloot . watch cnn 's frederik pleitgen report on the new video  mos said that on tuesday he will appeal the judge 's decision barring van der sloot 's arrest and said that a three-judge panel will have eight days to rule on it . in a statement , the office of the public prosecutor on sunday cautioned the report does not necessarily solve the case .  there is a big difference between the reality of a courtroom and the reality of a television screen ,  it said . watch a cnn legal analyst discuss the holloway case  on monday , tacopina said at least two points of his client 's story could be disproved . he said the aruban coast guard had checked the pay phone where van der sloot said he had called his friend , and the records show that  there 's no such call .  also , tacopina said , the friend whom his client names in the video met van der sloot two months ago , and the friend was n't in aruba in may 2005 . he also has never owned a boat , the attorney said . van der eem told abc he befriended van der sloot by pretending to be a gangster after meeting him in a casino .  why did i want this ? it 's obvious . everybody was looking for the truth . for her mother ,  he said . in the interview with abc , van der eem became emotional himself while saying that van der sloot talked about holloway 's death  without any emotions .  van der eem , who abc reported once spent a year in prison on drug charges , said he and van der sloot smoked marijuana on long car rides over the course of several months . van der eem told the network he pretended to invite van der sloot into a drug operation to gain his trust . he approached reporter peter r. de vries ' television show , telling them he had gained van der sloot 's trust , and the program outfitted an suv with hidden video cameras . van der eem has been paid about $ 35,000 by the show -- which has a format similar to the u.s. show  america 's most wanted .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
