{"text": "behind the state banquet and smiles from queen elizabeth and british prime minister gordon brown , king abdullah of saudi arabia 's visit to london this week caused a wave of dissent . the uk political elite boycotted events . demonstrators lined the mall . the uk foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son . and just days before he arrived , the saudi king accused british officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in london on july 2005 . whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate . but this was just part of the story . the saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two kingdoms over the last 20 years . saudi arabia is the uk 's largest trading partner in the middle east . and behind the usa , the uk is the second largest foreign investor in the kingdom . uk trade & investment has designated saudi arabia one of its 17  high growth markets  along with uae and qatar in the region . as the nation diversifies its economy away from oil , commercial opportunities for uk thrive in a variety of sectors . saudi arabia is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities . the $ 26.6 billion king abdullah economic city -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents . the aim , says the saudi arabian general investment authority , is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment , and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities . the uk has , since the early 1990s , been one of the top five exporters to saudi arabia , behind usa , germany , china and japan . in 2007 , saudi arabian bank sabb predicts that uk exports to the kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $ 2.8 billion . while the balance of trade continues to be favor of the british , saudi arabia 's exports to britain are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap . this year , exports to britain are expected to reach a record high of $ 2.1 billion , says sabb . and this is n't all about oil . in the 1980s , three quarters of saudi exports to the uk were from oil , but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports . products being shipped to the uk include machinery , transport equipment , plastics , non-metallic minerals and , despite the uk 's dominance in the sector , chemicals . according to sabb , there are also more than 150 saudi-british joint ventures underway with a value of around $ 15 billion . as john sfakianakis , chief economist from sabb says , state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks , past and future .  the biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 eurofighter typhoon jets that was sealed last week ,  says sfakianakis . the contract between the kingdom and the uk ministry of defence via bae is worth over almost $ 10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $ 19 billion for the deployment , maintenance and training . this comes less than a year after the uk government decided to call off a serious fraud office investigation into defense contracts with saudi arabia . this probe related to the sale of weapons by bae systems to saudi arabia in the 1980s . bae has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to saudi royals to win business . but as sfakianakis points out , any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations .  the relationship is far deeper than that ,  he says .  saudi arabia 's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense . everything else takes a subsidiary part in that .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
