{"text": "buenos aires , argentina argentine farmers are planning their next move after the country 's president announced plans to fund a public works program with revenues from a controversial agrarian export tax . argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner has rejected demands for the repeal of an export tax . eduardo buzzi , president of the argentine agrarian federation , said the organization 's directory board will meet friday to discuss what steps it plans to take in response to president cristina fernandez de kirchner 's announcement .  we call on farmers across the country to stay calm but to stay on the alert ,  the organization said on its web site tuesday . the 44 percent export tax , which applies to soybeans , wheat , corn and sunflower seeds , has caused a three-month-old standoff between the government and farmers . argentina is the world 's second-largest corn exporter and third-largest soybean exporter . on monday , farmers suspended roadblocks that had snarled traffic across the country , though reports indicated that groups in some rural areas were still blocking roads tuesday . kirchner has argued that the tax , which was implemented march 11 , pays for increases in seniors ' pensions and financial assistance for the poor . she has rejected the farmers ' demands for a repeal of the export tax as  extortion .  monday marked the first time kirchner revealed details of how the government plans to use profits from the tax , which has generated about u.s. $ 1.5 billion , to lift people out of poverty .  it is impossible to attack the problem of the poor without distribution of revenue and without touching extraordinary profits ,  she said in a televised address . kirchner said the social redistribution program will include the construction of 30 hospitals and more than 300 health-care centers , as well as investments in the country 's rural roads and in housing . in an apparent criticism of the farmers , she lamented  the reaction of some who refuse to contribute in the redistribution  to  those who have least .  she apologized , however , at the close of her speech for offending anyone . analysts suggested that the tax was a  strong attack  on on the farmers and their arguments against it . claudio loser , a visiting senior fellow at the inter-american dialogue policy analysis center , said it could result in argentine society being  less sympathetic to the farmers ,  noting that it was  surprising  that the government did n't come up with the plan until the tax was three months old . loser , who is from argentina , also predicted that a continuation of the tax would provoke farmers into not investing . externally , the standoff has had a two-pronged effect on argentina , he said .  the conflict has resulted in a loss of market for argentina ,  he said , as other countries have gone elsewhere for products . loser also said foreign investors may be more reluctant to invest in argentina now . cnn 's carolina cayazzo and taylor gandossy contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
