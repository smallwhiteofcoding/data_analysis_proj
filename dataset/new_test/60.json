{"text": "1 . the spam ® museum . spam marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the chinese year of the pig . if the on-site  wall of spam  is any indication , a tour through the spam museum in austin , minnesota , is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family . spam 's parent company , hormel foods , opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of spam . one of the main attractions is a scale model of a spam plant , where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce america 's favorite tinned meat . 2 . national museum of funeral history . it 's pretty hard to argue with the motto  any day above ground is a good one .  so goes the backhanded optimism of the national museum of funeral history , a houston facility that opened in 1992 . visitors are treated to exhibits that include a civil war embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory . in addition , the museum boasts an exhibit of  fantasy coffins  designed by ghanaian artist kane quaye . these moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken , a mercedes-benz , a shallot , and an outboard motor . according to quaye , his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients , which -- let 's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot . 3 . the hobo museum . if you 're bumming around but looking for a good time , be sure to take a load off in britt , iowa , at the hobo museum , which details the history and culture of tramps . bear in mind , though , that the museum kind of , well , slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual hobo convention . luckily , tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year . of course , if you 're interested in the hobo convention , lodging is available all over the area , but it 's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the  hobo jungle ,  located by the railroad tracks . both the event and the museum are operated by the hobo foundation , which -- incidentally -- also oversees the nearby hobo cemetery , where those who have  caught the westbound  are laid to rest . 4 . the mütter museum . originally , the college of physicians of philadelphia erected the mütter museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena . -lrb- you know , babies with two heads , that sort of thing . -rrb- . but today , it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque . there , you 'll find the world 's largest colon , removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation . also on display : an ob-gyn instrument collection , thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens , and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects . 5 . the barnum museum . what better way to honor  greatest show on earth  founder p.t. barnum than with a mediocre museum in bridgeport , connecticut ? some visitors will appreciate the museum 's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus . but only circus freaks -lrb- and by that we mean  enthusiasts  -rrb- will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of barnum 's 40-inch-tall sidekick , general tom thumb . 6 . the conspiracy museum . there 's more than one theory about the assassination of john f. kennedy , so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well ? most jfk buffs are familiar with the sixth floor museum housed in the former texas school book depository , which recounts all those boring  mainstream  details of the late president 's life leading up to his death at the hands of lee harvey oswald . but just down the street , the conspiracy museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into the man 's propaganda . for the most part , the museum specializes in showings of the zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories , including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement . 7 . the museum of questionable medical devices . take two trips to the museum of questionable medical devices and call us when you 've lost all faith in the medical profession . thanks to curator bob mccoy -lrb- who recently donated the collection to the science museum of minnesota -rrb- , those in search of history 's quack science can find what they 're looking for in the st. paul tourist attraction , whether it 's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers . if you make the trip , be sure to check out the 1930s mcgregor rejuvenator . this clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies , sans head , in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process . 8 . cook 's natural science museum . what began as a training facility for cook 's pest control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest . at cook 's natural science museum in decatur , alabama , visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats , cockroaches , mice , spiders , and termites ... all for free . and while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them , museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing pest of the month keep reeling in patrons . 9 . vent haven ventriloquist museum . so , what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville ? the vent haven ventriloquist museum , of course -- where dummies go to die . the fort mitchell , kentucky , museum was the brainchild of the late william shakespeare berger , who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets . in fact , he collected figures from some of the country 's most famous ventriloquist acts . and with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling , you 're bound to feel like you 're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one . but sadly , when berger gave the tour , you could totally tell his mouth was moving . 10 . the trash museum . mom was n't kidding when she said one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . at the trash museum in hartford , connecticut , the connecticut resources recovery authority -lrb- crra -rrb- turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment ! t . our the temple of trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump . and for your recycler-in-training , head across the state to the children 's garbage museum , where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile , get a glimpse of the 1-ton trash-o-saurus , or enjoy the company of resident compost worms . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
