{"text": "ever find yourself struggling to craft the perfect sentence for a loved one who 's , um , serving a sentence ? now , you have a friend in the greeting card business . terrye cheathem has created a line of greeting cards geared toward prison inmates . a los angeles , california , lawyer has come up with a series of cards geared toward prison inmates , a rapidly growing segment of the u.s. population . some express simple good wishes :  we are all praying for you while you do your time .  others celebrate holidays :  you had the choice to be ` naughty or nice . ' and you chose ... now you have to do your time . but , christmas wo n't be the same without you here .  others dole out tough love :  when you called last time , i was not very sympathetic . i guess that i have heard your promises to change too many times . please - stop promising to change . just do it .  creator terrye cheathem said the cards let family members say  look , things need to be different when you get out .  she came up with the idea a few years ago while looking -- without success -- for a birthday card to send her brother-in-law , who was serving an 11-month sentence .  there are so many people who have mixed feelings about communicating with their loved ones in prison ,  cheathem said thursday .  they are unhappy , oftentimes profoundly embarrassed . people do n't know what to say .  so she created three squares greetings to capture the sentiments for a captive audience -- one that seems to be getting larger each year . more than 2.3 million people were in jails or prisons in the united states at the beginning of 2008 , according to a study released last month by the pew center on the states . the center is a private organization that advocates for alternative programs to alleviate prison populations . for the first time in the nation 's history , the center says , more than one in 100 americans are behind bars , a higher proportion than any other country . cheathem is selling her cards online and through stores . she also wants jails and prisons to carry cards designed for inmates to send their relatives .  they 're ` thank you ' cards ,  she said .  ` thank you for visiting , ' ` thank you for bringing the kids , ' ` thank you for coming to court . '  like many , bookstore owner james fugate was at first reluctant to carry the line in his los angeles shop , esowon books .  i have some issues of being nice to criminals ,  fugate said .  and in my 20 years in business , i 've seen some relatives who do n't seem to realize the gravity of what -lrb- their family members -rrb- have done .  fugate said he changed his mind when he realized that most of the cards carried messages asking inmates to turn their lives around . cheathem understands the hesitation of shoppers and sellers .  i ca n't think of any other product that anyone wants to receive and certainly no one wants to be in the position to buy one ,  she said .  but there is a need for this .  cheathem points to mayor kwame kilpatrick of detroit , michigan . he was charged this week with perjury , obstruction of justice and misconduct of office . he was released on a $ 75,000 bond .  i have a card that says , ` i 'm sorry to hear about your arrest , '  she said .  right now , there are probably 50 people or more who would send it to him .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
