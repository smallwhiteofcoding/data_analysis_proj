{"text": "serie a champions inter milan have confirmed the dismissal of coach roberto mancini , opening the way for former chelsea manager jose mourinho to replace him . mancini guided inter milan to the italian league title for three successive seasons . ironically , the 43-year-old mancini , who guided inter to three successive italian league titles , is now the favorite to take mourinho 's former job at stamford bridge . inter -- who won the first of their three titles in 2006 because those above them were demoted or deducted points over the matchfixing scandal -- released a statement about the sacking .  inter milan have informed roberto mancini that he has been relieved of his role as coach , especially because of his comments that he was not going to stay after the end of the season following the champions league tie against liverpool on march 11 ,  read their statement . mancini , however , rescinded those comments the following day declaring that he had made them in the heat of the moment following inter 's elimination from the competition , losing 3-0 on aggregate . inter 's reasons for sacking mancini appear less credible after club president massimo moratti announced that the coach had changed his mind about leaving at the end of the season .  i 've had a talk with mancini , who confirmed to me that he wanted to stay at inter next year to see out his contract . he wants to win the champions league for us next season ,  moratti said on march 12 .  mancini 's words surprised me , i did n't expect it and even less so i believe the people close to him .  mourinho , nicknamed ` the special one ' for guiding porto to the champions league in 2004 and then chelsea to two premier league titles , would not come cheap , but the exit of mancini has cost inter dear too as his contract , which runs till 2012 , will leave him 24 million euros richer as compensation . however , mancini was unable to make inter into viable champions league contenders despite the three serie a titles . mancini is the ninth coaching casualty under moratti , following ottavio bianchi , roy hodgson , luigi simoni , mircea lucescu , marcello lippi , marco tardelli , hector cuper and alberto zaccheroni .", "summary": "no summary"}
