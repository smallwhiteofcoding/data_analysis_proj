{"text": "atlanta , georgia it was an image that got the nation talking : two giggling young women in oversized sunglasses robbing a bank . the  barbie bandits  helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation 's bank robbery capital . here one of the so-called  barbie bandits  is captured on surveillance video at a surburban atlanta bank . atlanta 's fbi field division topped los angeles in reporting the most bank heists , with 350 for the 12 months ending september 30 , 2007 , according to the fbi , which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies . the los angeles area was no. 2 with 338 heists , followed by philadelphia with 316 . just thursday , two suspects overpowered a security guard at an atlanta , georgia , bank , took his gun , robbed the bank and fled with money in hand , police said . eventually , police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire . two more armed bank robberies took place in metro atlanta friday . the fbi says violent crime is up across the nation , especially in major metro areas like atlanta . so it 's no surprise atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies , fbi spokesman stephen emmett told cnn . watch hotlanta or heistlanta ?   this goes hand in hand with those figures ,  emmett said . atlanta 's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor . a recent atlanta business chronicle article reported that metro atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of north carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region . see photos of bank heists in metro atlanta   we would attribute a lot of that -lsb- bank robberies -rsb- to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area ,  emmett said . atlanta 's rise in bank heists comes just as los angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies . los angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year 's 338 , the fbi stats show . according to the fbi , its atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the  barbie bandits  and  grandpa bandit  robberies . the fbi says 122 of the heists were armed robberies , or robberies where a weapon was visibly used . emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as  note jobs  -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller . also factored into the total number of robberies were atm heists and a record nine armored car robberies . those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to emmett .  anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he 's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture , that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement ,  he said . while emmett said there is no  typical  bank robber , he said he has seen some trends , most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions . he also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders . two recent high-profile cases in atlanta seem to confirm that . two women dubbed the  barbie bandits  were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a bank of america in the atlanta suburb of acworth . they both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems . recently apprehended 69-year-old bobby joe phillips , dubbed the  grandpa bandit ,  is suspected to have robbed seven banks in tennessee and the atlanta area and had a criminal history . emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist . joe brannen , president of the georgia bankers association , agrees , saying  the average is $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 . it 's not as big a payoff as most people think it is .  with the holidays in full swing , authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash .  i would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased -lsb- financial -rsb- pressures this time of year ,  said brannen . the fbi advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves , hats and sunglasses . but brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic .  we 've chosen not to go there . here in atlanta , lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes . this is a free and open society ,  he said . he said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers , not bank robbers . brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank 's need for security .  there is no good , magic solution .  he says . emmett said as long as metro atlanta continues to grow , so will the number of bank robberies .  this is something that is part of growth . we have more banks . we have more people . we 're a big city now .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's rusty dornin contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
