{"text": "meals ready to eat , or mres are used by the military to provide nutritious and compact meals for the troops . the meals spark memories good and bad , for those who ate them in the military and even for some civilians who used them during disasters , when food was not readily available . harald schweizer was 19 when this photo was taken in the summer of 1968 in vietnam . he is holding a c ration . cnn.com readers shared their stories and memories of mres and c rations . some of the responses have been edited for clarity and length . here is a selection : . michael reimers of gresham , oregon mres are the fancy ones . we had c rations . probably left over from wwii ! for my 21st birthday in 1982 i was on border patrol at the czech border and my friends snuck in two beers and made a cake for me out of what was available . they took a fruitcake that was in something like a tuna can tin and they mixed hot chocolate mix with grape jelly to make the frosting and added a candle and two german beers and we were in business out in the woods . it was very cool being with all my buddies and them doing that for me . ronald mervyn of burton , michigan i served in the army from april 1985 to february 1988 . mres were not all that bad . i liked the chicken ala king , the dehydrated potatoes patty and the chocolate chip cookies the best . they were all edible . i wish i could have brought some home to share with family and friends . steven carrigan of salina , kansas i served in the u.s. marine corps . did i eat mres ? you bet and a lot of them . they get the job done but always needed a bit of spicing up , tabasco sauce that someone would bring to the field , usually . cold weather affected them more than anything . nothing worse than getting the beans and franks in cold weather . the beans would be semi-hard and the franks rock solid . the preservative that they are in gels up and looks like petroleum jelly . had to carry them next to your body to get them warm . to me the worst one was the chicken ala king , disgusting . the desserts were always good . some guys had recipes that you could mix together two or three mres and have a pretty good meal if you had heat and the time to cook it . even though i thought i left them behind when i left the military , i still have them in the car during the winter and when i do ice fishing . they are great in a pinch . annette sweet of leavenworth , kansas this is a different side of life all together ; i believe the best memories were how to heat your mre before they came out with the heating pouch . spaghetti , wow that was a good one , the best way to serve it was to take your mre cheese , a mini bottle of the tabasco that came in the pack and mix it all together and place on the hood of your humvee on a hot day or by the heater on a cold day . umm good . now , the worst ever that i believe they came out with was the loaf , i ca n't even say whether it was meat or vegetables but it really left a very heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach . you can never forget the ham slices ; unfortunately they forgot to slice it , it was about 1/2 inch thick filled with gristle and very salty , very hard to digest . the different assortments of all the mres were , as i call them , charms candy , hard as a rock and stuck to your teeth ; tootsie roll , huge and did n't taste like chocolate ; chicklet gum , send you straight to the throne ; the peanut butter and crackers , well , a bit oily but i considered a keeper . oh , by the way , they did have real coffee . i believe it was tasters choice , not sure though . and fruit loaf , what can you say about a loaf ? once a loaf , always a loaf , and staying with tradition of blended items , you mixed a pack of the powered cream they gave you for the coffee in with just a smidgen of water and you had peaches ala mode . i never went hungry , but sometimes i never was full . i have retired now and have come to appreciate what is good food . it 's being a civilian , sitting at a real table , with silverware , plate and glass , looking back on where i came from and knowing that i ca n't go back in body but in spirit . from a retired soldier , just keeping it real . to all my comrades that came before me , with me and after me , god bless you and thank you for all that you do . suzanne yeltnuh of ahwatukee , arizona i was a victim of hurricanes jeanne , frances and wilma . we had no power for 21 days and the stores were out of food . i stood in lines for hours for ice and mres and was very thankful . i actually think they are very good ! now that i moved to arizona , at least i do n't have to worry about hurricanes!watch as civilians taste mres . clarence ragland of tucson , arizona i not only had mres , but i also had their predecessor , the c ration ! c-rats , as they were called , came with a can opener called a p-38 , and were ok . the mre has come a long way since its inception , and the chicken ala king was one of the best . still have some at home , although i retired from the air force in 2000 . megan sterrett of apo , new york while i was in the middle east in support of operation enduring freedom , i sent an mre to my children so they could see what they were like . my daughter , who was in the second grade , took it in to school for show and tell . one of the girls in the class declared that she would rather eat sand , to which my daughter replied ,  well you can chose to eat this or choose to die .  it 's always interesting to get a child 's perspective on things . you never know what they will come up with.explore the history of u.s. combat rations . gary burton of clarksville , tennessee my father served in vietnam and related this story to me about the old c rations they were served to eat . he said the canned sponge cake was an  acquired taste ,  so instead of eating it , they opened a petcock valve on the nearby helicopters and filled the cake and tin with aircraft fuel . when lit , the sponge cake would burn for hours and allow the men to heat the rest of their meal with it . david hollingsworth of baltimore , maryland i was a member of the 18th airborne corps f.a. b 5/8th artillery in august 1990 ; among the first troops from fort bragg to deploy in that area . mres were considered pretty ok meals to eat until my unit was linked in a special mission with the french troops . their rations were of something that came off of our dinner tables . -lrb- real food ! -rrb- we would trade them every night for food until they realized what the big fuss was all about . i know real sardines and things of that nature might not sound as appetizing as other foods . however , compared to the mres we were eating , the french troops ' food was a delicacy to most . mark grocki of birmingham , michigan i have not served in the military , but i have eaten mres on backpacking trips through michigan provided to me by a friend 's cousin who serves in the marines . i 've always looked forward to them , and have found the entrees like mexican rice , beef stew , and ham and cheese omelets rather tasty . the crackers and various snack items are good on the go , too , but do n't drink the water from the heating element ! when asked by other people ,  what do they taste like ?  i have only one word for them .  freedom .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
