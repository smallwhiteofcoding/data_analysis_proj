this is his time .  georgia voters head to the polls february 5 . in new york , hillary clinton spent sunday morning at another historic black church , harlem 's abyssinian baptist church , where she picked up the endorsement of its pastor , the rev. calvin butts . butts said outside the church :  a vote for hillary clinton is a vote to elect someone who has proven through time to me and to this community and this country that she has the experience to make things happen , and the vision to return us to a place of prosperity .  clinton also sounded a conciliatory note sunday .  i have the highest regard and admiration for my friend and colleague sen. barack obama . i am honored to be running with him ,  she said .  i hope that this election remains focused on the big challenges that confront us .  after a distant third-place finish in the nevada caucuses , edwards on sunday made light of his performance . on cnn 's  late edition with wolf blitzer ,  edwards said he hopes  what happens in vegas stays in vegas ,  admitting ,  i got my butt kicked .  edwards would like to rebound in south carolina , his native state . he won the primary there in 2004 when he was making his first bid for the white house . but he 's running a distant third in most recent surveys in south carolina , behind obama and clinton . on sunday , edwards sounded a cautious note , saying south carolina was important but just one  part of the long process . ... we will see how it goes .  also on  late edition ,  the house majority whip , rep. james clyburn , d-south carolina , cited the timing of the debate to help put the spotlight on issues important to blacks . clyburn , the highest ranking african-american in congress , was instrumental in having monday 's debate held in south carolina .  when we were dealing with the dates of the primary , we tried to work in the symbolism that it would have to all of the world , for that matter , to have this debate on martin luther king jr.
