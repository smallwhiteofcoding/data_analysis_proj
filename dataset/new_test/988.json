{"text": "in  street kings ,  keanu reeves ' bad-boy cop tom ludlow may not play by the rules , but the film sure does . keanu reeves , second from left , and forest whitaker are shifty cops in  street kings .  the movie is textbook cop noir . directed by david ayer , who wrote  training day  and directed  harsh times ,  from a script that originated with  l.a. confidential  novelist james ellroy , it 's a story both men have told before and will doubtless return to again . too bad that story -- the one about the constant struggle with an impure world , betrayal , disillusionment , retribution , all that jazz -- is n't told with much originality this time around . as ludlow , a detective with a special lapd vice squad , reeves shoots first and asks questions much , much later . in his field the bad guys are easy to spot , and if tom has to get his hands dirty , well , then he 'll be careful to wipe away the residue before he calls it in . he works from the gut . we have ludlow 's number from the beginning : he wakes up , vomits , cleans his gun , and knocks back a couple of miniature bottles of vodka . then he crashes a kidnappers ' den and puts down four gangsters before they know what 's hit them .  do n't worry ,  he tells the distraught little girls caged up in the back .  i 'm a cop .  it 's probably superfluous to add that he 's still nursing a grievous hangover from the wife who died in flagrante with a person unknown two or three years ago . it 's also probably superfluous to mention that internal affairs -lrb- headed by hugh laurie -rrb- is beginning to sniff around ludlow 's unit . in particular , ia is talking to his ex-partner washington -lrb- terry crews -rrb- , a revelation that sends ludlow reaching for his baseball bat . before he can put washington straight , though , his old pal is gunned down before his eyes by a couple of punks . can ludlow cover up his own potentially incriminating presence at the scene and still track down the cop killers ? hell , yes , even if he has to alienate everyone in the department before he 's through . reeves does n't do much  acting  as such , but he does n't need to : his performance is clean and spare , in synch with ayer 's clipped economy , and he has a doleful quality that goes some way to redeem a nasty and wretchedly na√Øve character . alcoholism does n't appear to have thrown off ludlow 's aim any , but it must have dulled his reasoning . a broody , intuitive detective should be able to piece together this boilerplate mystery without too much head-scratching , but ludlow never stops to look even two steps ahead . -lrb- i guess he 's not a james ellroy fan . -rrb- . but what he lacks in insight he makes up for in sheer determination , not to say blood-lust . in a neat touch , when it 's time to cool off his public profile for a spell , the rogue cop is transferred to a desk in the complaints department -- surely his idea of purgatory , and , obviously , an utterly pointless occupation . forest whitaker boosts the energy level as ludlow 's paternalistic mentor , boss , and no. 1 fan :  you 're the tip of the spear ,  he tells him .  who else is going to hold back the animals ?  violent and cynical and a shade or two overdetermined ,  street kings  ably demonstrates the pitfalls embedded in the pragmatics of  a necessary evil ,  or anyone who sets himself up as a law unto himself , but ultimately it ca n't conceive of a better alternative . after all , the rest is politics , a game that even the most hard-boiled anti-hero would never lower himself to enter . and , besides , he 's seen it before .  street kings  is rated r and runs 107 minutes . for entertainment weekly 's take , click here . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
