{"text": "baghdad , iraq iraqi representatives will meet with the international olympic committee on monday to try to reach an agreement that would allow now-banned iraq to participate in next month 's games , an official said friday . iraq fans cheer during an olympic qualifying soccer match against australia in november . jassim m. jaffer , iraq 's minister of youth and sports , told cnn he is  optimistic that we will participate .  iraqi government spokesman ali al-dabbagh and the ministry 's adviser , basil abdul mahdi , are on their way to lausanne , switzerland , to meet with ioc officials , jaffer said . the ioc barred iraq from participating in the olympic summer games in beijing , china , citing what it said was government interference with iraq 's olympic movement . the ioc 's charter does not allow political interference . the ban stems from the iraqi government decision in may to suspend the country 's existing olympic committee and form a new entity . watch an official explain the decision  but even as government representatives traveled to switzerland , jaffer said iraq was considering legal action against the ioc .  we will revert to international courts with a complaint against the ioc ... to get iraq 's rights and the rights of the athletes ,  jaffer said . on friday , another iraqi government official said the country was doing what it could to reverse the ban , but acknowledged that  chances are slim  for a change . basam ridha al-husseini , an adviser to prime minister nuri al-maliki , told cnn the government has been in  heavy negotiations  with ioc officials through the asian olympic committee .  the iraqi government will not give up on our participation , which is still needed by our people ,  he said in a phone interview from dubai .  we are doing our best to stop the ban . ... the chances of that are slim , but we will persevere and hope it will happen .  repeated attempts by cnn to reach the ioc press office in switzerland for comment were unsuccessful . but on thursday , ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau said the ioc in june suspended iraq 's national olympic committee after the government removed elected officials and put in people not recognized by the ioc . she said the ioc had proposed to the iraqi government that officials come to the ioc headquarters in lausanne , switzerland ,  to discuss possible solutions .   we 're extremely disappointed with the situation ,  moreau said .  the athletes have been ill-served by the government in iraq .  iraq missed a wednesday deadline for the entry of athletes to compete in archery , judo , rowing and weightlifting , moreau said . she said there is a chance that track and field athletes could compete if the original committee is reinstated . the deadline for the track team to register is at the end of the month . jaffer , iraq 's sports minister , told cnn on friday that the ioc 's decision was  unjust  because it did not take into consideration the iraqi government 's reasons for the may suspension . the minister called on the ioc to come to iraq and talk to the sports federation to investigate the political interference accusations , and then act accordingly .  looking at this from far away , without going into the details , not reading the iraqi government 's reports , not hearing iraq 's side of the story and accusing iraq of many things is really unfortunate ,  he said . several iraqi athletes were to travel to china for the games ' start in august . iraqi sprinter dana hussain cried for hours after hearing the news of the ban on thursday , which arrived in the form of a letter to iraqi officials .  she has n't stopped . it 's like finding out that a close relative has died ,  said her coach , yousif abdul rahman . abdul rahman attempted to console hussain by assuring her that she could compete in the 2012 olympics . watch hussain react to the news   in this horrible situation ,  she said ,  who can say i 'll even be alive in 2012 ?  al-husseini said iraq had the right as a sovereign nation to suspend the olympic committee , which he accused of documented corruption . it was not clear where the committee 's funds were going and they  could be ending up in the hands of terrorists ,  he said .  we are satisfied with the decision ... stand by it and we are not going to change an order by -lsb- prime minister -rsb- al-maliki and the cabinet . ... never ,  he said . he was asked whether iraq would consider doing what yugoslavia did in the 1992 winter olympics when it was banned -- sending individual athletes and not raising the national flag . al-husseini said that would be an option , but al-maliki rejected it . al-husseini said that iraq had been banned from taking part in the 1990 olympics during the saddam hussein-era because of the invasion of kuwait . the 1990 ban , enacted by the olympic council of asia , actually was a ban on participation in the asian games , a regional olympics-related event . iraq participated in the 1992 olympics in barcelona , the first games held after the kuwait invasion . cnn 's jomana karadsheh and morgan neill contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
