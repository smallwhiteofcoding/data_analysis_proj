2 . treating autism . point out to students that , although autistic symptoms in children may lessen with age , autism is a lifelong disorder . there are various types of therapies available for treating autism , including behavior modification , sensory integration , medications and dietary interventions . however , because the nature and severity of autistic symptoms and behaviors can vary , no one approach works for every person . according to the national institute of mental health , most professionals agree that early intervention is important and that most individuals with asd respond well to highly structured , specialized programs . after you have shared this information , pair students and assign each pair one of the following asd treatment approaches : . biomedical treatments . -lrb- cnn does not endorse any specific medication . the information provided here is meant as an overview of the types of medications sometimes prescribed . -rrb- . instruct each pair to investigate the philosophy , protocols and benefits and drawbacks associated with its treatment method . have pairs deliver presentations of their findings . -lrb- if possible , have the students who are presenting behavior modification approaches demonstrate the techniques , and have the students who are speaking about medications and dietary interventions include graphics that depict how the treatments are thought to affect the different parts of the human body . -rrb- following the presentations , pose the following questions for class discussion : . extension : have students draw upon thier research to create an informational brochure about asd for parents and local mental health providers . keywords . sue rubin , autism spectrum disorders , pervasive developmental disorder , mental retardation , non-verbal , disability , relationships , self-abusive behaviors , motor skills , emotions , learning , language , communication system , sensory integration , echolalia , independent living , hud , support services , whittier college , intelligence , neurobiology , dr. margaret bauman , advocate , documentary e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
