{"text": "dubai a court in dubai sentenced two men wednesday to 15 years in prison for the rape and kidnapping of a 15-year-old french boy . veronique robert , mother of the 15-year-old french-swiss teen , speaking outside a court in dubai . the boy 's mother , veronique robert , was visibly upset after the sentence was read and promised to appeal . robert , a french journalist , brought the case to the media 's attention in recent months in an effort to shed light on what she deemed to be injustices in the pro-western emirate of dubai . robert said wednesday 's sentence was too lenient for a crime that she believes is tantamount to attempted murder because one of her son 's attackers was knowingly hiv-positive at the time of the rape . she refrained from asking the death penalty for her son 's attackers , but said she hoped the sentence would be much longer . a spokesman for the dubai government , habib al mulla , told cnn the sentence was in accordance with international standards and was not lenient .  today 's verdict has proven that the system is efficient and is fair to all parties involved ,  al mulla said . the case began in july , when the two men , 36 and 18 , kidnapped and raped the french teenager at knifepoint . robert contacted french diplomats , who took up the allegations with dubai authorities . al mulla said police action was swift and arrests were made within 24 hours . but robert has said the case was botched from the start , beginning with her son 's examination by a doctor who said her son was gay . homosexuality in dubai is illegal , and the teen could have faced as much as a year in prison . robert 's son has since returned to france and was not in court for wednesday 's sentencing . robert has also said dubai authorities repeatedly concealed evidence -- confirmed in court papers -- that one of the attackers was hiv-positive . robert said her son , who is still awaiting test results to find out whether he has the virus , could have gotten treatment much sooner had they known . dubai authorities deny any evidence was concealed . the case has shed light on dubai 's attitudes toward rape and homosexuality , which some western observers have said is outdated . al mulla , however , said wednesday 's sentencing and the government 's handling of the case proves the country 's system works .  it 's today 's verdict which proves that there is a system ,  al mulla said .  the system is working properly . however , if there is any room for any improvement in the system , we 'll definitely look into it , consider it , and if there 's any room for improvement , we 'll implement it .  the mother has already filed suit in courts in paris and geneva , switzerland seeking compensation from sheikh khalifa , president of the united arab emirates , and the prime minister and vice president of dubai , sheikh mohammed al maktoum . she is also suing others , including the dubai police chief . robert started a web site over the summer , boycottdubai.com , demanding better treatment for children who suffer sexual assault there . at a press conference last month , she proclaimed ,  we are here because i just would like first justice for my son ; and second for every girl and boy who was raped and even had no chance to speak .  robert said she will drop all her pending cases if the government sets up rape clinics , recognizes the status of rape victims , and takes precautions after rape against sexually-transmitted diseases . in the wake of wednesday 's verdict , robert said a dubai government official told her the emirate plans to open its first rape clinic , which she said was a small victory . the government has not yet officially announced its plans to open such a facility . al mulla told cnn that dubai believes a reception center for rape victims is  a good solution .   we are considering it ,  he said , regarding robert 's request .  we believe it 's good . it 's good for the victims , and it 's good for the whole system .  e-mail to a friend . cnn correspondent wilf dinnick contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
