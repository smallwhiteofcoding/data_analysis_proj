{"text": "erik prince , the chairman and ceo of blackwater usa , appeared tuesday before the house committee on oversight and government reform . erik prince , ceo and chairman of blackwater usa , is sworn in tuesday at a congressional hearing . the committee convened amid an fbi investigation into a september 16 shootout involving blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of iraqi civilians . following is a transcript of prince 's opening statement : . chairman -lsb- henry -rsb- waxman , -lsb- d-california -rsb- , congressman -lsb- thomas -rsb- davis , -lsb- r-virginia -rsb- , members of the committee , my name is eric prince , and i am the chairman and ceo of the prince group and blackwater usa . blackwater 's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to america 's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect americans in harm 's way overseas . under the direction and oversight of the united states government , blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the united states . words alone can not express the respect i have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend u.s. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions . i am proud to be there to represent them today . after almost five years in active service as a u.s. navy seal , i founded blackwater in 1997 . i wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues . ten years later , blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the united states military and law enforcement agencies every day . after 9/11 , when the u.s. began its stabilization efforts in afghanistan and then iraq , the united states government called upon blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas . blackwater responded immediately . we are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country . blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans , many of whom have recent military deployments . no individual ever protected by blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured . there is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men . at the same time , 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for blackwater and its affiliates . numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed . the entire blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives . our thoughts and our prayers are with their families . the areas of iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging . blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within iraq . we 're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 american military personnel and thousands of innocent iraqis . any incident where americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep american officials and dignitaries safe , including visiting members of congress . in doing so , more american service members are available to fight the enemy . blackwater shares the committee 's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting u.s. operations . the company 's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes , treaties and regulations of the united states . blackwater looks forward to working with congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented . the worldwide personnel protection services contract , which has been provided to this committee , was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance , including the hiring , vetting guidelines , background checks , screening , training standards , rules of force and conduct standards . in iraq , blackwater reports to the embassy 's regional security officer , or rso . all blackwater movements and operations are directed by the rso . in conjunction with internal company procedures and controls , the rso ensures that blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions , as well as any applicable laws and regulations . we have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in iraq as part of our nation 's total force . blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions . my understanding of the september 16 incident is that the department of state and the fbi are conducting a full investigation , but those results are not yet available . we at blackwater welcome the fbi review announced yesterday , and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions . i just want to put some other things in perspective . a recent report from the department of state stated that in 2007 blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone , areas outside the green zone in iraq , and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged , or less than 3 percent of all movements . in 2006 , blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the red zone . weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions . to the extent there is any loss of innocent life , ever , let me be clear that i consider that tragic . every life , whether american or iraqi , is precious . i stress to the committee and to the american public , however , that i believe we acted appropriately at all times . i am prepared to answer your questions . e-mail to a friend .",
