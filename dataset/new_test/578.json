{"text": "washington in what he called a  defining moment for our nation ,  sen. barack obama on tuesday became the first african-american to head the ticket of a major political party . sen. barack obama on tuesday told supporters he will be the democratic nominee . obama 's steady stream of superdelegate endorsements , combined with the delegates he received from tuesday 's primaries , put him past the 2,118 threshold , cnn projects .  tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another -- a journey that will bring a new and better day to america ,  he said .  tonight , i can stand before you and say that i will be the democratic nominee for president of the united states .  watch obama say he 'll be the nominee  obama 's rally was at the xcel energy center in st. paul , minnesota -- the same arena which will house the 2008 republican national convention in september . speaking in new york , sen. hillary clinton , congratulated obama for his campaign , but she did not concede the race nor discuss the possibility of running as vice president .  this has been a long campaign , and i will be making no decisions tonight ,  she said . watch clinton congratulate obama  there were reports earlier in the day that she would concede , but her campaign said she was  absolutely not  prepared to do so . two new york lawmakers also told cnn on tuesday that during a conference call clinton expressed willingness to serve as obama 's running mate in november . watch the latest on a possible joint ticket  ' one source told cnn that clinton told those on the call that if asked by obama , she would be interested in serving as his running mate . one of the lawmakers said clinton 's husband , former president bill clinton , has been pushing the idea privately for several weeks . the clinton campaign maintains the new york senator merely said she would do whatever is in the party 's best interest , and that her comments tuesday are no different than what she has been saying for weeks . clinton said she would meet with supporters and party leaders in the coming days to determine her next steps . she also asked people to go to her web site to  share your thoughts with me and help in any way that you can .  watch what could be in store in clinton 's future  cnn has projected that clinton will win the primary in south dakota and obama will take montana . those states marked the final contests in the primary season . obama praised clinton 's campaign . he has been speaking favorably of the new york senator as his focus has turned toward the general election and his battle against john mccain , the presumptive gop presidential nominee .  sen. hillary clinton has made history in this campaign not just because she 's a woman who has done what no woman has done before , but because she 's a leader who inspires millions of americans with her strength , her courage , and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight ,  he said . diving into general election mode , obama turned his attacks to mccain , saying it 's  time to turn the page on the policies of the past .   while john mccain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past , such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign ,  he said .  it 's not change when john mccain decided to stand with george bush 95 percent of the time , as he did in the senate last year .  earlier tuesday night , mccain portrayed himself as the candidate of  right change .   no matter who wins this election , the direction of this country is going to change dramatically . but the choice is between the right change and the wrong change , between going forward and going backward ,  he said in kenner , louisiana . cnn 's candy crowley , jim acosta , suzanne malveaux , paul steinhauser and robert yoon contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
