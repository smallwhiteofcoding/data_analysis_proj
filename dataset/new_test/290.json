{"text": "a 12-year-old boy should get a say in whether he gets circumcised , the oregon supreme court has ruled . the court sent the parental custody dispute back to the trial court  to resolve the factual issue whether m agrees or objects to the circumcision .   m  is the child at the center of a long-running custody dispute between james and lia boldt , who divorced in 1999 . soon after , the father began studying judaism and later converted . he also started teaching his son about the faith . by then , james had parental custody and told his ex-wife the boy would convert as well , and that to do so , he would have to have the circumcision procedure . the mother objected , saying the child had been raised in the russian orthodox faith while the couple was married . because the two sides disagreed , and were living in neighboring states , the conflict dissolved into ongoing personal and constitutional dispute . james boldt said that as a jew and the primary caregiver , he has a first amendment right to practice his faith as he sees fit for his child . lia boldt countered her son does not want to go through with the circumcision , and that it is an invasive , irreversible , and potentially dangerous medical procedure . the state high court seemed especially reluctant to address the issue , saying normally such disputes  are considered private family matters .  but the justices noted  these parties can not or will not resolve this matter without resort to the courts .  so rather than offer a definitive ruling , the justices ordered both sides to go to the actual source of the conflict .  in our view , at age 12 , m 's attitude regarding circumcision , though not conclusive of the custody issue presented here , is a fact necessary to the determination  of whether the mother can press her objections to the procedure , wrote chief justice paul de muniz for the six-member panel .  forcing m at age 12 to undergo circumcision against his will could seriously affect the relationship between m and his father , and could have a pronounced effect on father 's capability to properly care for m.  there was no initial reaction to the decision from the parents or their attorneys . the case is james boldt v. lia boldt -lrb- s054714 -rrb- . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
