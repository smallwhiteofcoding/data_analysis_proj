{"text": "los angeles , california youssif , the 5-year-old burned iraqi boy , rounded the corner at universal studios when suddenly the little boy hero met his favorite superhero . youssif has always been a huge spider-man fan . meeting him was  my favorite thing ,  he said . spider-man was right smack dab in front of him , riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes . the legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted , walked over to youssif and introduced himself . spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug , embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights . he showed youssif a few tricks , like how to shoot a web from his wrist . only this time , no web was spun .  all right youssif !  spider-man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement . other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look . even the green goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi . youssif remained unfazed . he did n't take a liking to spider-man 's nemesis . spidey was just too cool .  it was my favorite thing ,  the boy said later .  i want to see him again .  he then felt compelled to add :  i know it 's not the real spider-man .  this was the day of dreams when the boy 's nightmares were , at least temporarily , forgotten . he met spongebob , lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named archie . the hairy , brownish-red primate took to the boy , grabbing his hand and holding it . even when youssif pulled away , archie would inch his hand back toward the boy 's and then snatch it . see youssif enjoy being a boy again  the boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns . it was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central baghdad , as recently as a week ago . he squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could . he rode a tram through the back stages at universal studios . at one point , the car shook . fire and smoke filled the air , debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle . the boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed .  even i was scared ,  the dad said .  well , i was n't ,  youssif replied . the father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day . youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister , ayaa , in a stroller .  did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here ?  youssif 's father said in amazement .  other than my wedding day , this is the happiest day of my life ,  he said . just a day earlier , the mother and father talked about their journey out of iraq and to the united states . they also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home , doused him in gas and set him on fire . his mother heard her boy screaming from inside . the father sought help for his boy across baghdad , but no one listened . he remembers his son 's two months of hospitalization . the doctors did n't use anesthetics . he could hear his boy 's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital . watch youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister  the father knew that speaking to cnn would put his family 's lives in jeopardy . the possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer , he said .  anything for youssif ,  he said .  we had to do it .  they described a life of utter chaos in baghdad . neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl . shortly afterward , the father was kidnapped and killed . then , there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans . they were snatched off the street by gunmen . the stories can be even more gruesome . the couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded -- and her killers sewed a dog 's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family 's doorstep .  these are just some of the stories ,  said youssif 's mother , zainab . under saddam hussein , there was more security and stability , they said . there was running water and electricity most of the time . but still life was tough under the dictator , like the time when zainab 's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a  religious book ,  she said . sitting in the parking lot of a target in suburban los angeles , youssif 's father watched as husbands and wives , boyfriends and girlfriends , parents and their children , came and went . some held hands . others smiled and laughed .  iraq finished ,  he said in what few english words he knows . he elaborated in arabic : his homeland wo n't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon . it 's just not possible . too much violence . too many killings . his two children have only seen war . but this week , the family has seen a much different side of america -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home .  it 's been a dream ,  the father said . he used to do a lot of volunteer work back in baghdad .  maybe that 's why i 'm being helped now ,  the father said . at universal studios , he looked out across the valley below . the sun glistened off treetops and buildings . it was a picturesque sight fit for a hollywood movie .  good america , good america ,  he said in english . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's arwa damon contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
