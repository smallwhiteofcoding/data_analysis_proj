{"text": "washington jordan 's king hussein sent a secret message to president richard nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack syria , according to declassified documents released wednesday by the former president 's library . president nixon works at his desk in the oval office in a june 1972 photograph . the papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the nixon presidential library , some of which offer harbingers of present-day events , such as concerns about terrorism and saudi arabia . library director timothy naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the saudis more involved in solving the palestinian-israeli conflict , how to get them more engaged against terrorism , how to address the arab view that the united states always sides with israel and how to build up moderate palestinians to counter extremists . a 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective :  isolate and undermine terrorisms -lsb- sic -rsb- and commandos -lsb- sic -rsb- by establishing another , more stable and respectable palestinian political entity and political personality .  documents detail u.s. efforts to persuade saudi arabia to move away from fatah , the military wing of the palestine liberation organization , because u.s. officials believed the plo was supporting the terrorist-linked , anti-israel group black september , referred to as bso . the document , a u.s. state department telegram from the embassy in jeddah to washington reads ,  bso and fatah -lsb- are -rsb- now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty . one might wonder whether central objective bso conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward middle east peace .  the document release was intended to coincide with mideast peace summit among palestinian , israeli and other mideast leaders in maryland , naftali said . the nixon white house also was adjusting to israel 's acquisition of a nuclear weapon .  we are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for richard nixon 's decision in 1969 to accept the fact , a fact of life , that israel had a bomb , a nuclear device ,  said naftali .  that , of course , is very important with what 's going on in annapolis .   even though it is clear from the documents that the united states government did not encourage israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent , it became a fact of life ,  naftali said .  there are materials here that show how our government , 30 years ago , dealt with this very , very difficult problem .  rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power , israel still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability . in 1970 , as king hussein dealt with threats by both palestinian refugees in his country and syrian military forces crossing jordan 's border , the king asked  the united states and great britain to intervene in the war in jordan , asking the united states , in fact , to attack syria ,  naftali said .  syria had invaded jordan and the jordanian king , facing what he felt was a military rout , said please help us in any way possible .  the telegram indicates that hussein himself called a u.s. official at 3 a.m. to ask for american or british help .  situation deteriorating dangerously following syrian massive invasion ... ,  the document said .  i request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence of jordan . immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative .  the library has withheld the nixon documents from public access until wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified , naftali said . nixon served as president from january 20 , 1969 , to august 9 , 1974 , when he resigned under political pressure during the watergate scandal -- the only u.s. president to do so . he died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81 . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
