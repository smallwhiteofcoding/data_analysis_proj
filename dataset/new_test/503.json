{"text": "everyone wants to be more physically fit , but the toughest thing is finding motivation -- the motivation to get started , the motivation to keep going , the motivation to push yourself to the next level . a man tries out the wii fit at a nintendo launch party in central park , new york city . wii fit does n't try to motivate you with before and after photos . it does n't try to motivate you with testimonials from fitness gurus . it does n't even offer you three easy payments . but it does entice you to get into shape by making working out look like fun . and that it does very well . in fact , wii fit might be some of the most fun you can have by just more or less standing still , which must make it about as mass market friendly as any video game product ever was . wii fit requires a wii , of course , and it comes bundled with a balance board . but the entire setup does n't take up much space , and the board is no eyesore , either . unlike a bathroom scale that 's usually squirreled away in a closet or shoved into the corner of a bathroom , looking at it does n't make you feel guilty . designed to fit in with japanese living rooms , where space is usually at a premium , the balance board is sleek and elegantly designed . ireport.com : send us your wii fit review . it conveys cool asian style with a streamlined appearance . it 's something you would n't mind having in your living room at all . one thing about nintendo : they know how to make hardware that 's rugged but easy on the eyes . getting started with wii fit is a snap , but you might have to get some bad news out of the way first . the balance board connects to the wii through a wi-fi connection . you stand on it and use the wii remote to record your height and age . the balance board then registers your weight . from those figures , wii fit calculates your body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- , a standard metric many doctors use to determine a person 's overall fitness , which you can track over time . oddly , however , there 's no easy way to just use the scale to see your weight without recalculating your bmi each time . the wii fit-ness program is organized into 48 activities divided among four general areas : yoga , aerobics , strength training , and balance games . you can choose to work through all four in one session or just concentrate on one . if you 've never tried yoga before , working through the 15 positions here are as good an introduction as any . all of them are done with at least one foot on the balance board , so wii fit can measure how centered you keep your body . yoga is a great way to stretch muscles and joints out and to work on overall flexibility . as meditative as this physical activity would seem , you 'll feel the burn even before you reach any of the advanced forms . once you 're loosened up a little with yoga , you might move on to aerobics . the majority of these nine activities are basically variations of hula hooping , jogging in place , and simple step aerobics . the one exception is rhythm boxing , which you unlock later on . by turning these aerobic challenges all into minigames , wii fit entices you to keep working on them to earn better scores and ratings . with the hula hoop , for example , you have to stand on the board and grind your hips to keep a virtual hoop twirling . later , you have to  catch  tossed hoops , and then keep them all twirling , too . wii fit sets a mellow , steady pace for all its aerobic challenges , but it still manages to make your heart pump . if just the words  push  and  ups  makes you break out in a sweat , then you 've probably already surmised that strength training contains some of the most physically demanding wii fit workouts . the torso twist and rowing squat are easy , but push-ups , planks , and even the lunges will show you what you 're made of . the push-ups in particular make you work extra hard . you do push-ups with your two hands on the board , but because it 's 17 1/2 inches wide , people over six feet tall or with broad shoulders might find themselves with their hands positioned inside their shoulder width . while it 's certainly a worthwhile goal to build up to , it 's difficult to snap off a set of push-ups from that position . the balance games require you to just apply pressure to the board through your feet . skiing slaloms and ski jumping are fairly straightforward , but you can also walk a tightrope or try to float down a river inside a giant bubble . all of these are simple and fun , and they really do make you aware of how well you maintain good posture and keep your balance . however , they are also short and very limited in the variety of levels and layouts . could you do all these exercises and balance activities right now without wii fit ? sure you could . but would you ? that 's where the wii fit balance board comes in . just like the wii itself , it just looks like something you 'd like to try out . but once you take that first step onto it , you might find yourself on the way to becoming more fit . read about video games . watch video game news . play complete , original console , arcade and pc games - free ! visit gametap.com . copyright : tm & Â© 2007 turner broadcasting system , inc. . a time warner company , or its licensors . patent pending . all rights reserved . gametap is part of the turner young adult network .", "summary": "no summary"}
