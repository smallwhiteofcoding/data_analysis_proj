{"text": "hollywood , florida a man serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore has confessed to overpowering and fatally shooting a deputy who was taking him to court wednesday , authorities said . michael mazza , 40 , was arrested outside a pawn shop in hollywood , florida , hours after the death of broward county deputy paul rein sparked a massive manhunt . it was the third shooting of a broward county sheriff 's deputy in four months , and the second fatality . the incident happened as mazza was being taken to the second day of his trial in connection with the armed robbery of a coral springs bank , sheriff al lamberti said . mazza was being transported in a medical van because of a medical condition , lamberti said . the driver 's compartment of the van was separated from the back by a cage or grill . mazza and rein left about 8:05 a.m. , lamberti said . minutes later , a truck driver who saw all or part of the altercation near pompano beach called 911 .  all of this transpired within six minutes . that 's all it took ,  lamberti said . the struggle began when rein apparently pulled the medical transport van over at an intersection . the deputy 's body showed other injuries from the fight -- a broken finger , bruises and cuts , lamberti said . mazza allegedly took rein 's service weapon away from him and shot him , authorities said . although two shots were fired , rein was shot only once , the bullet entering his upper chest and exiting his lower back , lamberti told reporters . after the shooting , mazza is believed to have thrown rein from the van and driven away . a city public works employee later spotted the blood-spattered van in fort lauderdale , lamberti said . mazza , meanwhile , is believed to have hitchhiked his way down to hollywood , about 20 miles away . he approached a man at a pawn shop and asked for a ride . the man , who was headed to a second pawn shop , agreed . when the man arrived at the second pawn shop , he left mazza in the car and went inside , lamberti said . as he was talking to the clerk , a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputy 's shooting , and showed a picture of mazza , he said . the man  tells the clerk , ` hey , i have that guy in my car , '  lamberti said . he went back to the car , took his keys , came back and told the clerk to call police . mazza was arrested shortly afterward . rein 's gun was found with mazza in the man 's car , the sheriff said . mazza faces charges including first-degree murder and escape , lamberti said . he was being interviewed by police wednesday afternoon and was to appear before a judge at some point , he said , and afterward would be transported to dade county jail . because the shooting was  an emotionally charged event for all of us ... we feel it 's probably better that he be housed at another facility outside of broward county ,  lamberti said , and dade county agreed to house him . mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities , but later agreed , and confessed to shooting rein , the sheriff said . he offered no details . lamberti said mazza was serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore in coconut creek , correcting his earlier statement that mazza was serving two life sentences . he was on trial for robbery of the coral springs bank . broward county also has a pending case against mazza -- a february drugstore robbery in pompano beach , he said . mazza was dressed in civilian clothes -- a suit -- rather than jail scrubs wednesday because he had a court date , authorities have said . when caught , however , mazza was wearing a t-shirt , shorts and sneakers , lamberti told reporters . police are investigating whether he had planned the escape in advance and whether anyone helped him . rein 's co-workers told reporters he was  in outstanding condition physically .  the sheriff 's office has fitness-for-duty standards that deputies must meet . broward county deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates , lamberti said . thin staffing and scant resources prevent more than one deputy being involved , he said .  it 's a routine thing ,  lamberti said .  but it shows , in this profession , nothing is routine , whether it be a domestic , a traffic stop or just transporting an inmate to court .  as news of the escape broke , all 273 schools in broward county went on lockdown , according to nadine drew , a spokeswoman for the school system . lamberti said rein 's wife spoke to her husband by cell phone just 10 minutes before he was shot .  she said you never think it 's going to happen to you ,  the sheriff said . the deputy was memorialized wednesday on the web site of the broward county sheriff 's office . visitors to the site were greeted by a photo of rein , with a caption saying ,  husband . father . friend .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
