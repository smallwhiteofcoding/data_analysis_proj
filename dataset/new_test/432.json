{"text": "ip-455 press release 8 february 2008 the findings of a scotland yard inquiry into how mohtarma benazir bhutto died after being attacked during a political rally in rawalpindi were presented to the government of pakistan today . the bomb explodes near bhutto 's vehicle following a political rally in rawalpindi . the conclusions of the inquiry were outlined in a detailed report handed over to interim interior minister hamid nawaz by detective superintendent john macbrayne , accompanied by a senior official from the british high commission , during a meeting in islamabad . the text of the executive summary of the report is as follows : . on the 27th december 2007 , mohtarma benazir bhutto , the leader of the pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , died as a result of being attacked in rawalpindi , pakistan . following discussions between the prime minister and president musharraf , it was agreed that officers from the metropolitan police counter terrorism command -lrb- so15 -rrb- should support the investigation into ms bhutto 's death . the primary focus of the scotland yard team was to assist the pakistani authorities in establishing the cause and circumstances of ms bhutto 's death . the wider investigation to establish culpability has remained entirely a matter for the pakistani authorities . the so15 team was led by a detective superintendent senior investigating officer , and comprised two forensic experts , an expert in analysing and assessing video media and an experienced investigating officer . the team arrived in pakistan on 4th january 2008 and spent two and a half weeks conducting extensive enquiries . during the course of their work , the team were joined by other specialists from the united kingdom . the uk team were given extensive support and co-operation by the pakistani authorities , ms bhutto 's family , and senior officials from ms bhutto 's party . the task of establishing exactly what happened was complicated by the lack of an extended and detailed search of the crime scene , the absence of an autopsy , and the absence of recognised body recovery and victim identification processes . nevertheless , the evidence that is available is sufficient for reliable conclusions to be drawn . within the overall objective , a particular focus has been placed on establishing the actual cause of death , and whether there were one or more attackers in the immediate vicinity of ms bhutto . the cause of death . considerable reliance has been placed upon the x-rays taken at rawalpindi general hospital following ms bhutto 's death . given their importance , the x-rays have been independently verified as being of ms bhutto by comparison with her dental x-rays . additionally , a valuable insight was gained from the accounts given by the medical staff involved in her treatment , and from those members of ms bhutto 's family who washed her body before burial . ms bhutto 's only apparent injury was a major trauma to the right side of the head . the uk experts all exclude this injury being an entry or exit wound as a result of gunshot . the only x-ray records , taken after her death , were of ms bhutto 's head . however , the possibility of a bullet wound to her mid or lower trunk can reasonably be excluded . this is based upon the protection afforded by the armoured vehicle in which she was travelling at the time of the attack , and the accounts of her family and hospital staff who examined her . the limited x-ray material , the absence of a full post mortem examination and ct scan , have meant that the uk home office pathologist , dr nathaniel cary , who has been consulted in this case , is unable categorically to exclude the possibility of there being a gunshot wound to the upper trunk or neck . however when his findings are put alongside the accounts of those who had close contact with ms bhutto 's body , the available evidence suggests that there was no gunshot injury . importantly , dr cary excludes the possibility of a bullet to the neck or upper trunk as being a relevant factor in the actual cause of death , when set against the nature and extent of her head injury . in his report dr cary states : . •  the only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bomb-blast .  •  in my opinion mohtarma benazir bhutto died as a result of a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of the bomb-blast and due to head impact somewhere in the escape hatch of the vehicle .  given the severity of the injury to ms bhutto 's head , the prospect that she inadvertently hit her head whilst ducking down into the vehicle can be excluded as a reasonable possibility . high explosives of the type typically used in this sort of device , detonate at a velocity between 6000 and 9000 metres per second . this means that when considering the explosive quantities and distances involved , such an explosion would generate significantly more force than would be necessary to provoke the consequences as occurred in this case . it is also important to comment upon the construction of the vehicle . it was fitted with b6 grade armour and designed to withstand gunfire and bomb-blast . it is an unfortunate and misleading aspect of this case that the roof escape hatch has frequently been referred to as a sunroof . it is not . it is designed and intended to be used solely as a means of escape . it has a solid lip with a depth of 9cm . ms bhutto 's injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch . detailed analysis of the media footage provides supporting evidence . ms bhutto 's head did not completely disappear from view until 0.6 seconds before the blast . she can be seen moving forward and to the right as she ducked down into the vehicle . whilst her exact head position at the time of the detonation can never be ascertained , the overwhelming conclusion must be that she did not succeed in getting her head entirely below the lip of the escape hatch when the explosion occurred . how many people were involved in the immediate attack ? there has been speculation that two individuals were directly involved in the attack . the suggestion has been that one suspect fired shots , and a second detonated the bomb . all the available evidence points toward the person who fired shots and the person who detonated the explosives being one and the same person . • body parts from only one individual remain unidentified . expert opinion provides strong evidence that they originate from the suicide bomber . • analysis of the media footage places the gunman at the rear of the vehicle and looking down immediately before the explosion . the footage does not show the presence of any other potential bomber . • this footage when considered alongside the findings of the forensic explosive expert , that the bombing suspect was within 1 to 2 metres of the vehicle towards it rear and with no person or other obstruction between him and the vehicle , strongly suggests that the bomber and gunman were at the same position . it is virtually inconceivable that anyone who was where the gunman can clearly be seen on the media footage , could have survived the blast and escaped . the inevitable conclusion is that there was one attacker in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle in which ms bhutto was travelling . in essence , all the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shots before detonating an improvised explosive device . at the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of ms bhutto 's vehicle . the blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle , causing a severe and fatal head injury . john macbrayne qpm detective superintendent counter terrorism command 1st february 2008 e-mail to a friend .", "summary":
