{"text": "gasoline prices set a record for the 16th consecutive day wednesday . a gallon of gas cost an average of $ 3.62 , according to aaa , and much more in some markets . shell oil co. . president john hofmeister says a boost in u.s. production would startle the world market . all three presidential candidates have weighed in on the issue , and president bush on tuesday addressed it during a news conference . john hofmeister , president of shell oil co. , the u.s. division of royal dutch shell , addressed rising gasoline prices during an interview wednesday with john roberts on cnn 's  american morning .  roberts : what do you say to people who are in this budget crunch of trying to fill up the family car ? hofmeister : i say we need more gas to be produced in this country . i 've been saying that for three years , ever since i took this position -lsb- as president of shell -rsb- . if the u.s. set a goal to produce 2 to 3 million barrels more a day in this country , we would send a shock around the world that would immediately say to the speculators , hey , u.s. is serious . president -lsb- bush -rsb- said something yesterday about this . i did n't hear him , but i think that 's good news . but we should set a specific target . the presidential candidates should be out there on the postings saying let 's increase domestic production by 2 to 3 million barrels a day . that would be something that would put money back into this country , jobs back into this country , and it would bring more supply toward the americans who need it . roberts : the president is advocating more drilling on u.s. territory . is n't it true that globally we 're starting to reach a peak in production and that within maybe a decade or two oil production will begin to decrease ? hofmeister : well , i think there is some argument -lsb- that -rsb- with convenient , easy oil we will peak sometime in the next decade . i think shell sees that coming , but in terms of total oil supply to the world , we 're a long way from reaching peak oil because it does n't take into account unconventional oil . i think the president brings up a good point in that we could , we have the available domestic supplies off the coast of alaska as well as -lsb- the alaska national wildlife refuge -rsb- . shell has won $ 2 billion worth of high bids for the chukchi sea -- that 's a few years off before we could begin production . but let 's remember there 's more than 100 billion barrels of untouched oil and gas in this country that is subject to a 30-year moratorium . now , there 's only one body in this country that can set a 30-year moratorium , and that 's the u.s. government . roberts : sen. hillary clinton wants to slap you with a 50 percent tax on what she calls windfall profit , profit above a certain level . is that a good idea ? hofmeister : look at our revenues and our income for the last quarter . if we had made $ 7.8 million on $ 114 million of revenue , nobody would call that excessive , because that 's 7 1/2 percent . we made $ 7.8 billion profit on $ 114 billion revenue -- same 7 1/2 percent . so to me that is not an excessive number when banks and pharmaceuticals and it companies earn a whole lot more . watch hofmeister defend shell 's profits  roberts : would it hurt you if she put in place this tax on the windfall profits ? hofmeister : sure it would . it would slow down investment . taxing the oil companies was tried in the '80s . it drove us to do imports , which is exactly the problem we have today . roberts : where is the top of all this ? how high can the price of a barrel of oil go ? how high will the cost of a gallon of gasoline go ? hofmeister : i heard somebody say the other day it 's as long as a piece of string . we do n't know . roberts : the president of opec said $ 200 a barrel . hofmeister : yeah , well , there are some countries out there subsidizing the cost of their energy to their consumers and industries to compete with america -- or against america -- because they think america wo n't solve the problem . roberts : you 're saying you have no idea where the top is . hofmeister : we do n't know . but we should produce more oil in this country . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
