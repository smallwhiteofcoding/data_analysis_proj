{"text": "denver , colorado on a good day , keri christensen spends the day watching her children . she prepares their meals , gets them ready for school and helps them with their homework . keri christensen was nearly a victim of a roadside bombing in iraq when the convoy in front of hers was hit . but this housewife and mother of two is far different than most of the women living in her denver , colorado , suburb . she 's an iraqi war veteran , among the first women in the united states to be classified as combat veterans . even though she 's been home from the war for more than 2 1/2 years , she 's now fighting another battle -- this one with depression , nightmares , sleeplessness and anger . she says all of it is caused by her time in iraq .  i start feeling those feelings of ` i 'm not worthy . i ca n't raise my family , '  christensen said . women have made up about 11 percent of the military force in iraq and afghanistan in the past six years , according to the department of defense ; that 's an estimated 180,000 women in the war zone . the figure dwarfs the 41,000 women deployed during the persian gulf war and the 7,500 who served during the vietnam war , mostly as nurses . unlike past wars , women are assigned to combat support roles . many are seeing violence firsthand in an unconventional war . watch cnn 's randi kaye report on female veterans  as a member of the national guard , christensen transported tanks in iraq . she says she was shot at and was nearly a victim of a roadside bomb when a convoy in front of hers was hit .  you have this fear , ` oh , my god , i still have to go through there , '  she recalled .  ` am i going to make it ? '  christensen says that she was sexually harassed by a superior while serving in iraq and that the harassment added to the pressure created by just being in a war zone .  i just know it took a big toll on me because i was trying to deal with it myself . just trying to be a soldier ,  christensen said . in 2007 , the department of veterans affairs found that women are reporting signs of mental health issues when they return home at a higher rate than their male counterparts . the va diagnosed 60,000 veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder . of those , 22 percent of women suffered from  military sexual trauma ,  which includes sexual harassment or assault , compared with 1 percent of men . christensen , who has been diagnosed with ptsd , says she does n't like leaving her comfort zone . she does n't drive more than two miles from her home .  when i get outside my familiar safe territory , i start to feel overwhelmed ,  christensen said .  it gets foggy . not sure where i 'm really going . something comes over me where i do n't feel like i have control over it .   ptsd is actually something that shows up over time , and so the natural recovery process does n't happen ,  said dr. darrah westrup , who counsels female veterans at the va-run women 's health clinic in menlo park , california .  so three months out or so , you find yourself still not sleeping , still with nightmares , still having intrusive thoughts ,  westrup said . westrup says another factor contributing to poor mental health is the high amount of sexual trauma reported by women screened by the veterans administration . she says many women have trouble reporting the trauma to their superiors out of fear of retribution .  when you are in a war zone , your survival depends on people watching your back and on unit cohesion ,  westrup said .  the same individuals who attacked you are those who will be protecting you , or you 'll be fighting alongside the next day .  christensen receives counseling and group therapy sponsored by the va. . however , the military has said there is no merit to her claims that she suffered military sexual trauma . like many who suffer from post-traumatic stress , christensen still has her ups and downs . she says she 's just working to get past the feelings of guilt , shame , loss of control and low self-esteem .  i do n't think we 'll ever be the same . i think that you can learn to cope with it , and that 's what i 'm learning right now ,  she said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
