{"text": "chattanooga , tennessee when meeting jeff donohoo , it 's not immediately apparent he is a 36-year-old man living with autism . in fact , unless you get him talking about the atlanta braves -- one of his true passions in life -- he is a very quiet person . jeff donohoo , 36 , at work in the kitchen at memorial hospital in chattanooga , tennessee . early on , his younger brothers and sister did n't know , either .  since they grew up with him , they just knew jeff was jeff ,  said nancy donohoo , his mother .  they did n't think of him as weird or anything .  but when friends started to notice donohoo was different , nancy donohoo was quick to explain to a group of 10-year-olds why .  jeff has a social problem , not a mental problem ,  she explained .  he 's very smart . he reads encyclopedias ... he just does n't know how to talk to people .  from then on , friends who visited the house always made an effort to interact with donohoo , through a high-five or a simple  hello .  today , it 's unlikely donohoo will be the first to say hello in a group setting , but interacting with people is easier for him than it once was . see how donohoo copes every day  questioned about his childhood , his most elaborate response is  yeah  or  no .  but when the topic is the braves , it 's hard to get him to stop talking about the latest statistics or his favorite player , mark teixeira . asked how long he 's been a braves fan , there was little hesitation :  all my life .  he 's come a long way since he was a child . then , just teaching donohoo to talk was a challenge in itself , nancy donohoo said .  there was no eye contact , so i would hold his face in front of me , and say the word i wanted him to say .  donohoo entered the first grade as a special education student . it was the first year special education was offered in his family 's hometown of florence , alabama . he carried on with special education until the sixth grade , when he was mainstreamed , or put in classes with children without disabilities . explainer : understanding autism  for most of donohoo 's childhood , his mother had suspicions about his condition .  when he was little , i had watched a ` marcus welby ' show , and they had an autistic child on there . but he was very passive ; he sat in the corner and just hit things ,  nancy donohoo said .  jeff was wild . he was the opposite , so i just assumed he could n't be autistic . but he had a lot of those mannerisms .  it was donohoo 's freshman year of high school when nancy and bill donohoo learned what was wrong with their son .  there was a doctor in huntsville that dealt a lot with hyperactive children ,  nancy donohoo said .  he said , ` i 'm going to give you this sheet of paper ; these are all the symptoms of autism . '  the list had 19 symptoms , and nancy donohoo was instructed to circle the ones her son had . she circled 17 . the diagnosis did n't change how nancy donohoo dealt with her first-born son . in fact , the doctor said she already was doing all the right things , working to socialize donohoo . today , donohoo , living with his parents , finds comfort in strict routine . he wakes each day at 5 a.m. to make himself breakfast and prepare for work . at 6 , nancy donohoo drives her son to memorial hospital , where he 's entering his 16th year of service with the cafeteria . ollie forté is donohoo 's supervisor , and has worked with donohoo almost since the beginning .  he 's very valuable to us at this department . he 's dependable , on time , no attendance problems ,  said forté .  we love jeff .  after work , at 2:30 p.m. , donohoo rides with his mother to the ymca , where he works out for about three hours . then it 's back home , where he fixes himself dinner and spends hours online looking up braves statistics , or reading a number of baseball-related books from his personal library . this cycle repeats on days donohoo works at the hospital . on his days off , the schedule is equally strict , with little variation . he 'll still go to the ymca , and he 'll also make the occasional trip to the bookstore , adding to his collection of baseball-related literature . sudden changes to daily plans are still a challenge .  if he 's made his plans to do something tonight ,  said bill donohoo ,  and we come and say , ` we 're going to get something to eat . do you want to go ? ' that upsets his plans for what he 's going to do that night .  physical contact is also difficult .  he does n't like to be touched ,  nancy donohoo said .  he does n't freak , but he does n't like it . he stiffens up . he 'll want to give you a hug , but he still has a hard time .  the many challenges aside , donohoo has a fine appreciation for things like cooking . in addition to preparing his own meals , he also enjoys baking .  he loves desserts -- he loves sweets ,  nancy donohoo said with a laugh .  he 's a little heavy , but we 're working on that .  nancy and bill donohoo have endured the challenges , and they acknowledge their son will never be fully independent . but one can tell they could n't be prouder of him .  it 's rewarding today , because he 's come so far , but it was a long road ,  nancy donohoo said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
