{"text": "washington the nation 's largest publicly owned utility company may be vulnerable to cyber attacks , according to a new report . in 2007 president bush visited the browns ferry nuclear plant , operated by the tennessee valley authority . the tennessee valley authority , which supplies power to almost 9 million americans ,  has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures ,  leaving them  vulnerable to disruption ,  the government accountability office found . simply put , that means a skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout . rep. james langevin , a rhode island democrat , fears the problem is much larger than just the tva .  if they are not secure , i do n't have a great deal of confidence that the rest of our critical infrastructure on the electric grid is secure ,  he said . the tva operates 52 nuclear , hydroelectric and fossil-fuel facilities in the southeastern united states . among the government watchdog agency findings : . • the tva 's firewalls have been bypassed or are inadequately configured . • passwords are not effective . • servers and work stations lack key patches and effective virus protection . • intrusion-detection systems are not adequate . • some locations lack enough physical security around control systems . the gao recommends 73 steps to correct the problems in its report to congress . in september , cnn first aired dramatic footage of a government experiment demonstrating that a cyber attack could destroy electrical equipment . the experiment , dubbed  aurora ,  caused a generator to fall apart and grind to a halt after a computer attack on its control system . the test was conducted by scientists at the idaho national laboratory . in october , the north american electric reliability corp. told congress that 75 percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the aurora vulnerability , but langevin said it now appears that congress was misled . a congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation 's claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to fix the problem .  it appears that they just made those numbers up ,  langevin said .  it is not acceptable . it is outrageous .  he said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks . the electric reliability corporation -- a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers -- told cnn it regrets the confusion . experts told cnn that cooper industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the aurora vulnerability . the company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide . it has sold just over 100 , it told cnn . langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps , and he will press to give those powers to the federal energy regulatory commission . the congressman is chairing an emerging threats , cybersecurity , and science and technology subcommittee hearing wednesday afternoon . representatives of the tva , the gao , the federal commission and the electric reliability corporation are to appear before the subcommittee .", "summary": "no summary"}
