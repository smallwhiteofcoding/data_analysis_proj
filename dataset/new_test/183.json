{"text": "los angeles , california former detainees of immigration and customs enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation . raymond soeoth , pictured here with his wife , says he was injected with drugs by ice agents against his will . one of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug haldol , which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses . doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered . two immigrants , raymond soeoth of indonesia and amadou diouf of senegal in west africa , told cnn they were injected with the drugs against their will . both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the american civil liberties union against the government . they are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages . watch why the former detainees claim abuse  dr. paul appelbaum , a professor of psychiatry , law and ethics at columbia university , reviewed both men 's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered .  i 'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way ,  said appelbaum , who also serves as a member of the american academy of psychiatry and the law .  that is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world .  the allegations of ice forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by sen. joe lieberman , i-connecticut , during the re-nomination hearing of ice chief julie myers .  the information the committee has received from ice regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ice may have violated its own detention standards ,  lieberman spokeswoman leslie phillips told cnn in an e-mail .  senator lieberman intends to follow up with ice to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so .  aclu attorney ahilan arulanantham , who is representing soeoth and diouf , said ,  it would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who is n't even mentally ill . ... but here , it 's happening on u.s. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport .  responding to lieberman 's written questions , myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had  medical escorts  for deportation since 2003 . from october last year to the end of april this year , she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process . of those , 33 detainees received medication  because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self ,  she said .  first , i am aware of , and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ice detention standards ,  myers said . she added no detainee should be  involuntarily medicated without court order ,  except in emergency situations . but both soeoth and diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior . soeoth , a christian minister from indonesia , spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected . hours before he was to be sent back home on december 7 , 2004 , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days . see the document that shows soeoth was injected .  they pushed me on the bench , they opened my pants , and they just give me injection ,  he said through broken english . he says he was taken to los angeles international airport while in this drug-induced stupor , but two hours before takeoff , airline security refused to transport him , so ice agents returned him to his cell at terminal island near los angeles . terminal island , once a federal prison , is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation . soeoth 's medical records indicate he was injected with cogentin and haldol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness . in the records , the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark soeoth denies ever making . ice said in a written statement it could n't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation .  department of homeland security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees ,  the ice statement said .  only trained and qualified medical professionals , including officers of the u.s. public health service , may prescribe or administer medication .  but , diouf says , he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported . he said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his u.s. government escorts would n't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country . see diouf 's stay of deportation document . that 's when , he says ,  i was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes .  a government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders . in both cases , diouf and soeoth remain in the united states pending a decision in the case . if they lose , they may land back in the hands of ice , once again facing deportation . soeoth says he 's traumatized by what happened .  i know this country -lsb- is -rsb- very generous to immigrants ,  he says .  what they did to me was very , very bad .
