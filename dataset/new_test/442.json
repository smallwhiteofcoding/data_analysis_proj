{"text": "unless you 're a perfect caretaker of your lawn -lrb- and , really , who is ? -rrb- , prepare for another round in the turf wars this summer . you 'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions , of course . and an attack from the crabgrass . but you 'll face more stealthy opponents , too : root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown .  if a lawn is neglected , or cared for in a hit-or-miss way , it gets weak ,  says this old house landscape contractor roger cook .  and that 's when weeds , insects , or fungal diseases become a major problem .  little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders . but as in most battles , the best defense is a strong offense : doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf . that means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week ; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots ; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height -lrb- ask your local garden center what 's best where you live -rrb- ; and fertilizing in spring and fall . so promise yourself -- and your turf -- you 'll do that this year . in the meantime , here 's how to conquer the most common turf problems you 're likely to confront this summer . fungal disease . symptoms : circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass ; or blades with tiny red threads . culprits : powdery mildew , brown patch , dollar spot , and fusarium patch ; or red thread . these fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf . solutions : though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection , if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard , look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions . for an organic fix , search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi . then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits : avoid excessive shade -lrb- prune back trees and large shrubs , if necessary -rrb- and too many applications of fertilizer , herbicides , or pesticides . carefully monitor your turf 's moisture intake and never water in the evening . weeds . symptoms : fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass . this old house : what type of grass is right for your yard . culprits : crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion , purslane , henbit , and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass has n't completely taken root . to check for compacted soil , stick a screwdriver into the ground ; it should slide in easily . solutions : the first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders . the best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe . this will also loosen the soil in affected areas . or use a liquid herbicide in a hand sprayer to spot-treat an infestation . if weeds are too plentiful to be pulled , check your garden center for a  weed-and-feed  blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area , or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten . be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly , as some formulas must be applied during a dry spell or need a 24-hour breather with no foot traffic . from here on out , mow up to twice a week during the beginning of summer when grass grows swiftly , and raise the mower blade an inch during hot or dry periods . water well as the summer heats up , and your turf should naturally overtake the weeds . in the fall , open up compacted soil poke holes with a pitchfork over a small yard , or rent a power aerator for large yards and overseed the lawn . you may want to follow up with a pre-emergent herbicide next spring . insects . symptoms : brown turf that becomes loose enough to lift like a mat . culprits : white grubs , a catch-all name for root-chomping beetle larvae , including june bugs , japanese beetles , and masked chafers . to be sure that 's what you 've got , cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back , looking for pale , half-inch - to inch-long c-shaped bugs . if you find more than six , treat the turf . this old house : meet the good bugs . solutions : grubs are the biggest threat to lawns , and pesticides formulated with imidacloprid are proven effective . for an organic fix , spread powdered milky spore or lay down beneficial nematodes-microscopic worms that will feed on the grubs if they 're present . with nematodes , timing the application with their life cycle is critical , so be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly . both milky spore and nematodes can be ordered from some garden centers or online -lrb- gardensalive.com -rrb- . symptoms : irregular-shaped patches of brownish-yellow grass . culprits : chinch bugs , gray-black , quarter-inch-long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack st. augustine and zoysia grasses in the south and kentucky bluegrass in the north . to spot them , bury an empty coffee can , with both ends removed , at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water . the bugs will seek out the moisture , then float to the top . if you see more than 10 after 20 minutes , you should address the problem . solutions : chinch bugs live on the surface , among thatch , so dethatching will reduce their numbers . to eradicate them completely , look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient . longer-term , overseed with chinch-bug-resistant grasses . symptoms : patches of thin lawn with blades chewed off at the base . culprits : sod webworms and tropical sod webworms , hairless cream-to-gray spotted caterpillars that grow into small , buff-colored moths at maturity . the tropical species that thrive in warm southern climates cause the most harm . to check for webworms , mix two tablespoons of mild detergent with two gallons of water ; pour it over the infested turf . any larvae will float to the top . solutions : you can try flooding your lawn to drown them . or choose an appropriate insecticide ; in an organic product , look for the ingredients azadirachtin or spinosad . with extreme cases of tropical webworm infestation you may need to replace the turf with a resistant grass mix . tip : if dogs regularly make a pit stop of your lawn , keep a hose or water bucket nearthe best fix is immediate action : flush the area asap with water to dilute it . once badly burned , grass wo n't come back on its own-you 'll have to rake out the dead stuff and reseed . this old house : what to do when your yard is bowser 's bathroom e-mail to a friend . get 2 free trial issues . copyright Â© 2008 this old house ventures , inc. .", "summary": "no summary"}
