{"text": "washington sen. barack obama on thursday criticized a recent vote by democratic presidential rival sen. hillary clinton as helping to give president bush a  blank check  to take military action against iran . sen. barack obama says sen. hillary clinton has shown  flawed  judgment .  we know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what congress says ,  obama said in an interview with cnn 's wolf blitzer . last month , clinton voted to support a resolution declaring iran 's islamic revolutionary guard corps , an elite part of the iranian military , a foreign terrorist group . -lrb- the nonbinding amendment to the defense authorization act passed by a 76-22 vote . -rrb- . obama said he would have voted against the measure but did n't because he was campaigning in new hampshire at the time . he said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the senate .  this is a problem  related to running for president , he said . obama said clinton also had shown  flawed  judgment during the vote to authorize the iraq war five years ago .  we know that there was embodied in this legislation , or this resolution sent to the senate , language that would say our iraqi troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with iran ,  obama said .  now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it , we do n't want to repeat that mistake .  clinton on thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on new hampshire public radio , saying  what i voted on was a nonbinding resolution . it 's not an amendment . it 's not a law .  while clinton was campaigning sunday in new hampton , iowa , an audience member at a town hall-style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the iran measure and asked why she had n't learned from past  mistakes .  calling  the premise of the question  wrong , the senator from new york argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed . the sanctions , clinton said , will in turn  send a clear message to the leadership  and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts . earlier this month , clinton also co-sponsored legislation with sen. jim webb , d-virginia , that would prohibit military operations against iran without congressional approval . obama 's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77-23 senate vote that authorized the president to use force against iraq . obama , then an illinois state senator , spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time . clinton 's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them , obama said . watch as obama questions clinton 's judgment   i do n't think it disqualified her , but i think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment ,  obama said .  it speaks to how we will make decisions going forward .  i think her judgment was flawed on this issue .  obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with clinton , whom many political observers view as the front-runner for the democratic nomination .  there 's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign ,  obama said .  the first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where i 've been and what i am about .  in this next phase , we want to make sure that voters understand that on big issues , like the decision to go into the war in iraq , i had real differences with the other candidates , and that reflects on my judgment .  another leading democratic candidate , john edwards , also voted in 2002 to authorize force in iraq while he was then a senator from north carolina . he later called his vote a mistake . in a veiled swipe at clinton , obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer  something new , as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we 've become so accustomed to , that frankly the american people are sick of .  obama would not say whether he would consider clinton as his running mate should he become the democratic party 's nominee .  i think sen. clinton is a very capable person ,  he said .  right now , my goal is to make sure i am the nominee , and she is still the senator from new york .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's scott anderson and alexander mooney contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
