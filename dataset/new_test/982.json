{"text": "middlesbrough , england -- middlesbrough have confirmed that midfielders fabio rochemback and gaizka mendieta and striker dong gook lee have all been released . middlesbrough have decided against taking up the option of re-signing brazilian midfielder fabio rochemback . the premier league club had an option to extend brazilian rochemback 's deal by another two years , but manager gareth southgate has decided to let him go .  we both feel that the time is right for fabio to have a fresh challenge ,  southgate said .  he is a talented footballer and i think he 's just had his best season for us , while it was fitting that he should bow out against manchester city on sunday with probably his best performance in a middlesbrough shirt .  the 26-year-old joined boro from barcelona in 2005 and played 91 games for the teesside club . he signed off in style by scoring a thumping long-range free-kick in sunday 's 8-1 victory over city . rochemback , who netted seven times for boro , played a major role in helping the club reach the 2006 uefa cup final , a year after appearing in the final during a loan spell with sporting lisbon -- where he is expected to move back to this summer . mendieta , 34 , was one of football 's costliest players when he joined lazio from valencia for 48 million euros in 2001 , but he disappointed and joined barcelona and then boro on loan . the former spain midfielder joined permanently on a free transfer in 2004 , but has not played for the first team since december 26 , 2006 .  it was a difficult situation for a player of gaizka 's caliber to find himself out of the first team reckoning ,  added southgate .  i made it clear to him that he did not figure in my plans but he decided to stay and try to get back into the first team .  that did n't work out but his attitude to training was always excellent and he was a good influence on some of our young reserve team players .  south korean international lee joined boro on a free transfer from pohang steelers in january 2007 . he scored only twice in 11 starts and 18 appearances as a substitute and has not appeared for the first team since early february . southgate is still hopeful of persuading goalkeeper mark schwarzer to sign a new contract at the riverside . the 35-year-old australian joined boro from bradford city in a $ 3 million deal in february 1997 and has played nearly 450 games for the club . his deal runs out this summer and he has so far refused to sign an extension , prompting reports of interest from a host of european clubs .  we are talking to mark . i 'd like him to stay . his experience is important but he has real drive and determination that is still increasing ,  said southgate .  he is the one in our dressing room that can truly say he has played at the highest level -- in world cups , in europe , in cup finals and so on .  we have to negotiate and see where we go , but players have to want to stay here and we have to want to keep them .  mark has been here a long time so he has to decide if he needs a fresh challenge , whether what we are trying to do is going to excite him , whether he feels he is going to be appreciated here .  southgate also confirmed they have offered striker tom craddock and right-back tony mcmahon one-year extensions to their current deals , which run out this summer . brazilian rivaldo has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for greek club aek again next season . the 36-year-old had decided to quit after aek were denied the title because olympiakos were awarded three points for a game they lost after the opposing team fielded an ineligible player .  the truth is that at the end of the championship , i felt great disappointment and a -lrb- sense of -rrb- injustice , but the love and support i have received from fans and the team have contributed to my final decision ... i have decided to stay at aek next season ,  rivaldo said in a statement on the club 's web site . olympiakos lost 1-0 on february 3 , but greek sports authorities gave them the points because apollon played roman wallner who had turned out for two other clubs during the season . apollon 's appeal to the court of arbitration for sport was rejected on april 21 . olympiakos finished the season with 70 points , two ahead of aek , for their 11th title in 12 years . rivaldo , who has played at ac milan and barcelona and starred in brazil 's 2002 world cup victory , spent three seasons at olympiakos from 2004 . he moved to aek last year after a contract dispute . tottenham midfielder jamie o'hara has signed a new three-year contract with the club . the 21-year-old made his debut this season and went on to score two goals in a total 25 appearances .  he has come a long way in a short space of time so i congratulate him and this new contract is recognition of his efforts ,  said manager juande ramos .  jamie is an example to all the young players at the club in that reaching the first team can be achieved through hard work and giving the best of yourself .  however , tottenham goalkeeper radek cerny has left the club . the 34-year-old czech international , who was on loan from sparta prague , has joined ambitious championship club queens park rangers on a two-year contract .", "summary": "no summary"}
