{"text": "canada announced wednesday that it will dispatch a warship to somalia 's coast to protect u.n. aid ships from pirate attacks . the canadian frigate hmcs ville de quebec will escort ships carrying food aid to somalia .  canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking ville de quebec with the role of escorting world food programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports ,  canadian defense minister peter mackay said in a government news release . the united nations hunger program praised canada for answering its call for help , and said it hoped other governments would step forward to take over from canada once it completes its mission in a few weeks . the hmcs ville de quebec is a 440-foot frigate armed with torpedoes , surface-to-air missiles and other weapons , and carries a twin-engine sea king anti-submarine helicopter . ville de quebec , which can travel at speeds greater than 27 knots , will be dispatched after somalia 's transitional government formally authorizes the mission , the government 's news release said . wfp asked the world 's naval powers in mid-june to help its ships reach the more than 2 million people in need of aid . it put out the request weeks before french , danish and dutch warships ended their escort missions , which began in november . pirate attacks on unescorted ships have been a growing problem in somalia . three european freighters were hijacked off the horn of africa in june , adding to the 27 other reported attacks this year , according to the international maritime bureau , which tracks piracy . wfp delivers 80 percent of its aid to somalia by sea , and wfp spokesman peter smerdon said that if there are no warships to escort the food supply , the program will have to rely on ground or air travel to deliver the food . but both are dangerous and expensive . the agency said that if there is no assistance from naval powers , piracy will increase , and so will death and malnutrition . smerdon said that although somalia 's food crisis has n't yet reached the devastation of the early 1990s ,  we 're worried it will be .
