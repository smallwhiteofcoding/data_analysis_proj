{"text": "glasgow , scotland -- jean-claude darcheville and nacho novo both scored twice to fire leaders rangers to a 4-0 win at hearts , their 10th consecutive scottish premier league victory . jean-claude darcheville scored two first-half goals as rangers cruised to a 4-0 victory at hearts . hearts found themselves ripped apart by a rampant rangers side , who sent out a clear message to rivals celtic by maintaining their four-point advantage at the summit . darcheville claimed the opener after 25 minutes , cutting inside from the left and squeezing his shot inside the far post from a tight angle . the same player added a second two minutes before the break , scoring from close range after a barry ferguson corner was not cleared . darcheville was withdrawn for novo at the interval , but if hearts thought the departure of the frenchman meant some much-needed respite , they were sadly mistaken . novo was on the pitch for seven minutes when he helped himself to a goal of his own . charlie adam set up the shot with a low ball across goal and all that was required from the striker was to bundle home from close range . the same two players combined again to supply rangers with their fourth goal with 69 minutes gone . adam was again the provider and this time novo produced a cheeky back-heel finish from five meters . meanwhile , goals by scott mcdonald and georgios samaras gave celtic a hard-fought 2-1 win at home to inverness caledonian thistle . australian international mcdonald 's 25th goal of the season right on the interval gave the champions the lead and his greek team-mate bulleted an aiden mcgeady cross past goalkeeper michael fraser on the hour mark . but the final minutes were needlessly fraught for celtic after caley striker marius niculae took advantage of scott brown 's misplaced pass to pull a goal back in the 70th minute . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
