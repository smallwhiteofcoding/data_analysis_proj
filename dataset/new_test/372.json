{"text": "scientists have discovered the remains of a rodent the size of a small car which used to forage the south american continent . the 1-ton creature is believed to have been about 3 meters in length and 1.5 meters tall . the fossilized skull of the new giant rodent . the giant rat 's skull , which measures an impressive 53 centimeters in diameter was found by andr√©s rinderknecht and ernesto blanco , two scientists from montevideo , uruguay . the two paleontologists stumbled upon the fossilized remains in a broken boulder in san jose along the coast of uruguay . by looking at the size ratios of the skulls and bodies of existing rodents , scientists determined the bodyweight of the rodent must have approached 1,000 kilograms or a ton , making it the world 's largest rodent to have been discovered to date . the relatively small size of its teeth however , suggests it fed mainly upon soft vegetables and fruit .  we can give an educated guess that the rodent would have been 3 meters long -- assuming that it was similar to a capybara -lrb- the largest rodent alive today -rrb- and taking it into account that large mammals generally have relatively smaller heads . it 's tail probably was closer to the one of capybara or guinea pig -lrb- very short -rrb- and not like a rat ,  ernesto blanco says . the scientists believe the rodent , named josephoartigasia monesi , roamed the earth about four million years ago at the same time as other giant creatures , such as terror birds , saber-toothed cats , ground sloths and giant armored mammals . during this period , the now arid region was forested and rich in vegetation . the largest living rodent is the capybara , a 50 kilogram guinea pig found in south america . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
