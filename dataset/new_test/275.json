{"text": "london , england princess diana 's relationships with two muslim men provoked an outburst from her mother , who called her daughter  a whore  , paul burrell , the princess 's former butler , told an inquest monday . diana once referred to her former butler paul burrell as  my rock .  burrell , who returned to britain from his home in florida to give evidence , was the first star witness of the london inquest , now in its fourth month . his role as confidant to diana , who died in a paris car crash on august 31 , 1997 , along with her boyfriend dodi fayed and hotel security chief henri paul , meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated . burrell , whom the late princess once called  my rock ,  cast doubt on whether diana was ready to marry fayed . according to burrell , the princess was still  holding a candle  for former boyfriend and heart surgeon hasnat khan -- who she called  her soulmate  -- when she started dating fayed  on the rebound .  burrell told the inquest that diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in june 1997 with her mother , frances shand kydd , who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with muslim men .  she called the princess a ` whore ' and she said that she was messing around with ` effing muslim men ' and she was ` disgraceful ' and said some very nasty things ,  burrell said . he agreed that , as a result of such calls diana , decided not to talk to her mother again . the inquest , which began in october and is expected to last another two or three months , aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the princess and dodi and determine their cause of death -- whether by accident or otherwise . asked earlier in the day if he believed that fayed was  the one ,  burrell said  no , i did not have that impression .  he also cast doubt on claims that fayed and diana were engaged or on the cusp of engagement , saying :  i find that difficult to believe .  asked to explain himself , burrell said :  because this was only a 30-day relationship and the princess had just finished a long-term relationship with someone -lrb- khan -rrb- she cared deeply about . i knew that because i was there and i saw it .  diana 's 18-month relationship with khan ended around the same time she started seeing fayed in july 1997 . burrell said diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with khan might take place , given that khan is muslim . watch report on claims about diana 's marriage plans .  khan had not proposed to the princess , burrell said , adding that khan was  the man she loved more than any other .  he said he spoke to diana about the possibility that fayed would give her a ring shortly before her death . burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand , rather than the left , as is customary with engagement rings .  i need marriage like a bad rash ,  burrell claimed diana told him . last month at the inquest lady annabel goldsmith , a friend of diana , said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage  like a rash on my face .  burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring , as the fayed family has maintained . fayed family spokesman michael cole testified last week that dodi 's father , mohamed al fayed , was certain the couple had planned to marry . lawyers at the inquest asked burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the monday following the fatal car crash . there has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news , such as an engagement . but burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan . he said he had actually looked at diana 's schedule for that day and found only mundane items , and nothing to indicate she planned a special announcement . burrell also told the inquest he did not believe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's , husband was involved in diana 's death . mohamed al fayed , father of dodi and the owner of harrods department store , has long claimed that senior members of the royal family -- specifically the queen 's husband , prince philip -- ordered the pair be murdered . he also claims that diana was pregnant at the time of her death . but burrell said that he knew prince philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths .  i can tell you that is not prince philip 's nature ,  he said .  plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren . why would he want to harm her ? it 's not possible .  the inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which prince philip sent to diana , with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters . but other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed ,  pa.  burrell explained that philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks .  prince philip does n't mix his words ,  burrell said .  he says it as it is , but he is not a nasty man . prince philip is n't known for his diplomacy . he was fond of the princess .  burrell worked for the british royals for 21 years and became close to diana after her separation from prince charles . he has written two books about his time with the princess . in his second book , burrell told of a letter from diana which indicated she feared for her life . the princess wrote that prince charles planned  ` an accident ' in my car , brake failure and serious head injury .  one of diana 's close friends , however , testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged . lucia flecha de lima said on december 18 that burrell was capable of imitating the princess 's handwriting . lawyers questioned burrell about the date of the letter . burrell said it was written in october 1996 , two months , after diana and charles divorced -- yet the letter refers to charles as  my husband .  burrell responded that diana always referred to charles that way , even after the divorce . the inquest has revealed that diana was a prolific letter-writer who also received a lot of correspondence . witnesses , including burrell , recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk , with the more important ones stored in a special box . burrell testified that after diana 's death , her mother , frances shand-kidd , worked every day for a week shredding the papers from diana 's desk . he said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on december 19 , 1997 . it was at this meeting that queen elizabeth told burrell :  there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge .  that comment , which has been widely reported , was meant to warn him to be careful , burrell said , and was not a warning about any one person or group of people . at the same meeting burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of diana 's belongings to keep safe . the details of the conversation emerged when burrell stood trial for their alleged theft in 2002 , causing the case against him to collapse . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's emily chang and heidi berger contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
