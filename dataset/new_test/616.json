{"text": "london , england -- a colombian sculptor has created a mystery at london 's tate modern gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor .  shibboleth  is colombian artist doris salcedo 's first public commission in the united kingdom . the work by doris salcedo begins as a hairline crack then widens and deepens as it snakes across the full 167 meters -lrb- 548 feet -rrb- of the former power station 's turbine hall . salcedo said  shibboleth ,  a statement about racism , took her more than a year to make but has revealed little else about its construction . she apparently created it elsewhere and spent the past five weeks installing it in the tate , on the south bank of the river thames . she refused to say how she managed seemingly to crack open a concrete floor .  what is important is the meaning of the piece . the making of it is not important ,  she said . asked how deep the crack goes , she replied :  it 's bottomless . it 's as deep as humanity .  visitors meanwhile are warned not to trip on the crack . tate director nicholas serota insisted the work was no optical illusion .  this sculpture has been made in the most painstaking , meticulous way by doris and her team before it was slowly inserted into the turbine hall ,  he told the press association .  it has taken five weeks of work here with very considerable disruption to the hall . it 's not an illusion - it 's there , it 's real .  from the tate 's point of view , there were only two questions : could we realize it in the way doris envisaged ? and once the piece was created , would it damage the structural integrity of the building forever ?  the answer to the first was yes , and to the second was no .  he declined to elaborate further . the installation will be removed next april by filling in the crack . serota said :  there is a crack , there is a line , and eventually there will be a scar and that scar will remain . it will remain as a memory of the work and also as a memorial to the issues doris touches on .  the artist said the work of art represents the gap between white europeans and the rest of humanity . wire mesh is on show because it is  the most common means of control used to define borders and divisions .  salcedo said of the work :  it represents borders , the experience of immigrants , the experience of segregation , the experience of racial hatred .  it is the experience of a third world person coming into the heart of europe .  for example , the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space . and so this piece is a negative space .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
