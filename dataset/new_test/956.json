{"text": "the crib in ellen darcy 's boston home has sat empty for more than a year . and in suburban washington , laura teresinski has prepared a nursery for a baby that may never arrive . guatemala has announced it will conduct a case-by-case review of every pending foreign adoption case . they and thousands of prospective parents , eager to adopt children from abroad , have found themselves in an emotional legal limbo since two of the most popular countries for international adoptions -- guatemala and vietnam -- recently halted their programs . now would-be mothers and fathers around the united states wonder what will become of their quest to adopt a child -- a pursuit that can fray nerves , cost up to $ 30,000 and span several years . guatemala announced this month that it would conduct a case-by-case review of every pending foreign adoption case . that put on hold the adoption plans of about 2,000 american families . the crackdown comes amid reports that some in guatemala coerce mothers to relinquish their children for adoption -- or steal the children outright and present them as orphans . similar accusations have arisen in vietnam . after the united states accused adoption agencies there of corruption and baby-selling , vietnam said in april that it would no longer allow adoptions to the united states .  my husband and i were absolutely devastated ,  teresinski said .  adoptive parents have put a lot of emotional energy and a lot of financial resources in the process .  vietnam 's decision affects several hundred families . families in the united states adopted 4,728 children from guatemala and 828 from vietnam last year . the halt in adoptions from those two nations unfolds against the backdrop of a dramatic rise in international adoptions in the united states . the number of foreign-born children adopted by u.s. families more than tripled from 1990 to 2004 , when it reached a high of 22,884 , though the figure has declined slightly each year since . in 2007 , the u.s. granted visas to 19,613 children so they could join an adoptive family in the united states , according to u.s. state department figures . about 70 percent of those children came from four countries : china , guatemala , russia and ethiopia . a few other countries have also halted foreign adoptions at various times , including kazakhstan and togo . yet the suspensions in vietnam and guatemala have had the biggest impact -- they 're two of the 10 countries that send the most children to adoptive homes in the unites states . fear of fraud stirs heartache . for darcy , the review seems more detrimental than helpful . her adopted daughter , carolina , remains in a guatemalan foster home with three dozen other babies . darcy worries that keeping carolina , now 15 months old , in a foster home will harm her early development .  she 's not getting one-on-one care by a consistent caretaker ,  darcy said , adding later ,  nobody is looking at this as a violation of the kids ' human rights except for these -lrb- american -rrb- parents .  guatemala , which until now has had little to no oversight of its foreign adoptions , has the highest per capita rate of adoption in the world . nearly one in 100 babies born in guatemala wind up living with adoptive parents in the united states , according to the u.s. consulate in guatemala . while adoptive parents in the united states undergo rigorous screening , adoptions in guatemala had been processed by notaries responsible for determining whether the babies were relinquished voluntarily . they also arrange foster care and handle paperwork -- notaries in latin america tend to have more legal training than notaries in the united states . both guatemalan and u.s. officials fear the system leads to practices such as paying birth mothers for children or , in some instances , coercion . officials in both countries say gaps in regulations and the high sums of money at play -- adoptions can cost up to $ 30,000 -- may have created unintended incentives in a country where the state department estimates that 80 percent of the population lives in poverty . the guatemalan government has said its review could take a month or longer . as for the american families , they can only wait .  i think it 's overkill ,  said darcy , who was matched with carolina last march and was approved to adopt the girl last winter -- typically one of the last steps before the actual adoption is complete .  no adoptive parent wants to adopt an abducted child -- a child that was n't voluntarily relinquished -- but to keep them as hostages is unacceptable ,  darcy said . guatemala plans reforms . u.s. officials say they sympathize with the parents , but that reviews like the one in guatemala are in the best interest of the children .  we feel for them , it 's a tough situation ,  said a state department official who is not authorized to speak on the record .  -lrb- but -rrb- they 'll have the comfort of knowing american parents in the future who adopt from guatemala will get children from a system that has all the safeguards in place so that children are not exploited ,  the official said . in the past , guatemala required birth mothers to sign a document in court saying they were relinquishing their child . they were not required to reveal their reasons . now the government may require the presence of the birth mother and child . the goal is to verify identification and make sure the mother is giving up her child voluntarily . cleaning up guatemala 's adoption system is a step toward complying with the standards of the hague convention on intercountry adoption , an international agreement that governs adoptions from one country to another . about 70 nations have signed the convention , which seeks to ensure legitimate foreign adoptions . the united states joined the international convention last year , and rules governing adoptions from one signatory nation to another took effect april 1 . the united states has stopped issuing visas to guatemalan children after that date , blocking their travel to america -- at least until concerns are addressed .  we 're not pointing fingers at american parents ,  the state department official said . however , the review and changes in guatemala will ensure that it  does not become a fertile ground for -lrb- wrongful -rrb- practices on any person , particularly children , who have not been orphaned .  to offset corruption , the u.s. embassy has added its own requirement : that birth mothers appear with the baby to request a visa for the bastill , the guatemalan solicitor general 's office has identified at least 80 cases of adoption irregularities , including baby stealing and false dna tests . and the guatemalan chief prosecutor 's office recently launched a criminal investigation into the two laboratories contracted to take dna samples from birth mothers and children . ` serious irregularities ' in vietnam . similar concerns of corruption recently emerged in vietnam , where investigators had found  serious adoption irregularities ,  according to a report by the u.s. embassy in hanoi . documents had been forged or altered , the embassy said , and some parents were paid , tricked or forced into giving up their children for adoption . in some cases , the embassy said , children were offered for adoption without the knowledge or permission of their parents . the vietnamese government has denied the accusations . even so , it said in april that it would terminate its adoption agreement with the united states , saying it wo n't accept applications after july 1 . the program is scheduled to end september 1 . parents in the united states who were matched with an adoptive child in vietnam before july 1 will be allowed to adopt that child . prospective parents who had invested time and money , but had not been matched with an adoptive child , appear to be out of luck . private adoption agencies insist that nearly all adoptions from vietnam are problem-free , and they want the adoptions to continue .  it 's hard to let go , because we know we can advocate for these children and make a real difference ,  said linda brownlee , executive director of the nonprofit adoption center of washington , which places children for adoption from russia , china , cambodia and vietnam . she hopes the united states and vietnam reach an agreement so that adoptions can continue .  without it , i think children are going to be harmed . they are going to die needlessly , and there is going to be trafficking ,  brownlee said .", "summary": "no summary"}
