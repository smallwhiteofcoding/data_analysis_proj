{"text": "georgian leaders may be blaming russia for the conflict raging in south ossetia , but former soviet president mikhail gorbachev said thursday  there is no doubt  that georgia provoked the clash . mikhail gorbachev told cnn 's larry king that russia called extra troops into georgia to stem violence . gorbachev told cnn 's larry king that russia moved additional forces into south ossetia in response to  devastation  in the south ossetia city of tskhinvali .  this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town , against a sleeping people . this was a barbaric assault ,  said gorbachev , the last president of the former soviet union . but georgian president mikheil saakashvili , who also appeared on cnn 's  larry king live  thursday , said he was  profoundly shocked  that mikhail gorbachev would use a television appearance  for basically vindicating lies and deceptions .  last week , georgia said it launched an operation into south ossetia after a cease-fire was broken with artillery fire from russian separatists that killed 10 people including civilians and peacekeepers . it accused russia , which also has peacekeepers in the region , of backing the separatists . hours later , the russian news agency interfax reported that russian authorities said 10 russian peacekeepers had been killed and 30 wounded in an attack by georgians .  western television did n't show what happened in tskhinvali ,  gorbachev said .  only now they 're beginning to show some pictures of the destruction . so this looks to me like it was a well-prepared project . and with any outcome , they wanted to put the blame on russia .  watch gorbachev discuss  barbaric assault   he called georgia 's claims that russia is attempting to dismantle its democracy  all lies from beginning to end .  in response , saakashvili expressed disappointment with the sentiments from gorbachev , who he said he once respected .  this is the man , mr. gorbachev , who helped to , you know , bring down kgb kingdom . and he is the one who is , you know , justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country ,  saakashvili said .  shame on him . shame on you , mr. gorbachev , for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union .  gorbachev also said the united states is jeopardizing its fragile relationship with russia by backing georgia . watch gorbachev discuss u.s.-russia relations   there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u.s. and russia interests , and the interests of other countries , and the interests of stability , particularly in the hotspots in different continents ,  said gorbachev , who won the nobel peace price in 1990 .", "summary": "no summary"}
