{"text": "1 . bobby murcer 's biggest fan . former new york yankee bobby murcer warms up during old timers day yankee stadium on july 7 . our first story has a fairy-tale middle and a horrible ending . in august of ' 77 , bobby murcer of the cubs promised to hit a home run for terminally ill fan scott crull . that night , murcer hit two of them . pretty amazing , especially when you consider murcer only hit nine homers the whole next season . but that 's not why crull -- a 12-year-old from calumet city , illinois -- makes this list . broadcasting the game nationally on abc , keith jackson told the country how murcer had fulfilled the dying boy 's last wish . eyes watered , spines tingled . there was only one problem -- nobody had ever told the boy he was dying . his parents were horrified . weeks later , crull passed away . 2 . the good luck charmers . every sport has its own strange traditions . i 'd argue hockey 's  throwing an octopus on the ice for good luck  is the weirdest . tossing the eight-tentacled cephalopod was the brainchild of detroit storeowners pete & jerry cusimano . the date : april 15 , 1952 . the logic : one tentacle for each of the eight victories it took to win the stanley cup . later that spring , most likely fueled by the good luck octopus , the red wings won the title . peta has objected to this practice , which continues to this day . the red wings mascot is not a red wing , but al the octopus . 3 . the john 3:16 guy . also known as  rainbow man ,  the born-again rollen stewart and his john 3:16 signs were fixtures at major events in the 1970s and 80s . he brought his message to the world series , super bowl , olympics , and world cup . he was outside buckingham palace when di and charles wed ; he went to see the pope in alaska . but he was more religious fanatic than sports fan . according to the los angeles times , stewart planned to assassinate president bush and candidate clinton in 1992 . and he 's now serving three life sentences for holding a maid hostage at a los angeles hyatt , also in 1992 . by the way , chapter three , verse sixteen of the gospel of john says ,  for god so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .  this is also printed on cups at the in-n-out burger . 4 . the all-star heckler . for 12 years , maryland lawyer and washington bullets fan robin ficker was the nba 's most prominent heckler . with season tickets behind the visiting team 's bench , his antics were legendary . when he reminded frank layden of the jazz that  usa today  had rated him worst dressed coach , layden had to be restrained by security . with the bulls in town , ficker loudly read excerpts of maverick , coach phil jackson 's sex-laden 1975 autobiography . during the 1993 suns-bulls nba finals , charles barkley -lrb- of the suns -rrb- flew ficker to phoenix and bought him a ticket behind the chicago bench . ficker was ejected in the first quarter . the bullets became the wizards in 1997 and moved into the mci center the following season . ficker 's new seats were not in shouting distance of the visiting team , forcing him into heckling retirement . last year he received 9.5 % of the vote in a losing bid for montgomery county executive . 5 . kim jong-il . that 's right , the world 's most feared dictator is a hoops junkie . during a 2000 visit , then-secretary of state madeleine albright presented him a basketball signed by michael jordan . the chicago bulls are the favorite team of kim jong-il , who reportedly has a video library with every game jordan ever played . at 5 ' 3  , the supreme commander of the korean people 's army is roughly the same height as muggsy bogues . 6 . david letterman 's stalker . david letterman 's biggest fan was also his biggest headache . when she was arrested for stealing dave 's porsche in 1988 , margaret ray told police she was mrs. letterman . she was a frequent trespasser on dave 's estate , once camping out on his tennis court . ray 's antics made her a regular monologue target . but the jokes stopped in 1998 , when ray jumped in front of a moving train . the collective guilt spread when we learned she was schizophrenic , as were her two brothers , who also committed suicide . 7 . joe from saddle river . a die-hard jets , mets and rangers fan , joe benigno was a frequent caller to wfan , new york 's all-sports radio station . benigno won the station 's fan appreciation day contest in 1994 , earning a chance to guest-host his own show . by 1995 , joe was wfan 's overnight guy , a title he held for almost a decade . in 2004 , he was deemed ready for daytime and given the 10 a.m.-1p . m. timeslot . for all the lonely and passionate talk radio callers out there , joe gives hope . 8 . steffi graf 's biggest fanatic . deranged and obsessed with seeing steffi graf return to the top of the rankings , gunter parche stabbed monica seles during a 1993 match in one of the most disturbing incidents in sports history . almost as disturbing was his punishment . parche received a two-year suspended sentence and was ordered to attend mandatory counseling . even more shocking , i ca n't find footage of any of this on youtube . also receiving votes : john hinckley ; the fan who started the pistons-pacers brawl in 2004 ; jeffrey maier ; the kissing bandit ;  butch  from middlebury ; metallica superfan-turned-bass player jason newstead ; and steve bartman . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
