{"text": "tampa , florida after witnessing the rapid devastation of a cayman island coral reef where he had been diving since childhood , todd barber was moved from horror to action . he gave up a six-figure salary as a marketing consultant and dedicated his life to restoring the world 's ocean reef ecosystems .  i had been following this reef since i had been 14 ; it was where my first dive was ,  recalls barber .  when that one little tiny reef was lost , that sparked something in me . if we lost one and it took that tens of thousands of years to get here , how fast is this happening ?  barber had caught a small glimpse of a larger global issue -- the destruction of the world 's coral reefs -- and it scared him . according to the nature conservancy , if the present rate of destruction continues , 70 percent of the world 's coral reefs will be destroyed by the year 2050 . not only are they home to 25 percent of all marine fish species , but the organization states that 500 million people rely on coral reefs for their food and livelihoods . so barber and his father , a marine biologist and fellow diver , sat down to devise a solution to  put the reef back .  what started as a basic idea to shape concrete around a beach ball led to three years of research , testing and prototyping with the help of friends and college professors . watch as barber explains his passion for saving reefs   our goal was to mimic nature , not dictate nature ,  says barber .  and that meant that i could n't come up with an idea ; i had to design something that would fit exactly what the reef required .  the result was what barber calls a  reef ball .  made of concrete engineered to last more than 500 years , reef balls are circular structures with a hollow center that serve as a base habitat upon which a natural reef can grow . portable , inexpensive and environmentally friendly , according to barber , reef balls can be built anywhere and are used to mimic and rehabilitate all forms of oceanic reefs , such as mangrove , oyster and coral reefs . they can also help control erosion and stabilize shorelines . watch as an organization in tampa tries to restore habitats for oysters  to manufacture and place reef balls in marine habitats around the world , barber established the reef ball foundation in 1993 . today , the non-profit organization works with environmental agencies , universities , community groups and corporations and empowers others to build and restore their local marine ecosystems .  -lsb- reefs -rsb- have an incredible bearing on human life ,  says barber .  without conserving these resources , they 're going to be all gone before we even know what we 've lost .  according to barber , marine conservation is n't just about reef balls , but they 're one important tool .  it 's about saving natural reefs . it 's about changing our behaviors ,  says barber .  it 's better to save the reef that you have than to build a new one .  since its inception , the reef ball foundation has placed reef balls in more than 59 countries .  for me , personally , the satisfaction comes from diving on a reef ball and seeing that the environment has been rehabilitated ; that the reef is actually there ,  says barber .  and that our grandkids will be able to see the same thing .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
