{"text": "president vladimir putin said on friday security threats had forced russia to revive the soviet-era practice of sending bomber aircraft on regular patrols beyond its borders . a russian strategic bomber flies over an airfield outside moscow during an air show . putin said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across russia in the early hours of friday on long-range missions .  we have decided to restore flights by russian strategic aviation on a permanent basis ,  putin told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with china and four central asian states in russia 's ural mountains .  today , august 17 at 00:00 hours , 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country , along with support and refueling aircraft ... from today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis .  we hope our partners will treat this with understanding .  at u.s. president george w. bush 's texas ranch , white house spokesman gordon johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the united states .  militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities , so this is not entirely surprising ,  he said . but the sorties are likely to add to western concern about russia 's growing assertiveness . that trend has prompted some u.s. policymakers to draw parallels with the cold war . putin caused a stir this year by saying russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in europe if washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern europe . russian diplomats have clashed with the united states and european governments on issues such as kosovo , energy , and moscow 's treatment of its ex-soviet neighbors . western military leaders have said this year that russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period . one western defense official called the flights  a little bit of chest-pounding , trying to let people know russia is back in the game  . putin said that when russia had cut its flights in 1992 , other military powers had not reciprocated .  flights by other countries ' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the russian federation ,  putin said . that appeared to be a swipe at the u.s. and nato , whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions . as putin spoke to reporters and television cameras , four russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while russian tanks trundled behind him , even though the exercises had ended long before . during the cold war , russian long-range bombers , which can carry strategic nuclear weapons , played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with western air forces . earlier this month russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the pacific island of guam , where the u.s. military has a base , and  exchanged smiles  with u.s. pilots scrambled to track them . the pentagon said the russian aircraft had not come close enough to u.s. ships to prompt american aircraft to react . in july , two russian tu-95  bear  bombers made unusually long sorties over the north sea , leading norway and britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them . russia 's air force said later it was a routine flight . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .", "summary": "no summary"}
