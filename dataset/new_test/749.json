{"text": "harare , zimbabwe zimbabwe 's opposition party said four of its activists and the wife of harare 's mayor -- an opposition member -- have been killed by supporters of president robert mugabe , just days ahead of next week 's presidential runoff . president robert mugabe says war veterans will take up arms again if tsvangirai wins . thursday 's report came as u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice accused mugabe of sponsoring efforts to starve , beat and kill supporters of his opponent morgan tzvangirai so he can win the election . rice was speaking on the same day that tendai biti , the opposition movement for democratic change 's secretary-general , was charged with treason after being held in jail without charges for a week . if convicted , he could face the death penalty . his arrest and treason charges have been criticized by african and international leaders who characterize it as a ploy by mugabe supporters to intimidate the opposition party before his june 27 runoff against tsvangirai . a spokesman for the mdc blamed mugabe 's zanu-pf party for the five most recent deaths , saying they brought to 70 the number of mdc party members killed since a bitterly contested election three months ago . the body of the mayor 's wife , 27-year-old abigail chiroto , was found in a mortuary close to the couple 's house north of harare . she had been beaten so severely with rocks and iron bars that her face was almost unrecognizable , mdc spokesman nelson chamisa said . watch cnn 's nkepile mabuse report on the violience  chiroto was kidnapped , along with her 4-year-old son , on tuesday . some of her kidnappers wore military uniforms , chamisa said . chiroto 's son was released unharmed . her husband , emmanuel chiroto , is an mdc member who was recently elected mayor of harare . he was not home at the time of the kidnapping . also thursday , the mdc said that four other activists were found dead in chitungwiza . the victims ' bodies showed evidence that  they were heavily tortured until they died ,  an mdc statement said .  it 's unbelievable the way people are being killed or murdered ,  chiroto said .  it 's almost mass butchering .  police confirmed the deaths of the activists but did not link the victims to any political party . mugabe 's party denied any part in the deaths , saying mdc officials made such accusations frequently .  they are claiming anyone who dies . they phone cnn ,  said bright matonga , a zanu-pf spokesman .  whenever someone dies in the hospital , they rush to claim them .  matonga said harare was run by a commission .  there is no mdc mayor in zimbabwe ,  he said .  there is no newly elected mayor in harare .  learn more about zimbabwe  in new york , rice convened a meeting about the situation in zimbabwe at the united nations on thursday .  mugabe is increasing violence against -lsb- the -rsb- opposition . ... president mugabe has squandered the promise of the very nation that was hailed as the jewel of africa ,  rice said at a roundtable discussion attended by representatives from many international governments .  clearly we have reached a point where broader , stronger , international effort is needed ,  she added . on friday , a magistrate judge will determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with a trial against biti . the judge also will determine whether biti will be granted bail or will continue to be jailed until the trial . biti was charged thursday with treason , communicating false information prejudicial to the state , bringing the office of the president into disrepute and causing disaffection among armed forces , according to a journalist who was in the harare courtroom . he denies all the charges . watch biti arrive for his court hearing  biti , wearing a red jacket and looking exhausted , held his head in his hands as the proceedings took place in the packed courtroom .  i think that one must express very serious objection to the manner in which this whole case is being handled ,  said tsvangirai , who was in court .  the accusations are frivolous .  three of the charges stem from a document titled  the transitional strategy ,  which biti is said to have written ahead of the march 29 election . biti is denying that he wrote the document , and his lawyers described it as  doctored .  the fourth charge of communicating falsehoods alleges that biti announced that tsvangirai had won the march presidential election by an outright majority , meaning no runoff vote would be needed . in recent weeks , opposition groups and churches have reported numerous cases of kidnappings , torture and other violence in the country targeting opponents of mugabe . zanu-pf members have been suspected of being behind the acts . zanu-pf claims that the mdc is behind the violence . it said mdc members attacked the mayor of kadoma , a city 140 km -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- southwest of harare . it also accused mdc activists of causing millions of dollars damage to private business . last week , mugabe warned that veterans he commanded in his country 's liberation war nearly three decades ago would take up arms again if tsvangirai won . watch an ad vilifying tsvangirai  the mdc is using word of mouth and file-sharing sites such as youtube to disseminate its campaign advertisements , claiming that they are banned by state media . the group sent advertisements to supporters via e-mail , asking them to forward them to their friends and relatives .  since the regime has denied the mdc access to state media , please send the adverts to as many people as you can ,  the e-mail says .  a new zimbabwe is near . the dictator is finished . let 's finish it !  mugabe has been zimbabwe 's only leader since the war ended in 1980 but is blamed for the economic collapse of a country once considered a regional breadbasket . zimbabweans increasingly are unable to afford food and other essentials , with agriculture paralyzed by land reform and the world 's highest rate of inflation . police have arrested tsvangirai several times in the weeks leading up to the runoff , most recently on saturday , with 11 other officials and supporters from his party . south african president thabo mbeki met mugabe and tsvangirai on wednesday in the hope of quelling tensions . mbeki was visiting in his capacity as mediator with the 14-nation southern african development community , the south african government said wednesday . he is under domestic and international pressure for his perceived conciliatory stance toward mugabe , but the south african leader recently said he would continue his quiet diplomacy despite recent events . cnn 's nkepile mabuse contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
