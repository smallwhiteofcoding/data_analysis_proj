{"text": "washington with the election of the next president a year away , sen. hillary clinton remains the person to beat , a cnn/opinion research corporation poll released monday suggests . as the countdown begins to november 4 , 2008 , the new york democrat continues to dominate the race for the democratic presidential nomination , and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the gop front-runner , former new york mayor rudy giuliani . but clinton 's path to the white house is in no way certain . clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week , and her rivals for the democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on iraq , iran and other major issues . the republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the democratic front-runner , with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping clinton . the attacks may be working . the cnn/opinion research polls suggests that clinton 's support has slipped from its height one month ago . watch cnn 's bill schneider on the latest poll numbers   clinton 's strength is about where it was throughout the summer , indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that obama has not yet cut into her core constituency ,  cnn political director keating holland said . clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely democratic voters interviewed for the poll . her closest rival , sen. barack obama of illinois , was the top choice of 25 percent , and former sen. john edwards of north carolina has 14 percent . all other democratic candidates were in single digits . new mexico gov. bill richardson was backed by 4 percent , sen. joe biden of delaware by 3 percent , sen. christopher dodd by 2 percent , ohio rep. dennis kucinich by 2 percent and former alaska sen. mike gravel was at 1 percent . the poll involved 467 interviews conducted on november 2-4 with democrats or independents who lean democratic . the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . view the poll results  in an october cnn/opinion research poll , clinton was supported by 51 percent of democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over obama . during last week 's democratic debate , clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow democratic presidential rivals , who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the iowa caucus in early january . edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate , criticizing clinton for her stance on iraq , iran and social security .  the american people ... deserve a president of the united states that they know will tell them the truth and wo n't say one thing one time and something different at a different time ,  edwards said . edwards has also accused clinton of being a  corporate democrat  too willing to defend a  corrupt  washington establishement .  we desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in washington that 's become broken , corruption has crept into it , and we have to tell the truth about that ,  edwards said monday .  if you defend that system , i do n't believe you can bring about the change that america needs .  in the republican presidential race , giuliani continues to be the leading candidate , with the backing of 28 percent of the republican primary voters polled . former sen. fred thompson of tennessee was backed by 19 percent . sen. john mccain of arizona was the top pick of 16 percent , and former massachusetts gov. mitt romney had 11 percent . of the remaining republican candidates , former arkansas gov. mike huckabee received 10 percent , texas rep. ron paul 5 percent , california rep. duncan hunter 4 percent and colorado rep. tom tancredo 3 percent . the poll involved telephone interviews with 397 republicans or independents who lean republican . the poll 's margin of error was 5 percentage points . in a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners , clinton leads giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent . that lead has increased since october , when clinton led giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent .  the overall political environment seems to favor the democrats , partly because democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood , which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party ,  holland said . only 42 percent of americans think things are going well , while 58 percent think things are going badly , the poll found .  the public is not just pessimistic about the country -- americans are angry ,  holland said .  more than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country .  clinton 's lead over giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances , the poll found . in a three-way race , clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters , giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent . the poll 's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent .  my analysis of it is that -lsb- a third-party candidate -rsb- is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me ,  giuliani said .  you know it is a tactic , and a legitimate one . people have to think about that and consider it .  the lack of enthusiasm for giuliani , particularly by social conservatives , could spell trouble for the gop next year if he becomes the nominee , holland said .  only 27 percent of republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if giuliani won the gop nod , and the remaining gop candidates fare even worse ,  he said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
