{"text": "voluble gary vaynerchuk , 31 , the host of  wine library tv ,  an online video show , has been known to lick rocks , suck leather and eat dirt while on camera , all to illustrate the unique properties of wine .  wine library tv  host gary vaynerchuk discusses four spooky wine varieties for halloween show . of a  wild and gamey  red from rioja , spain , vaynerchuk says ,  hit a deer on the road . throw a bunch of cherries on it . take out your knife , cut the deer . bite it . that 's the flavor profile .  that kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers . across the internet , budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of web sites , blogs , bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand . about 40,000 internet viewers -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with  wine library tv .  the low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that vaynerchuk 's family owns in springfield , new jersey . vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate , and he does n't dumb down his subject . yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a wine spectator critic would be unlikely to employ . the mission of wine sites like  wine library tv ,  say several of the people behind these new outlets , is to demystify wine -lrb- and in some cases , sell it , too -rrb- . using the language , attitude and new media that appeal to a young , tech-savvy generation , they advocate trusting one 's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics . some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions . one site , savoreachglass.com , declares its dedication to  exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation ,  with reviews , online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking -- all with attitude .  the -lrb- wine -rrb- establishment is about ratings and ` reputation , '  says the site 's founder , tynan szvetecz , 29 .  it 's about collecting the ` good ' stuff as defined by someone else 's palate and tastes . that bores a younger generation .   we 're not afraid to be smartasses ,  he continues .  we make fun of ourselves , old-world wine makers , new-world wine makers , and anyone else we can get our hands on .  in the u.s. , interest in wine is exploding . while consumption has leveled out in traditional wine-producing countries such as france , italy and spain , especially among young people , it has trended upwards in the u.s. for 15 straight years . the u.s. is projected to overtake no. 2 italy by the end of 2007 , according to the annual report the u.s. wine market : impact databank review and forecast a leading industry trade publication . many of the new converts to wine are the so-called millennials , the under-30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they 're also called igen , or the internet generation . one of the wine web sites targeting a younger demographic is vinesugar.com , which features a blog called  wine burps .   we love wine but hate the elitism ,  writes founder , ryan o'donnell .  after all , it 's just grape juice .  with rants about wine tasting fees , a feature spotlighting  wine hotties  working at california wineries , as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries , vinesugar.com leaves little doubt about its target audience . cellartracker.com , an online wine community , appeals to more established wine collectors . the site provides free software -- designed by eric levine , a fortuitously named former microsoft software developer -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines . the 39,000 users -lrb- who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars -rrb- post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via pdas and cell phones . community tasting notes shed light on how cellar-worthy wines are evolving , helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle . corkd.com , another online community of wine fans , already had 40,000 users when vaynerchuk purchased the site last year . the free service allows users to catalog and review wines . instead of having  friends  as on facebook , members identify  drinking buddies  and check out what they 're drinking . in the growing presence of wine fans on the internet -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- vaynerchuk sees a movement .  they 're part of forums , they meet up -lrb- offline -rrb- ,  he says .  it 's about bringing people together . it 's all that 's right about wine .  vaynerchuk should know . the 300-plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans , who call themselves  vayniacs ,  share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site 's forum . on a recent rainy afternoon , vaynerchuk barreled , unrehearsed and unscripted , through a 20-minute show in a single take . he wrapped up wine library tv episode no. 337 with what has become his signature line .  you , with a little bit of me , we 're changing the wine world , are n't we ?  e-mail to a friend . lifewire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to web publishers . neil edward schlecht is a freelance writer based in litchfield county , connecticut and the author of more than a dozen travel
