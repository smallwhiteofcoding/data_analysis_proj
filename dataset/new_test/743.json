{"text": "washington congress passed a $ 300 billion farm bill over president bush 's veto for a second time wednesday , a step made necessary by a clerical error when the original bill passed . congress overrode president bush 's second veto of a $ 300 billion farm bill . the senate voted 80-14 to approve the measure over bush 's objections , following a 317-109 vote in the house of representatives . both votes were well above the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto , which bush delivered wednesday morning . congress overrode an earlier veto of the farm bill last month , even though lawmakers had discovered that 34 pages were missing in the version originally sent to the white house . in spiking the latest version , bush said he objected to its continued subsidies for the wealthy and its use of budget gimmicks to hide a $ 20 billion increase in spending . but sen. kent conrad , the chairman of the senate budget committee , said the measure actually saves the government $ 110 million .  this bill does not add to the deficit or debt , because this bill is paid for ,  he said .  that is not my claim . that is the finding of the congressional budget office .  the discovery of the missing section , title iii , prompted concerns from house republicans that the override vote was improper . house speaker nancy pelosi said the sections of the bill that were originally sent to the president had become law after congress voted to override bush 's first veto . but to put title iii into effect , congress re-passed the entire legislation , including the missing pages , and resent it to bush . the house voted 306-110 at the end of may . the senate voted 77-15 for the bill at the beginning of june . two-thirds of the $ 300 billion in spending for the farm bill will go for nutrition programs such as food stamps . another $ 40 billion will go toward farm subsidies , and $ 30 billion is allocated for payments to farms to keep land idle and other environmental programs . after vetoing the latest version of the farm bill , bush scolded congress on wednesday for not  modifying certain objectionable , onerous and fiscally imprudent provisions . ... i am returning this bill for the same reasons as stated in my veto message .  when he vetoed the first version of the farm bill , bush said it  continues subsidies for the wealthy and increases farm bill spending by more than $ 20 billion , while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase .  the president said it would hurt efforts to improve american farmers ' access to overseas markets . congress has passed one other bill over bush 's objections : legislation for a $ 23 billion water project that the president vetoed in 2007 . cnn capitol hill producer deirdre walsh contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
