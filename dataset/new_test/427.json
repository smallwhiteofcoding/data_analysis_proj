{"text": "jakarta , indonesia an indonesian court has sentenced the alleged military commander of an al qaeda-linked terror network to 15 years in prison . abu dujana is suspected of plotting attacks on the australian embassy and j.w. marriott hotel in jakarta . abu dujana is the alleged leader of the military wing of jemaah islamiyah , a group that is thought to be linked to al qaeda . it aims to create a muslim  superstate  across much of southeast asia . dujana , a slight , wiry man , is accused of direct involvement in the bali nightclub bombings of 2002 that killed more than 200 , mostly western , tourists . he is also suspected of plotting subsequent attacks on the australian embassy and j.w. marriott hotel , both in the indonesian capital , jakarta . furthermore , authorities say dujana is behind the violence in poso , on indonesia 's eastern sulawesi island . fighting between muslims and christians periodically breaks out in the region and sometimes turns deadly . police have accused jemaah islamiyah of sending armed militants to poso . the court found dujana guilty monday of illegally possessing firearms and explosives , and of harboring suspected terrorists . his lawyers said they may appeal the sentence . after his arrest last june following a four-year hunt , dujana admitted to cnn that he was jemaah islamiyah 's military chief . but he said that happened only after the attacks on western targets . he described jemaah islamiyah to cnn as  an underground organization ,  saying  it will continue to exist and continue to move on with its plans  to create an islamic state under sharia law despite his capture .  when a part of it is cut off ... there will be a replacement , it 's only natural ,  he said . dujana denied being involved in the marriott hotel attack . he told cnn that he helped fugitive suspect noordin top plan the attack , meeting him both before and after the devastating blast that killed 12 people and injured 150 .  it 's true , i did have a meeting with noordin before the marriott bombing but that does n't mean i was involved in the attack ,  he said .  in that meeting , we 're just aligning our views with each other -- there was absolutely no discussion about planning any bombing .  in his cnn interview , dujana was quick with messages of hate , calling all westerners legitimate targets because of the actions of leaders like u.s. president george w. bush and then-british prime minister tony blair , who he says are not giving muslims the chance to be in power . dujana studied in pakistan and fought in afghanistan from 1988 to 1991 . he told cnn that he met al qaeda leader osama bin laden in afghanistan during the fight against soviet occupation . at the time , bin laden was a field commander and he was an ordinary soldier , he said . dujana said bin laden was well respected then and helped him and others realize that it was permissible to kill people to defend islam .  i did n't read it in the quran ,  he said .  it 's based on the teachings of our teachers , clerics , especially what osama bin laden first said .   because of america 's arrogance , many in the muslim world know , believe , it 's permissible to kill american soldiers . it 's halal ; it 's permitted ,  he said . the court declared jemaah islamiyah a terrorist organization monday and ordered it to pay 10 million rupiah -lrb- $ 1,088 -rrb- . around the same time dujana was captured last june , authorities also apprehended jemaah islamiyah 's leader , known simply as zarkasih . a verdict on his case is expected soon . last week , two other top jemaah islamiyah leaders -- dr. agus purwanto and abdur rohim -- were brought to indonesia following their arrest in malaysia . both are being investigated for their possible role in fomenting violence in poso . terrorism expert sidney jones says abdur rohim is believed to have replaced zarkasih as jemaah islamiyah leader .  it is another major blow to jemaah islamiyah , but difficult to tell what the impact will be ,  jones told cnn via e-mail last week .  it could embolden a more militant faction . -lsb- it -rsb- could also lead to some serious reassessment within the organization about its future .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's kathy quiano contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
