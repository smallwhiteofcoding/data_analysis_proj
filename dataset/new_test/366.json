{"text": "steven spielberg led the fbi straight to a stolen $ 700,000 norman rockwell painting someone snatched from a missouri gallery . it was in his collection in california . the original of this norman rockwell reproduction was found in the collection of steven spielberg last year . spielberg was n't the thief , and he does n't know who took rockwell 's  russian schoolroom  -- an oil of 16 pupils looking at a bust of lenin . all the a-list director knows is he paid about $ 200,000 for the 16 x 37 canvas in a legitimate purchase . the fbi says its just one example of how pilfered art lands in respectable places . and it was an uncommon ending for stolen art -- someone found it . recovering masterpieces happens in less than 5 percent of cases , said bonnie magness-gardiner , the fbi 's art theft program manager . usually , expensive pieces go missing . no one knows who took them . no one gets prosecuted , and everyone wonders ,  why steal something you ca n't turn to cash quickly ?  art thieves do a simple risk versus reward evaluation , said corine wegener , associate curator of the minneapolis institute of arts . thieves know that  even if they receive only a fraction of the work 's market value , the cash gained was at low risk of death or injury -- museums can be a relatively soft target ,  said wegener , who 's teaching a university of minnesota class this month on art theft . but it could be years -- or never -- before the thief sees even a small payoff . in 1990 , robbers took $ 300 million worth of certified masterpieces -- among them rembrandt 's  storm on the sea of galilee  and vermeer 's  the concert  -- from the isabella stewart gardner museum in boston , massachusetts . no one 's seen them since . on sunday , robbers made off with one of the biggest art hauls in european history , grabbing four paintings worth an estimated $ 163 million from the e.g. buehrle collection in zurich , switzerland . they took works by paul cezanne , edgar degas , claude monet and vincent van gogh . see what robbers grabbed in switzerland   these paintings are extremely valuable on the open market , but they 'll never go onto the open market . so at the same time they 're both priceless and worthless ,  said charles hill , the former chief of scotland yard 's art and antiques unit .  some thieves may buy into the myth that a wealthy but unscrupulous collector will contact them and offer to take the art off their hands ,  wegener said .  when this does n't happen , the thieves often try to ransom the art back to the museum or the insurance company .  one london art dealer , who said he has handled stolen works , told cnn on condition of anonymity that an insurance company would rather get art back at a fraction of its original price than pay the owner its insured value . watch how art thieves operate  ransoming art to an insurance company through an intermediary adds  up to 10 percent of the market value , which ... given the art market , is quite a lot of money ,  the dealer said . david vuillaume , secretary general of the swiss museums association , told time magazine that ransom may be what the thieves behind the swiss heist want .  we are thinking that maybe in a week or two there will be a ransom demand . but we just have to wait and see ,  time quoted him as saying . the museum has offered $ 90,000 reward for information leading to their recovery , time reported . options for art thieves . julian radcliffe , chairman of the art loss register , which operates a database to help recover lost and stolen art , said ransom or reward are unlikely to bring results .  it is very seldom that people have been able to undertake a ransom ,  he said .  this gang might think that a reward has been offered , and that they 'll get the reward .  but in fact ,  the reward wo n't be paid unless someone is arrested , or there is proper criminal intelligence ,  and that 's unlikely to happen , radcliffe said . he said the thieves may just be patient , willing to get their payoff decades later . or the art may move through an underground network , gradually increasing in value , before being slipped back onto the legitimate market . take spielberg . he bought  schoolroom  in an above-the-board transaction .  usually , these pictures will change hands in the criminal underworld at a fraction -- 1 percent or less -- of their true market value ,  radcliffe said , before someone tries to get them back into the international market . in such an effort , the seller may hope the work has been forgotten over time or they may disguise it as a copy or student re-creation .  they may try and sell them not as being by degas , but as being a copy , or school , or by a follower of one of the great artists . and that is the ways in which they try and get them on the market ,  radcliffe said . the original thieves rarely face justice , the fbi 's magness-gardiner said .  the stolen items turn up years , sometimes decades , after the theft ,  she said .  because a work of art does not require a title document in order to be transferred from one owner to another , a stolen object easily enters the legitimate stream of commerce .  it is impossible to trace them back to the original thief in most cases . even if the original thief can be identified , there is also a statute of limitations on prosecution for theft ,  magness-gardiner said . what happens to stolen art ? even if the art is recovered , original owners may not get it back . while museum pieces are likely to go back to their collections , private owners may not be so lucky .  russian schoolroom  remains in spielberg 's possession while courts determine the rightful owner , a spokesman for the director said . but art stolen from a los angeles mansion and sold in sweden remains with its swedish purchasers , according to a case file posted on the web site of the los angeles police department 's art theft detail . even though the thief was caught ,  the swedish government refused to return the paintings , claiming that according to swedish law , the auction buyers had purchased the paintings in good faith ,  according to the web site . in the case of rockwell 's  russian schoolroom ,  someone took it from a gallery in clayton , missouri , a st. louis suburb , in 1973 , according to an fbi synopsis of the case . in 2004 , the fbi 's art crime team found out that the piece had been for sale at a new york rockwell exhibition 15 years earlier and posted a picture and description of the painting on its art recovery web site . spielberg 's staff learned of the search and told the fbi that spielberg had it in his collection in los angeles . he had purchased it from a legitimate dealer in 1989 , an fbi press release said . the agency also determined the painting was auctioned in new orleans in 1988 , but it has yet to determine who took the painting or its whereabouts from 1973 to 1988 . whoever took  russian schoolroom  from the suburban st. louis gallery in 1973 , or the masterpieces from the boston museum 1980 , or the works lifted in zurich this week , should n't be mistaken for a high-society , tuxedo-wearing ,  thomas crown affair  kind of thief , radcliffe said .  these people are the worst sort of criminal . they are just like the criminals who traffic individuals or sell children , or murder .  they are thoroughly unpleasant people . there is no romanticism in anyway that should be connected to it .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's paula hancocks and teresa martini contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
