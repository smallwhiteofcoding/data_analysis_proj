{"text": "glasgow , scotland -- world champions italy clinched qualification for euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 2-1 victory at hampden park -- killing off scotland 's hopes of reaching the finals . luca toni celebrates his early goal as italy won 2-1 in scotland to clinch qualification from group b. luca toni shot italy in front but scotland recovered to dominate and barry ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller . however , christian panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award italy a free-kick . the result also means france have sealed qualification , along with italy , from group b without playing a game . in a match played in torrential rain , italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds . gianluca zambrotta spotted antonio di natale unmarked in the box , and picked him out with a throw-in as scotland were caught napping . di natale swept the ball into the path of toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out . the home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later . this time , toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by mauro camoranesi who fired over from close-range . toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from craig gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post . at the other end , scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from lee mcculloch appeared to be handled by zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored . spurred on by a sense of injustice , the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors . ferguson fired over from a james mcfadden corner , before alan hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the everton man . scotland then produced some wonderful passing football , which culminated in a tight-angled drive from ferguson , but gianluigi buffon dived low to smother . then came another scare for the home side . gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from massimo ambrosini , before di natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net . the assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong . only last-gasp defending from the italians prevented the scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time . david weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet ferguson 's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before andrea pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line . a free-kick in a dangerous area provided italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when paul hartley hauled down camoranesi just outside the box . pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but , despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist , his effort was easily dealt with by gordon . instead , it was scotland who found the back of the net as hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone . mcfadden 's free-kick deflected into the path of mcculloch in front of goal . he was denied by buffon , but the rebound fell kindly to ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range . with just over 15 minutes to go , scott brown was withdrawn for kenny miller as scotland went for broke . the derby striker quickly began to cause the italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of mcfadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score . scotland 's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for euro 2008 . hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and panucci rose to meet pirlo 's cross and nod home the winner . italy coach roberto donadoni said :  we knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere .  but through their character and desire , the lads were fantastic . they worked so hard , they deserve this . qualifying for euro 2008 is amazing . it 's something positive after all that happened last week -lrb- the death of the lazio fan -rrb- .  captain fabio cannavaro :  this was a victory won with the heart . it was difficult to play in this stadium , with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron .  we played really well and managed to win . we showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions .  in italy we play a high level of football , we 've won the champions league and the world cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
