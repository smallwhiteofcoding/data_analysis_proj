{"text": "a corpus christi , texas , hospital is investigating how up to 17 babies in a neonatal intensive care unit received overdoses of the blood thinner heparin . one of the babies died . officials at christus spohn hospital south say corrective action was taken after the discovery of the overdoses . the infant was one of 17 who may have received a more concentrated form of heparin than was prescribed , christus spohn hospital south said in a statement . heparin is an anticoagulant often used to clean the ivs of patients and prevent blood clots from forming in the lines . it came into the public spotlight last year when newborn twins of actor dennis quaid nearly died after receiving an overdose at a los angeles hospital . nursing staff at the corpus christi hospital discovered the problem sunday -- two days after the medication is believed to have been first administered , according to bruce holstien , president and ceo of christus spohn health system . the hospital said it took corrective measures after the discovery . a preliminary investigation concluded that  the medication error occurred during the mixing process within the hospital pharmacy ,  holstein said in a statement . the baby who died  was seriously ill , and we do not know at this time what role , if any , the higher than expected concentration of heparin played in this baby 's death ,  dr. richard davis , chief medical officer for the health system , said tuesday .  our deepest sympathy goes out to this family ,  he said . twelve of the 16 other babies remain in stable condition in the neonatal intensive care unit , which cares for ill newborns . three have been discharged , and one is critical and unstable as that baby has been since admission to the unit , davis said . in november , quaid 's 12-day-old twins , thomas boone and zoe grace , were undergoing intravenous antibiotic treatment for a staph infection at cedars-sinai medical center in los angeles . according to standard procedure , nurses were supposed to clean the infants ' iv lines with hep-lock , a drug containing a small dose of heparin , to allow the lines to flow freely . however , instead of the 10 units of heparin they were supposed to receive , the twins received 10,000 units -- 1,000 times the prescribed amount . the babies survived , apparently with no permanent injury , quaid later told members of a house committee on government oversight , although there is no way to know whether they will show any long-term effects .", "summary": "no summary"}
