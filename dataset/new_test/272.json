{"text": "new york in the days after benazir bhutto 's assassination , it will be tempting to reach two hasty conclusions : that she was pakistan 's last great hope and that her geo-politically crucial country has revealed itself to be inherently hopeless . irshad manji is a controversial muslim feminist and activist from toronto , canada . on each front , i take a different view . while far more liberal and democratic than gen. musharraf , bhutto disappointed moderate , modern pakistanis with her adherence to feudal politics . writing to me through my web site , american feminists say they are  aching  over the loss of  our dear , sweet , brave benazir .  i understand the sentiment . but  brave  is not the word used by pakistani women from whom i 've also heard . they 're hurting more over bhutto 's  self-imposed  conformity .  she never realized her potential ,  a woman from karachi tells me .  and not because she was killed but because when she had the chance , she did not effectively challenge the backward mindset that has now led to her demise .  for example , during bhutto 's time in office , pakistan did n't defy the anti-female rape and adultery laws . those notorious ordinances , known as hudood , took their inspiration from tribal politics masquerading as islam . watch manji argue on cnn why bhutto 's legacy is mixed  imagine the opportunity : bhutto could have championed a purer faith by tackling corrupt cultural practices . in so doing , she might have created allies among conservatives , who can be persuaded that although islam is god-given , culture is man-made . last year , a media campaign to strike down the hudood ordinances achieved this fine balance . but not because of her . and that , say many progressive pakistanis , amputates bhutto 's legacy . the fact that cruel laws against women can be publicly debated at all should suggest that pakistan has hope anyway . an exceptional leader can tap into it . history tells us so . there was a time when pakistan 's democratic politicians stuck it to the feudal fanatics . bhutto 's father , zulfikar ali bhutto , was once heckled by a religious fundamentalist .  you drink alcohol !  shouted the critic .  yes ,  retorted the elder bhutto ,  but i do n't drink the blood of the people !  his response captured the spirit of muhammad ali jinnah , pakistan 's founder . in 1947 , jinnah exuded high hopes for his people :  you are free . you are free to go to your temples , you are free to go to your mosques , or to any other place of worship in the state of pakistan .  you may belong to any religion or caste or creed . that has nothing to do with the business of the state . we are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens of one state ... you will find that in due course of time , hindus will cease to be hindus and muslims will cease to be muslims , not in the religious sense ... but in the political sense as citizens of the state .  jinnah meant every word of his unconventional vision because he , himself , lived as a maverick . he adored his non-muslim wife , and his sister often appeared with him on the campaign trail . her visibility attested to islam 's embrace of women as partners of men . in the months ahead , the people of pakistan will need to recall jinnah 's vision . it may be of comfort know that they 're not alone . countless americans are now asking about their founders ' intentions , desperate to re-discover the better angels of their country after eight years of george w. bush . still , pakistan must avoid america 's enduring mistake . the united states lapsed into profound divisiveness following the assassinations of martin luther king jr. and robert f. kennedy . many would argue that today 's politics of polarization can be traced to the unresolved trauma of the king-kennedy murders . for pakistan , it 's high time to transcend both trauma and tribalism . i pray that in death , benazir bhutto will be the catalyst for a deeper democracy than she ever advocated in life . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
