{"text": "the legend of jack daniel reaches all the way back to the moment he was born . unfortunately , nobody knows exactly when that was . jack daniel believed the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey . some records show that jasper newton  jack  daniel came into the world on september 5 , 1846 . his tombstone , however , says 1850 . strange , because his mother died in 1847 . all of this might not normally matter , but jack 's birth date is important to his overall legend , which proudly proclaims him  the boy distiller .  so perhaps it 's best we begin when jack was first introduced to whiskey , which we know was early in life . leaving home at a young age , jack struck out on his own with nothing more than a handful of items valued at $ 9 . he ended up at the home of dan call , a preacher at a nearby lutheran church and the owner of a general store . there , reverend call also happened to sell whiskey that he distilled himself . jack quickly became determined to learn the craft . in fact , many storytellers claim the boy wonder bought the still from call and began pursuing the business full-time at the ripe age of 16 . if that legend is true , then jack began selling his own tennessee whiskey only three years later ; the famous black labels on the company bottles proudly pronounce ,  established and registered in 1866 .  in reality , no documents support that myth . jack may have been a teenage moonshiner , but he did n't register his business with the federal government until 1875 . and by then , jack would have been the more booze-appropriate age of 29 . the maker makes his mark . whatever legends exist , one thing is certain : jack daniel had a brilliant mind for marketing . even as a youngster , jack understood that if people remembered him , they would remember his whiskey . to that end , he decked himself out in a formal knee-length coat , a vest , a tie , and a wide-brim planter 's hat , and was never caught out of  uniform  again . jack also established the jack daniel 's silver cornet band -- a 10-member outfit solely devoted to promoting his whiskey across the countryside . with uniforms and instruments from the sears & roebuck catalog and a specially designed wagon for traveling , jack made sure the band played every saloon opening , fourth of july celebration , and political rally around . but perhaps jack 's most brilliant decision concerned how to present his whiskey . from the beginning , jack had been one of the first sellers to stencil his distillery name on his whiskey jugs . next , he upgraded to round , custom-embossed bottles . but when a glass salesman showed him a prototype square bottle in 1895 , jack realized he 'd stumbled upon something unique . the new bottles not only stood out from the crowd , but also had a shape that would prevent them from rolling around and breaking during transport . in addition , the square look reinforced the idea that jack was a square dealer who put honest work and high standards first . whatever effort jack daniel put into his marketing , he never let quality slip . in 1904 , the distiller decided on a whim to enter his whiskey in the taste competition at the st. louis world 's fair . it came as little surprise when he won . lucky no. 7 . perhaps jack 's greatest coup was the name he gave his high-quality product -- old no. 7 . naturally , nobody seems to know why . the official historian at the jack daniel distillery today says it 's the most oft-asked question on factory tours . as you might imagine , many theories have been advanced . jack had seven girlfriends . jack believed the number seven was lucky . jack was honoring a merchant friend who owned seven stores that distributed jack 's liquor . jack misplaced a batch of whiskey for seven years and , upon finding it , labeled it  old no. 7 .  none of these stories , however , makes as much sense as the less-than-sexy explanation from jack daniel biographer peter krass . simply put , jack was originally assigned a district tax assessment number of 7 . but when the irs consolidated districts within tennessee , they arbitrarily reassigned him the number 16 . jack did n't want to confuse his loyal consumers , and he certainly did n't want to bend to the government , so he began labeling his bottles  old no. 7 .  more than 125 years later , this act of defiance still makes his labels stand out . jack without jill . jack daniel never married . some say it 's because he was married to his work ; others say it 's because he never found a girl who measured up to his high standards . or perhaps it 's just that he was too busy catering to the greater lynchburg population -- throwing elaborate christmas feasts , hosting exquisite costume parties in his second-story ballroom , and donating money to every church in moore county . but by all accounts , jack was quite a ladies ' man . he was a perfect dance partner , a polite conversationalist , and a fantastic gift-giver . unfortunately , he also gravitated toward girls young enough to be his daughter -lrb- or even granddaughter -rrb- . once , jack even asked for a woman 's hand in marriage , but her father denied him -- partly because jack enjoyed keeping his own legend alive and always hesitated to reveal his true birth date . when jack proposed , her father made it clear that any man unwilling to disclose his age was  a little too old for such a young girl .  the early bird gets the gangrene . hard as it might be to believe , in the end , the great distiller actually died from getting to work too early . as the story goes , one morning in 1906 , jack arrived at his office before anybody else . he tried to access the company safe , but had a terrible time remembering the code . after a few frustrating minutes , he kicked the safe as hard as he could . he badly bruised his left foot and immediately began to walk with a limp . the limp only grew worse with time , and he later discovered the injury had led to blood poisoning . then came gangrene , then amputation , and then , five years later , death . it 's not the happiest ending for the story , or the clearest cut , but it is the best , because it adds to the mystery and mystique of jack daniel . as they say , where facts can not be found , legends fill the empty space and that 's perfectly fine for the keepers of the company flame . after all , as jack himself believed , the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
