{"text": "london , england handsome , articulate and lightning fast -- mclaren 's lewis hamilton can now add two more words to his list of qualities : very rich . lewis hamilton will be able to afford a lot more champagne in the future . the briton is set to become one of the most marketable sport stars in the world -- perhaps second only to tiger woods -- and earn more than a billion dollars if he can maintain the buzz created by his first season in formula one , experts say . on sunday he started his second season in perfect fashion , easily winning the australian grand prix in melbourne . the 23-year-old signed a five-year contract with mclaren worth an estimated $ 140m in january . it leaves him lagging along way behind ferrari 's kimi raikkonen , who is paid an estimated $ 50m a year for driving , but it is through endorsements that he stands to reap a greater windfall . stephen cheliotis , chief executive of the centre for brand analysis and uk superbrands and coolbrands councils ' chairman , said hamilton was the most marketable driver because he was a breath of fresh air . he had helped drive up race attendance and television fewer figures dramatically in his first season .  he is young , mixing with the right people everyday -- rappers , film stars -- and a lot more articulate than kimi raikkonen ,  cheliotis said .  he is also the first black driver and it does have a bearing , much like tiger woods in golf . he is also the most marketable because he is going to be the best , much like michael schumacher .  pippa collett , sponsorship consulting 's managing director , said hamilton was certainly the most marketable driver in the short term . his performance meant he was the dominant member of a group of  young turks  -- nelson piquet jr , nico rosberg , heikki kovalainen -- who had great potential . collett said in terms of the media hamilton 's performance , friendliness , english speaking background and professionalism were key assets . if he could maintain these he would earn more than schumacher -- the sport 's first billionaire driver . indeed , schumacher set an example which hamilton would be wise to follow . he was the first driver to win personal sponsors after ferrari allowed him to sign a $ 10m annual deal with a german bank to place its logo on his cap . the german also actively pursued the development of his own retail range , which included caps -- he sold hundreds of thousands at $ 30 a pop -- and even a branded vacuum cleaner . collett said schumacher 's manager , willi weber , was very good .  schumacher was a nice guy but not very charming . however , he was very professional and you knew he would turn up ,  collett said . cheliotis agreed hamilton would earn considerably more than schumacher , and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers . however , there were pitfalls . lewis had already made the mistake of saying he was moving to switzerland to avoid the limelight when it was all about avoiding tax , cheliotis said .  he said that and then turned up at every awards night for a month .  cheliotis said appearing arrogant , being caught out by the tabloid press , endorsing a brand and then using another and over selling himself could also damage his value .  the big danger with someone like hamilton is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion . there is a danger of being one of 50 sponsors and not getting any value .  collett said hamilton needed to develop his  life-time brand  . while raikkonen may not be a media darling he had developed an  iceman  image , which was just as important in the long term . english footballer david beckham , whose performance had dropped off , had successfully developed a life-time brand that would out last his playing career . collett said hamilton 's one weakness may be his father , anthony .  his dad is his manager . your brand positioning is as an individual ... having your dad around too much could affect your brand .  collett said hamilton would have to be wary of bad press , but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel .  i think that is part of the glamour ... some of that and continued brilliant performances will make his life very easy .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
