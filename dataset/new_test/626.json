{"text": "washington a woman who helped raise a child with her female partner in vermont before the pair split can visit the girl in virginia even though that state does n't recognize same-sex unions , a court ruled friday . janet jenkins with isabella , the daughter she helped raise with former partner lisa miller . virginia 's supreme court ruled that janet jenkins and lisa miller 's civil union in 2000 gave vermont , and its law on same-sex unions , jurisdiction over their subsequent custody and visitation disputes . miller moved to virginia with the child in 2003 , and a vermont court granted jenkins visitation rights . but miller took the case to a virginia court , which ruled that jenkins had no such rights there . the case was considered by legal experts to be the first conflict between two state courts over a major legal question arising from same-sex unions . jenkins ' attorney , joseph price of the washington law firm arent fox , said friday 's ruling  just affirms the old principle that when these kinds of custody and visitation disputes begin in one state , that 's where they should remain .   you ca n't shop them around to another state ,  price said .  virginia really had no choice but to enforce judgments and judicial orders from vermont .  vermont is one of the few states that allow same-sex partners to enter into a civil union . two years after vermont recognized miller and jenkins ' relationship , miller gave birth to a daughter , isabella , conceived through artificial insemination . the relationship deteriorated , and miller and the baby moved to virginia . a vermont court later granted miller a dissolution of the civil union and granted custody of the child to her and visitation rights to jenkins . miller then asked the courts in virginia -- which does not recognize same-sex unions or marriages -- to take jurisdiction of the dispute . a virginia state judge eventually ruled that jenkins had no  parentage or visitation rights .  the virginia high court ruling friday returned the case to vermont 's control , meaning jenkins can visit the girl , who is now 6 . miller 's attorney , mathew staver , said he was  disappointed the state sidestepped the larger legal questions .   this case shows that one state is not an island in the same-sex marriage dispute , and underscores having state laws that protect traditional one-man , one-woman marriages ,  said staver , chairman of liberty counsel , a law firm that fights on behalf of what it calls  traditional families .  miller said in 2005 that she was doing what was best for her daughter and was no longer a lesbian .  i am isabella 's mom . i did conceive her ; i birthed her ,  she said .  i 'm raising her . and in my opinion , isabella needs to stay with me 100 percent of the time , because i am the only person that she identifies as a mom .  miller lives with isabella in winchester , virginia . jenkins did not offer an immediate reaction to the ruling but said in 2005 that she was only fighting for her rights as a parent .  justice will be served for isabella ,  she said .  i believe that . and i 'll do whatever it takes . i 'll be with her for as long as i can , or i 'll be without her for as long as i have to , but i 'm her mom .  she 's born here -lsb- in vermont -rsb- . she 's always here .  price said jenkins , who lives in fair haven , vermont , was supposed to visit isabella last weekend , but miller did n't appear with the girl . friday 's ruling comes a week after the california supreme court 's refusal to delay its recent decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the state . massachusetts also allows same-sex marriages ; vermont and three other states permit civil unions , and 12 other states give gay and lesbian couples some legal rights . virginia amended its constitution in 2007 to decree that marriage is defined as a union between one man and one woman .", "summary": "no summary"}
