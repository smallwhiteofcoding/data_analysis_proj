{"text": "dallas , texas if you turn to the bible -- isaiah chapter 35 , verse 8 -- you will see a passage that in part says ,  a highway shall be there , and a road , and it shall be called the highway of holiness .  churchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of interstate 35 . now , is it possible that this  highway  mentioned in chapter 35 is actually interstate 35 that runs through six u.s. states , from southern texas to northern minnesota ? some christians have faith that is indeed the case . it was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to texas , the southernmost state in the i-35 corridor , to do a story about a prayer campaign called  light the highway .  churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside interstate 35 , but the prayers are still continuing . some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of i-35 being the  holy  highway , it needs some intensive prayer first . so we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic christians prayed on the the interstate 's shoulder in dallas . they chanted loudly and vibrantly , making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on . they prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would  see the light  and perhaps close down . they prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate . they prayed that all americans would accept jesus into their lives . watch believers offer prayers  the woman who came up with the concept of  light the highway  is a texas minister named cindy jacobs . she says she ca n't be sure interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after  once again reading isaiah , chapter 35 .  jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history , such as the bridge collapse on i-35 in minneapolis last august and the assassination of jfk 44 years ago near i-35 in dallas . that 's why prayer certainly ca n't hurt , she adds . now , it 's only fair to say most people , the religious and the non-religious alike , do n't buy any of this , but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along i-35 . at an adult go-go club , the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others . and he says his club holds fundraisers , food drives and toy drives to help the community . but on the side of the road , the prayerful are n't going to change their minds . holy highways and nude clubs , they believe , are not a combination god has in mind . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
