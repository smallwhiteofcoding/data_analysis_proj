{"text": "washington responding to recent accidents linked to pilot fatigue , federal safety officials hope reduce airline pilots ' logging 14-hour days . the faa currently allows pilots to log 14-hour workdays , which the ntsb says contributes to accidents . the national transportation safety board concluded in a report out tuesday that pilot fatigue was a probable cause in a runway landing accident during bad weather in michigan last winter . there were no fatalities . the federal aviation administration currently allows a 14-hour workday with eight hours of logged airtime .  it 's a critical issue ; it 's an insidious issue . many times , the pilots themselves do n't even recognize that they are fatigued when they get into that cockpit ,  ntsb chairman mark rosenker said . and rosenker made the same points about air traffic controllers more than a year ago , in april 2007 . in a letter to the faa , rosenker said that four other plane incidents  provide clear and compelling evidence  that controllers are sometimes operating while fatigued because of their work schedules and poor use of rest periods .  that fatigue has contributed to controller errors ,  rosenker wrote in 2007 .  fourteen hours is still a very long day ,  ntsb board member debbie hersman said . her conclusion is backed by 40 years of airline accident statistics compiled by the faa and cited tuesday at an ntsb hearing .  after a duty period of about 10 to 12 hours , the number of observed accidents increased exponentially ,  ntsb staff member malcolm brenner said . in february , the cockpit crew of a passenger plane operated by mesa airlines failed to answer air traffic controllers for 18 minutes , missed the flight 's destination in hawaii and continued for another 15 miles at 21,000 feet over the pacific ocean . the investigation has shown that  both pilots unintentionally fell asleep during cruise flight ,  ntsb staff member jena price said during a presentation to the safety board . the crew of go ! flight 1002 eventually answered concerned calls on the radio from ground controllers , turned around and safely landed . the ntsb report called for analysis of sleep quantity , sleep quality , performance , errors and incidents traced to schedules that disrupt sleep patterns , perhaps while stretching workloads to the maximum allowed .  they can not just keep pushing pilots until they drop ,  said the head of the air line pilots association , rory kay . he said during a break in the ntsb hearing that  pilot pushing  is an issue .  we are in tough economic times , we 're being asked to do more with less , and we have to support the pilot when he makes the determination that it 's time to call it quits ,  he said . after reviewing some possible remedies against fatigue in the cockpit , board members unanimously approved the proposal to the faa , which would be responsible for developing guidance for the airlines to carry out . the faa plans to hold a symposium on fatigue management next week with representatives from the aviation industry .  i want the faa to have a complete overhaul of the flight time/duty time regulations  that presently allow a 14-hour day with eight hours of flight time , kay said .", "summary": "no summary"}
