{"text": "presidential candidates have been wooing voters in iowa for months , but who wins thursday may simply come down to where the caucus-goers live , where they meet and the weather . iowa is a mixed bag politically , and one of the most evenly divided states in the nation . but the candidates will likely watch two regions more closely than others . the central part of the state -- including industrial des moines -- is iowa 's most democratic area . western iowa , on the other hand , is home to the most republicans -- especially the rural counties in the northwest . the mississippi river city of davenport is expected to be one of the most significant battlegrounds , with linn county -- dominated by the university town of cedar rapids -- also attracting lots of attention from both parties . past iowa caucuses have been nail-biters for the candidates . democrat al gore won the state by a margin of just 0.3 percent in 2000 , while president bush carried it in 2004 by 0.7 percent . in fact , bush was the first gop presidential candidate to carry iowa in 20 years . important endorsement . the support of iowa 's largest newspaper , the des moines register , may also play a role in thursday 's caucuses . the paper 's presidential endorsements began in 1988 and have become a highly sought-after prize in iowa presidential politics . george w. bush was the register 's pick in 2000 and went on to win iowa , the gop nomination and the white house . republican presidential hopeful bob dole won the state in 1996 and 1988 after receiving the paper 's support . democratic candidates have n't had as much success with the register 's endorsement . john edwards finished in second place in iowa in 2004 , while paul simon was also a close second in 1988 . the paper endorsed sen. john mccain and sen. hillary clinton for their respective parties ' nominations . the candidates have to appeal to voters with strong opinions . on the republican side , 37 percent of participants in the 2000 iowa gop caucuses identified themselves as members of the religious right and 73 percent described themselves as conservatives . meanwhile , 56 percent of the participants in iowa 's 2004 democratic caucuses described themselves as either very or somewhat liberal . about 37 percent said they were moderates . the weather . iowans who take part in the caucuses must traditionally brave freezing temperatures and lots of snow . presidential candidates know bad weather may affect how many people turn out , but 1972 was the only time rough winter conditions played a role in the caucuses , according to drake university 's hugh winebrenner -- the nation 's leading expert on iowa caucus history . caucus-goers that year encountered heavy snowdrifts from a blizzard the previous day . temperatures dipped below zero across most of the state . the weather forced about one-fourth of iowa 's 99 counties to postpone their democratic caucuses up to two days after the scheduled date . the forecast for thursday is much better . temperatures will be in the 20s during the day and dip just below that as the caucuses begin , according to the des moines register . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
