{"text": "london , england record oil prices , the sub-prime mortgage mess and slumping stock markets are hardly music to the ears of investors . in tough economic times like these , investors seek out safe , stable investments such as guaranteed government bonds or cds . yet a growing number are being wooed by the sweet sounds , and profits , of something new -- investment funds specializing in high-end musical instruments . the stradivarius violin -- only about 700 are believed to exist -- is the premier investment instrument . talented musicians want them , but ca n't afford them -- one fetched $ 3.5 million at auction . enter nigel brown , winner of the queen 's award for enterprise and chairman of the nw brown group , a financial services company . he brings musician and investor together .  what happens is , a musician comes along to see me , having fallen in love with an instrument ,  brown says .  then , what i do is to pull a syndicate of people together to buy this instrument so that the musician can then have the use of it ...  down the road , the musician can buy the instrument from the investors . they split the profits if its value appreciates . that 's how violinist matthew trusler got his $ 2 million stradivarius . brown loved trusler 's playing and funded the instrument himself .  they are just the most fantastic violins that were ever made ,  trusler says , clutching his .  this one was made in 1711 ... and it 's been around for 300 years and it 's a really wonderful violin .  not everyone is convinced a stradivarius is such a great deal -- particularly modern instrument makers .  i think if you can get hold of one of the very best strads , not just any strad ... i think they probably give you , as a player , something special ,  says violin-maker andreas hudelmayer .  but if you ca n't have one of the very few best , you are just as well off with a new instrument .  his reasoning ? the cost of insuring a stradivarius for just a couple of years would pay for a new , top-quality violin , hudelmayer says . even so , the reality is that old violins are attracting those looking for alternative investments . a new hedge fund called the fine violins fund is dedicated to top-range instruments . the latest studies show exclusive violins are earning a steady 3.5 percent a year since 1850 . that beats u.s. treasury bonds over the same timeframe , with their 2.19 percent average yield . of course , you have to be in the investment game for the long haul .  they 've proved to be fantastic investments ,  says simon morris , director of beare 's -- a broker and appraiser of high-end violins , violas and cellos .  for many of the musicians that bought say in the 1960s , they 've been the best pension plan they could 've had .  like anything , you have to purchase well and sell well . you ca n't just go and buy any old thing .  but for these investors , the financial return is only part of the investment .  the fact they make a financial gain is of course gratifying at the end of the day , but it is mostly the support of the musician ,  says brown .  they like being able to go along to a concert and hear their instrument performed by their artist .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
