{"text": "los angeles , california -- one of the bigger difficulties any first-time buyer faces is purchasing a car that does n't scream  first-time  to friends , relatives and co-workers , or indeed to the buyer each time they step into an ill-chosen purchase . a  shark  that races down roads . to break from the boring econobox , here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $ 20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first-time owner . hyundai tiburon . if you did n't know already , tiburon means  shark  in spanish , and it 's not hard to see how hyundai 's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first-time buyer and snare them quickly . like an instantly recognizable dorsal fin , the tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low-slung sportster that wo n't bust a first-time buyer 's wallet , though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they 're pushed back into those tight-hugging bucket seats . the startling hyundai-designed looks boast a touch of italian styling uncommon for its bracket . mazda mazdaspeed3 . a bona-fide pocket rocket , any first-time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the mazdaspeed3 , part of the asian carmaker 's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from european carmakers . this one is n't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings , but do n't let any youngster tell you it does n't have what it takes to make their peers jealous . the mazdaspeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph . its secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood . another hidden gem is its seven-speaker bose stereo . pontiac g5 gt coupe . much like the fantastic chevy cobalt ss , its younger sister pontiac g5 gt boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first-time buyer 's wallet . the g5 gt has been tweaked just slightly from its sister ss -- like the difference between ashlee and jessica simpson -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance . both are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add-ons . a new grille entirely , like a phantom , may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd . the gt 's inline-four 2.4-liter 173-hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds . gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook . ford mustang v6 . a revamped chassis is the key to why ford 's mustang has become an outstanding product at a price that 's hard to beat . a tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer , craggier front end . some might of course call us heretics for picking a v6 over the famous eight-cylinder included in the gt package but , to be honest , the v6 performs admirably , pushes out 210hp and emits a low-down growl that sounds wonderful . and it 's still a mustang . civic coupe . a civic hatch was my second car -lrb- after a very short-lived vw rabbit -rrb- . the coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the civic 's surprisingly roomy front cabin , its enjoyable handling and maneuverability , first-class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end . standard features include a 350-watt premium sound system , a touch-screen satellite-navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the cd player , and a slot for a computer memory card . it 's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun . scion xb . on the heels of its 2004 release , toyota 's hipster scion brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year , this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company 's fj cruiser . wide rear pillars , wraparound headlights and bumper define the second-generation variant , which comes dripping with gadgetry inside , as well as leaving plenty of room for after-market customization . this one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort . other notable features include a central console that fits in a dvd player alongside a backlit gps sat-nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors . honda fit . a co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up saturn on a left turn into oncoming traffic . ouch . so it technically was n't her first car , but for many buyers , it will be . energetic , filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet , the fit looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect . you do n't get a third row of seats in there but , with the back row folded flat , it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper . other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear-seat headrests , while gas mileage is , as expected , very good indeed . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
