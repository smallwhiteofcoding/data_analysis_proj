{"text": "berlin , germany jeffrey jamaleldine took a bullet to his chin that blew out much of his jaw and nearly killed him while deployed in iraq last year . the sacrifice is just part of his job , he says , and he 'd go back to iraq in a second if asked . jeffrey jamaleldine left germany for college in america . in 2006 , he joined the u.s. army . that is something that troubles his family , especially his father . jamaleldine served in the u.s. army as a german citizen , one of an estimated 20,500  green-card warriors  in the military . last month , jamaleldine was awarded u.s. citizenship , but he 's keeping his german passport . bashir jamaleldine says his son is fighting an unjust war for an america that went too far when it invaded iraq five years ago -- a sentiment shared by the majority of germans . he wishes his son would get back to his  german roots .   it would satisfy me more . why he 's more american than a german , i do n't know ,  he says . of his son 's time in iraq , the father says ,  he went there to receive this bullet . if he would not have gone there , he would n't have been wounded ; he would n't be in the hospital ; he would n't be treated by a doctor . he would be living in peace with his family .  shaking his head with his son at his side , he adds ,  he is more american than german .  jeffrey jamaleldine , a 31-year-old u.s. army scout who proudly wears a stetson hat and spurs on his boots , laughs . he says he and his dad have had countless arguments over his decision to join the u.s. military , but the two never budge from their positions . see his shattered jaw and debate with his dad   he hears what i 'm saying , but there 's just no coming through ,  he says . the father came to germany from africa years ago . he says his son should be devoting his energy to fighting hunger and poverty in africa , not fighting in iraq . the son agrees with his father on one thing : his love for america is unwavering . jeffrey jamaleldine moved to the united states to go to college in missouri at the age of 18 and immediately fell in love with the united states and its culture .  you can go from rags to riches there . people still believe in that . it is not something that has gotten lost ,  he says . and when the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , happened , he felt it was time for him to do something .  a small group of people -lsb- terrorists -rsb- -- i felt -- had a big influence on our way of life and that literally pissed me off ,  he says . by accident , he says he found out that with his green card , he could join the u.s. military . and in 2006 , he did just that . read why a  green-card  marine would die for america . last year , he paid a heavy price for his patriotism . pinned down in a firefight with insurgents in the iraqi city of ramadi , jamaleldine was shot in the face .  i felt like i got hit by mike tyson ,  he says , pointing to a two-inch long scar on his left cheek . the left side his jaw was shattered and now doctors at landstuhl regional medical center in germany are reconstructing his facial bones .  part of the projectile is still stuck in the right cheekbone ,  dr. edward vanisky says .  but if it does n't cause you any problems , we 'll just leave it in there .  while many americans would consider jamaleldine a hero , most in his home country do n't . germans largely oppose the iraq war . the criticism does n't bother him . watch why a german would fight for u.s.  he says even after getting wounded on the battlefield , he would go fight for america again if ordered back to iraq .  i still do n't want to die , i love life , i enjoy life ,  he says .  but i would still make the sacrifice to go to iraq again if i am called . if i have to go , i will -- to stand up for what i believe in ,  he says . his father looks on in disbelief as he listens to his son , now an american citizen . but jeffrey jamaleldine says joining the military was never about that , it was about defending american ideals .  if we have people who want to change those ideals or take them away ,  he says ,  then there are people like me or my platoon who stand up and fight for those ideals .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
