{"text": "atlanta , georgia genarlow wilson , freed last week from a georgia prison , said he 's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors , even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier . genarlow wilson tells cnn on sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future . the 21-year-old , who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation , said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal . he had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day , he said sunday .  it might 've been lesser time , but then again , i would have nowhere to go because i would have no home ,  wilson said during a cnn interview scheduled to air monday at 8 p.m.  i would n't be able to stay with my mother because i have a little sister . you know , when you 're a sex offender you ca n't be around kids . basically , i ca n't even have kids myself , you know , so what is the point of life ?  he asked . in 2005 , a jury found wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 new year 's eve party . wilson was 17 at the time of the party . watch wilson say why he rejected the plea deal  the conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation . according to georgia attorney general thurbert baker , prosecutors in douglas county , georgia , offered wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record . defense attorney b.j. bernstein said in june that wilson rejected the deal because he did n't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence . the state legislature last year amended the law under which wilson was convicted , making such sexual encounters misdemeanors . however , the legislature did not make the law retroactive , so it had no effect on wilson 's sentence . now 21 , wilson was released friday after the state supreme court ruled 4-3 that the young man 's sentence  constitutes cruel and unusual punishment .  wilson said sunday he feels no  negative energy  toward district attorney david mcdade , who fought efforts to have wilson 's sentence reduced . instead , wilson said , he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies . he wants to major in sociology , he said ,  because i feel like i 've been living my major .  the new genarlow wilson will be more conservative , more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him , he said .  when it seems like you have everything , you know , you feel like you have no worries until it 's all gone , and i know what it feels like to be without and i do n't want to ever feel like that again ,  said the former honor student , football star and homecoming king .  i do n't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison , period .  though he called his sentence  absurd ,  wilson said he understands that prosecutors  were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law .  wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish .  i was young then . i did some idiotic things in my teen years , but you know , every average teen does ,  he said .  i do n't think any of us made very wise decisions , but i do n't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
