' and one ... asked whether she could go to cheerleading practice ,  he said . lipkins , the psychologist , says there 's a  disconnect between their actions and their thoughts .   they think the entire society is doing it , and they think it 's funny . so they put it on youtube . and i do n't think they expect kids to get really hurt , and they also do n't expect to get really caught .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's rich phillips contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
