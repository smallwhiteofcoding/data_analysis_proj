{"text": "chile called home its ambassador in peru on monday , as a dispute flared over disputed maritime territory between the south american neighbors . they have bickered over the rich pacific coast fishing waters for years , and peru published a new map on sunday that pushes its bid to negotiate a new sea border . chile 's government protested the move and said it was calling home its ambassador in peru , cristian barros , for consultations .  we feel that this type of publication -lrb- map -rrb- and this position certainly make more difficult a fluid bilateral relationship with the peruvian government ,  spokesman ricardo lagos weber said on monday .  chile will continue to fully exercise its rights and competencies over chilean territory ,  he said . peruvian president alan garcia said in june his country would take chile to the international court at the hague to resolve the case . peru 's foreign minister , jose antonio garcia belaunde , sought to downplay the row .  it is an absolutely common diplomatic practice in novel situations like this that garner attention that ambassadors are called -lrb- back to report -rrb- ,  he said .  the channels of dialogue and communication must be kept open , and the countries must work toward a positive agenda ,  garcia belaunde said . the sea border , set in the 1950s , starts close to the land border and cuts due west across the ocean . but peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles -lrb- 37,900 sq km -rrb- of fishing waters . its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the pacific ocean . analysts say peru will have its day in court and the hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved , unless something happens to escalate the debate .  the only thing that could happen , which would be very worrisome , would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty -lrb- in those waters -rrb- now that peru officially claims them . that would be a shame ,  said ricardo israel , a political analyst in chile . chile defeated peru in the 1879-1883 war of the pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor . the two countries have strong economic ties but relations are still rocky . the dispute over their sea border has bubbled anew over the past two years and comes in addition to less serious disputes over the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco , a grape liquor . peru and chile are the world 's top producers of fish meal , a cattle feed , and fishing is one of the engines of peru 's economy . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .", "summary": "no summary"}
