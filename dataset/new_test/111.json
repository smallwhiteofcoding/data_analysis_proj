{"text": "atlanta , georgia it is an irony of contemporary art-museum management : sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition does n't get to premiere it . in a treatment of a bridgeman art library photo , the high shows visitors jules arnout 's  view of the grand gallery .  this is the case this week , as atlanta 's high museum of art couples its public opening of a second year of louvre-fueled shows from paris , france , with an exhibition about influences on the impressionists .  inspiring impressionism  is organized by the denver art museum . it opened tuesday at the high , to run there through january 2008 . with the backing of northern trust , the show will then travel to denver february 23 to may 25 , 2008 , and then on to the seattle art museum from june 19 to september 21 , 2008 . why not start in denver ? that museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year louvre atlanta series of exhibitions . like priceless dominos falling , these shows roll around the country and the world , globalization dictating galas , super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners . see a gallery of images from ` inspiring impressionism ' at the high museum of art  another unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another . it should be interesting to learn whether showing  inspiring impressionism  at the high on the same time frame as the second year of louvre atlanta pays off . do all the boats in monet 's  autumn on the seine , argenteuil  float ? smart museum-goers will see it all .  the louvre and the ancient world  and the companion show  the eye of josephine ,  after all , look at some of the oldest treasures in the louvre 's vast holdings . see a gallery of some of the highlights of the louvre atlanta shows  the fit is comfortable , in a way , the impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in french artists . the emphasis here , however , is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as claude monet , pierre-auguste renoir and paul cézanne . one very distinctive connection from the louvre atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the louvre , bartolomé esteban murillo 's  the beggar boy  of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in western art 's modern history . from the outset , visitors to  inspiring impressionism  are reminded of the louvre treasures all around them at the high : the impressionism show 's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of louis jules arnout 's  view of the grand gallery at the louvre  from between 1850 and 1870 . in that original painting and color lithograph that followed , arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the louvre 's chief exhibition space that runs along the seine in paris . in fact , even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at louvre atlanta 's  the tiber  marble from the first century a.d. , you 're reminded that michelangelo himself was aware of that piece , influenced by it , presumably inspired by it . so a surprise symmetry takes shape at the high this fall , as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums -lrb- the louvre , the high , denver , seattle -rrb- , the viewers of art in europe and the united states , and the artists themselves in france , in the u.s. and elsewhere . high director michael shapiro calls these synchronicities  visual evidence of connections .  his colleagues timothy standring of denver and ann dumas of london , england , have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions , glimpses of old world craft from titian and velasquez to fragonard and rubens -- and the  moderns  who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate . do n't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists , used as part of the display of the show at the high . degas may have said it most honestly :  no art is less spontaneous than mine . what i do is the result of refection and the study of the old masters .  joining northern trust corporation in funding the exhibition are the national endowment for the humanities , and support is also provided by an indemnity from the federal council on the arts and the humanities . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
