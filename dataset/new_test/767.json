{"text": "a paris court has ordered ebay to pay $ 63 million damages to luxury goods company lvmh for allowing copies of its goods to be sold on the web auction site . louis vuitton took ebay to court for selling a range of fake luxury goods online . the fashion company -- home to brands including louis vuitton , givenchy , fendi , emilio pucci and marc jacobs -- complained it had been hurt by the sale of fake products on ebay . pierre godet , an adviser to lvmh chairman and ceo bernard arnault , said the court 's decision was  an answer to a particularly serious question , on whether the internet is a free-for-all for the most hateful , parasitic practices .  ebay said lvmh was trying to crack down on internet auctions because it was uncomfortable with its business model , which puts sellers rather than brands in control .  if counterfeits appear on our site , we take them down swiftly ,  ebay spokeswoman sravanthi agrawal said .  but today 's ruling is not about counterfeits . today 's ruling is about an attempt by lvmh to protect uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice and the livelihood of law-abiding sellers that ebay empowers every day .  she said ebay intended to appeal the ruling . the case pit two pillars of their industries -- one old , one new -- in a country whose courts often challenge internet companies on matters protected elsewhere by freedom of speech . the ruling faulted ebay for  guilty negligence  for not doing enough to prevent fake goods from being sold on its site . the court also ruled that ebay was responsible for the  illicit sale  of perfumes from the lvmh empire , which can be sold only through the brands '  selective distribution networks .  the court barred ebay from running ads for the perfume and cosmetic brands or face a fine of $ 79,000 per day . heather mcdonald , partner at law firm baker hostetler , said :  ebay has policies and procedures in place where they will intervene in an action between a buyer and seller if there 's a problem , and they profit directly on the basis of every item that is sold on their web site .  this gives them an affirmative obligation to take steps to make sure that illegal goods are n't sold , and they certainly have the ability to do that .  they have been able to make sure that you ca n't buy a handgun and they have been able to make sure that you can not buy pornography or prescription narcotics or other medicines on ebay .  they have the ability to do this , they have just chosen not do and to rest the entire burden of policing ebay on the shoulders of the trademark and copyright holders whose rights are being infringed here .
