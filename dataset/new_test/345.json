{"text": "editor 's note : in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . here , cnn 's arwa damon describes the hardships faced by iraqi women . her documentary airs this weekend on cnn and cnn international . nahla 's husband returned to iraq after the fall of saddam hussein . he was killed in a bomb blast in 2007 . baghdad , iraq the pain here is choking -- it 's a dark , suffocating sorrow .  they took my husband away in front of me . i found his body in the morgue a few days later . he had multiple bullet wounds and his eyes had been gouged out ,  one woman tells me , forcefully twisting a tissue in her hands as if it somehow could ease her agony and erase the chilling memory . she did n't want her story told , too afraid that she would meet the same fate as the man she loved . her husband 's body bore the  signs of torture .  how many times has that phrase been used ? it 's such a common phrase it 's as if what really happened gets glossed over : skin scraped off their bodies , fingernails ripped out , horrifying screams of pain before death . how many times have we reported death tolls from one horrific bombing or another and not been able to get across that these are lives that literally were blown apart ? no matter how hard we in the media try , iraq remains a nation filled with untold tragedies , the scope of which so often is overwhelming . and no matter how hard iraqis try to shield themselves and those they love from the horrors here , more often than not they fail . yet they keep fighting . see the sacrifices of iraq 's women  nahla works at a radio station and is one of those women . she 's tall , slender , elegantly dressed and has a firm handshake . i look at her and it 's nearly impossible to imagine what she 's been through .  this numbers game , you always think that you are exempt from the numbers ,  nahla tells me , referring to the daily death toll .  you 're pained by them , but you are outside of them .  watch nahla 's struggle to live on  on april 14 , 2007 , her world shattered . there was an explosion on a bridge in the capital and 10 people were killed . her husband , mohammed , was one of them .  and with it , i am motionless ,  she says .  truly , life was in color and now it is in black and white . i feel like it is a game of musical chairs we used to play with others . ... one time you are hit with the chair ; another time , someone else is . now , my son and i are out of the game completely , completely .  the image of the man she loved , tall and proud , is of a doctor who moved his family back to iraq after the fall of saddam hussein because he believed his country needed him . he was a father who doted on their 6-year-old autistic son . also etched into her memory is the image of his charred body , melted together with nine others , a twisted pile of black , scorched flesh . yet nahla 's voice is calm as she speaks , only breaking at the very end of our conversation , when the pain , buried so deep , rises to the surface . she could n't suppress her gut-wrenching dry sobs . i do n't know how many times i have heard stories like hers after nearly five years of war here , and yet i still get chills . i ca n't stop being in awe -- nor can i stop looking at these women in amazement . life in iraq has forced people to confront horror that would leave many of us paralyzed . watch a divorcee forced to live amid squalor with her kids  where do they find the strength to keep going ? some do n't and choose to live out their lives as hollow shells , just waiting for this wretched existence to be over . but so many others refuse to be beaten down , refuse to allow the horror that is iraq to win and kill their spirit .  if i want to see baghdad again from before the war , i have to do my part while the other person will do his part and the other person will do his part ,  says dr. eaman , a children 's doctor , as her bright smile seems to shine unnaturally in baghdad 's grim atmosphere .  this is the dream , and i wish everybody would believe it and it will happen , i 'm sure , and this is what is keeping me here ,  she continues .  i have been attacked by three insurgents and was going to be kidnapped .  she now lives at the hospital , choosing to disassociate herself from her 8-year-old son to keep him safe . watch why  i must help my people    i wish i can have him with me , live with me , you know , raising him , and just show him how to do things more than anything else ,  eaman says as she laughs and apologizes for her tears . she knows she chose to live with that pain because she believes other children need her more .  iraq is my life , is my country . being a woman and knowing what other -lsb- countries -rsb- look like , i want to make a change . i want to make a change for the future for a lot of people .  yanar is another fighter , petite with curly dark hair and a commanding presence .  you have been beaten , pushed , kicked and blindfolded ,  yanar says , describing today 's iraqi woman .  you can not see , you can not hear , but you are kicking back . it 's not ok to be like that . you kick back and you fight for what you deserve ... you should not be turned into a prisoner .  she started the organization for women 's freedom in iraq to act as a watchdog to help safeguard women 's rights amid war and conflict . she is another woman who exhibits jaw-dropping courage . go inside iraq with cnn 's arwa damon  she left her family and her comfortable life in canada and came to baghdad to build growing support for women 's rights . she lives a life that at times sounds more like a james bond movie -- having to constantly move because of death threats -- than that of a mother of a 9-year-old .  at many stages i had to change my house so my address is a secret ; nobody knows where i am other than 10 very close allies ,  yanar says nonchalantly , as if what she is saying is completely normal . but in iraq it is -- it 's a country where a person 's parameters of what they accept as being  normal  have to shift to survive .  what brings me here ,  yanar says ,  it is that everybody that i love , all the people that i love have been crushed .  she adds ,  this can not happen , should not happen , can not be allowed to happen .  what we as journalists can not allow to happen is for these voices to go unheard . no matter how hard it is for us to find them -- literally navigating roadblocks and checkpoints or spending days chasing down someone -- the voices of the innocents caught in war must be heard . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
