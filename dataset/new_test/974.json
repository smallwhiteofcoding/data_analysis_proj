{"text": "tilcara , argentina carmen salva 's mission may be ambitious , but her belief is simple :  it 's never too early to start caring for the land you live in and grow up in .  carmen salva :  it 's a great joy to know that i am preparing a new generation to respect the environment .  that 's why on saturdays , salva and a group of 60 to 100 students , parents and teachers can be found venturing into the high altitude of their northern argentina mountains , trash bags in hand and llamas in tow . they 're part of esperanza de vida -lrb- hope for life -rrb- , salva 's youth environmental group that is out to clean up the surroundings , one plastic bottle at a time . salva , 49 , was born and raised in the jujuy province of northern argentina , an area known for its rich culture and spectacular vistas --  the reason why most people fall in love with it ,  says salva . but despite its beauty , salva says there 's no real environmental consciousness in her community .  we have a lot of issues to work on -- the problem of water contamination ; there 's so much trash ,  salva says .  we ca n't just think that it will take care of itself .  salva , who has been a teacher in jujuy for 20 years , says the environmental issues are n't recent ones . ten years ago , she and her students noticed a lot of trash outside the school .  the parks surrounding the school were littered with plastic bottles and beer bottles ,  recalls salva . they began volunteering with a government program , collecting and bagging waste in the area . but the program waned after a year , and students and teachers could no longer continue their environmental efforts .  our city had no formal recycling program or even knowledge of why it was important to learn about fresh water , forestation , and the importance of recycling ,  says salva . so salva began esperanza de vida in 1997 to organize and lead young participants in  making our streets and our environment cleaner .   i believe that change begins with the youth ,  says salva .  they will teach future generations how to care for nature and everything that surrounds us .  at first , the group 's activities were limited to cleaning parks near and around the school . but the organization 's efforts have expanded well beyond the immediate area , and other jujuy schools have joined in . about 150 people now take part , including about 80 children . salva says her students are deeply impacted by the  pachamama  concept , or caring for mother earth . she and fellow teachers have noticed their students apply as much energy and commitment to the weekend environmental activities as they do to their general subjects .  some even wait by my house on saturday for the program to begin ,  beams salva . the group convenes early in the morning to hike together into the mountains , where they work for hours , picking up trash and separating recyclables . watch salva talk about her program 's impact on the students and their environment   we have long days and we accomplish a lot . it gets tiring because it 's a lot of walking and sometimes there are cliffs ,  says salva .  -lsb- but -rsb- the students enjoy it a lot . they 're making changes while having fun .  on an average saturday cleanup , it 's not unusual for the group to collect roughly 60 bags of trash for recycling , clearing thousands of bottles from the mountains . the llamas help carry the heavy load down from the mountains .  the children call them the little eco-llamas .  watch salva discuss another way the llamas help her group in the mountains  the local government has also pitched in , helping to provide transport of the collected recyclables to the drop-off center , located nearly 50 miles from tilcara . salva says the group is making strides , raising awareness throughout her community , continually adding new volunteers , and implementing new projects . carmen says the children are even teaching their parents to care for the environment around them . watch salva and her group in action in the mountains   it 's a great joy to know that i am preparing a new generation to respect the environment ,  says salva .  their children 's children will have another mentality , and -lsb- our -rsb- goal will be accomplished .
