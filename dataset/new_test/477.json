{"text": "china 's giant pandas are believed to be safe after monday 's earthquake , but concern is growing over how they will get their next meals . the giant pandas ' primary food source is bamboo . authorities confirmed tuesday that captive animals in two of china 's major panda reserves were alive , according to xinhua , china 's official news agency . the wolong giant panda reserve center in southwest sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas , who were reported safe tuesday . staff and critters at neighboring chengdu panda breeding and research center were also reported safe , according to a spokesperson for the atlanta zoo , which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve . concern arose in the international wildlife community over damage to the animals ' habitat , as authorities continued assessing the scope of damage in the sichuan province . the mountainous , densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild , making it an obvious location for research bases like wolong and chengdu . giant pandas roam the forest in  open cages  that are meant to provide them with a safe , natural environment that will prepare them for release . with the safety of the pandas confirmed , the animals ' caregivers are left to determine how resources like food and medical supplies will reach the bases , which contain breeding facilities and triage centers . bamboo , the pandas ' primary source of food , is a major agricultural product in the region , but whether it can be supplied to the pandas despite infrastructure damage is open to question .  wolong is hard to access under normal conditions , so the heavy road damage makes it even harder ,  said kerry zobor , spokesperson for the world wildlife fund . zobor said wwf had confirmed the safety of staff based in beijing , but had not received word on the conditions in wolong . she said the wwf was also concerned about members who had been touring the country when the earthquake struck . so far , the group has not been located . scientists in the united states are hopeful that chinese researchers will adapt to the situation facing them . david wildt with the smithsonian 's national zoological park in washington says that scientists in wolong have overcome threats to the giant panda population before . in the late 1990s , the captive giant panda population was in decline , with more animals dying than were born , wildt said . thanks to a collaborative effort with american scientists , the wolong staff was able to reverse the trend .  our chinese colleagues are very perceptive when it comes to addressing problems ,  said wildt , who has visited wolong many times as part of the smithsonian 's affiliation with the research base .  because of their efforts , the population is on the rise today .  wildt said that chinese scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources before .  artificial diets in the form of protein biscuits have been created for giant pandas . they 're not a complete substitute , but they meet the needs of a basic high-fiber diet ,  said wildt , who has worked with two pandas that the smithsonian has on loan from wolong .  right now , we 're mostly concerned about the staff . if the staff is fine , then the animals will be fine ,  wildt said .", "summary": "no summary"}
