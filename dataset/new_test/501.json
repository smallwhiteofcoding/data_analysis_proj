{"text": "he 's been described as the richard branson of asian airlines . and he certainly knows a thing or two about building a brand . tony fernandes , ceo of air asia , spoke to cnn 's andrew stevens in the boardroom . in just five years , tony fernandes has built air asia from a bankrupt local carrier to the region 's biggest budget airline -- 18 million passengers will fly the airline this year . cnn 's andrew stevens talked to fernandes in macau to find out why , at the age of 37 , he would leave a comfortable job in the music industry to start a new business in the cut-throat , not to mention high risk , aviation industry . fernandes : well there 's a fine line between brilliance and stupidity , so the second point in a statement that richard branson 's made is how to become a millionaire , start with a billion and start an airline . now i was the other way around , i did n't have a billion . so i think that was one of the things , that i did n't have a lot to lose . and i thought i was young enough . i got tired of the corporate life , i got tired of corporate politics . and i saw a business opportunity . everyone likes to fly . and i think the key number that got me going was only six percent of malaysians flew . i started looking at the prices of tickets , and to travel from one part of malaysia to another it was almost someone 's one month salary . so that drove me . but i did n't want to be there , you know , at 55 , and say i should 've done it . life is about risks , life is about not being afraid to fail . stevens : but at the time , airlines were going into bankruptcy , oil prices were going through the roof , people were too scared to fly globally , did n't you think ,  oh my god i 've made the worse decision of my life ?  fernandes : no , i knew malaysians very well . you put a price low enough , they 'd risk their lives . i think also when you start a business the most important thing is does the market want it . and i knew the market wanted it . if that 's there , everything is surmountable because people power is strong . stevens : you like to pluck people from all different walks of life , from all different professions . how do you meld them all together ? what 's the philosophy underlying this ? fernandes : well i think , first is that everyone plays a part . there is no hierarchy . everyone is valuable . i make all my senior management carry bags and things so they appreciate that . stevens : do they ? fernandes : oh yes , they do . some try to shirk their duties , but it 's very hard when they see the ceo doing it -- they have to do it . the second is that everyone 's got ability , it 's how you bring the best out of them . and that 's a very motivating thing . if you see someone who 's carrying a bag suddenly flying a plane . that 's a very powerful motivator . you can do all the theory and books and promise people the world but when they see it in reality , boy that 's a powerful thing to see . stevens : when air asia started , you were known to go down , roll up your sleeves , and really get in with your staff at all levels , do you still have time to do that ? fernandes : i have less time , but i still do it . i think it 's fundamental to running my company , because , unless you get down to the floor and see what 's happening , you wo n't make effective decisions . i do it for two reasons . one is , to see what 's going on , and to make sure if i 'm making the right decisions . and the second thing is , i still want to discover these raw diamonds . stevens : what 's the best piece of business advice you 've ever been given ? fernandes : focus and discipline . stay focused and disciplined . stick to a plan , stick to a vision . you change but the vision 's still the same . and that came from conor mccarthy of ryanair . he has taught me about discipline and focus and i think that 's been a really good lesson for me . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
