{"text": "new york a massive anti-mafia sweep that stretched from new york to sicily has not only cut off the head of the gambino crime family but lopped off  the shoulders and chest  too , prosecutors said thursday . john  jackie the nose  d'amico , shown in 1992 , is one of 62 people indicted . sixty-two members of the gambino , genovese and bonanno families face 80 charges , ranging from money laundering to illegal gambling and murder .  these charges strike at the very core of the gambino family ,  said benton campbell , united states attorney for the eastern district of new york . the gambino family profited from extortion within the new york construction industry and its labor unions , according to the charges . watch the perp walk  several companies allegedly paid a  mob tax  in return for  protection  and  permission to operate ,  said gordon heddell , inspector general of the u.s. department of labor . other charges involve an alleged illegal gambling ring , said richard brown , queens county district attorney . nicholas corozzo -- a reputed captain in the gambino family -- was involved in a sports gambling enterprise that relied in part on toll-free telephones , brown alleged . meanwhile , four members of the gambino family are charged with eight crimes involving murder , according to the indictment . those charges include the felony murder of jose delgado rivera , who was shot and killed in an armored truck during a robbery in 1990 .  today we are able to bring closure to crimes from the past that have never been forgotten ,  campbell said . he said the crimes span back over three decades . watch feds say they 've ` cut off the head ' of crime family  key to the gambino arrests thursday was a member of the attorney general 's organized crime task force who infiltrated the gambino family and recorded hundred of hours of conversations , said john milgrim , a spokesman for the attorney general . forty-five of those charged are already in custody , police said . arrests were made in new york city ; long island , new york ; and new jersey .  it is as unrelenting as weeds that continue to sprout in the cracks of society ,  new york attorney general andrew cuomo said of organized crime .  we will not rest until organized crime is a distant memory .  in addition to the arrests in the new york area , police in italy detained 77 people in connection with organized crime . those arrests netted important members of a powerful clan in sicily linked to mafia boss salvatore lo piccolo , who was believed to be the successor of the boss of bosses , bernardo provenzano . watch the prosecutor explain why authorities acted now  police say that in his attempt to rise to power , le piccolo tried to mend fences with new york-based mafia families after those ties were broken during the bloody mafia wars of the 1980s . those families included the gambinos of new york and the inzerillos of italy . provenzano was arrested two years ago in corleone .  it is evident that the intent of the mafia in palermo was to re-establish a dialogue through the inzerillo family in the u.s ,  francesco messineo of the italian police said .  a dialogue that was never interrupted because the relationship between the american and the italian mafia is historic , based on long tradition . but there was certainly an attempt to re-establish that connection .  investigators believe mob clans wanted to collaborate on illegal commercial ventures such as money laundering and drug trafficking . italian officials said the arrests were aimed at preventing these illegal activities , but they warned that other mafia clans in sicily oppose the return of the inzerillo family to the island , and therefore were concerned about a new mafia war . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's deborah feyerick and alessio vinci contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
