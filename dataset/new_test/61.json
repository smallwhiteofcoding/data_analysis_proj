{"text": "a hit tv show . an emmy . a summer blockbuster . a new company . a wedding ! katherine heigl has every reason to smile for our camera . a star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born . the ingénue :  this is my favorite look of the three just because it 's sexy but not overtly so ,  heigl says .  i like simple hair and makeup .  there has been a self-tanning mishap . as katherine heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the roosevelt golf course at griffith park in los angeles , she walks stiffly , holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late . earlier , she 'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner , which refused to dry . she resorted to having her fiancé , musician josh kelley , take a blow-dryer to her -lrb- did n't work -rrb- . so here she is , in a strapless , ankle-length juicy couture sundress -lrb- donned to accommodate the residual stickiness -rrb- , fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when -lrb- or if -rrb- the lotion ever sets . not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products .  i love everything new ,  says heigl , 28 , who , in addition to being nominated for an emmy for best supporting actress on  grey 's anatomy ,  just started a production company at fox .  when i was in rhode island filming this summer , i went to sephora for the first time . it was like my holy mecca .  she recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot . then there 's her deal with coty to be the face of nautica 's new women 's fragrance in january . considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as heigl 's impressive acting range -- she plays tv dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy , as in the mega-hit  knocked up  and next year 's 27 dresses -- it seems natural for her to be in style 's first ever triple-cover girl . these three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp . the star , whom pals call katie -lrb- and hollywood calls the next big thing -rrb- , popped out her retainer to talk about makeup , breakouts and what boys like . katherine heigl : i 'm so sorry , i have to take out my invisalign before i eat . in style : who knew you wore them ? i guess that 's the point of invisalign . kh : i got them because of this wonky tooth . i was like , ok , i ca n't take it . it 's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer . pretty much the perfect way to describe invisalign is netflix for your teeth . is : right -- the things we do for beauty . so , how did you like being transformed into three such different looks ? kh : it was fun . i was working with such great hair and makeup people . and to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat . is : do you ever go without makeup ? kh : there was a time when i would . now that i get followed by photographers , i 'm really paranoid about it . i do not want to be the  look what this celebrity looks like without makeup  picture . i 'm clearly vain , and i do n't need that . plus , i like products . is : how often do you go through your drawers and purge ? kh : often , because people send me a lot of stuff now , which is exciting . i love getting those boxes . -lsb- into the tape recorder :] send me a box of makeup , stila ! when that happens , i feel like i have to clean out and give stuff to my sister , mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that i ca n't accept . is : how do you think you express your personality through style ? kh : i 'm a big hair-up person . last night at work they put my hair in two french braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap . i thought it looked cute and that i could pull it off after i 'd slept on it . and ... no . so i thought i could recreate it myself ... no again . as far as clothing style goes , i fluctuate almost as much as i do with beauty products . i like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it 's the new englander in me . i 'm building a house in the mountains in utah , so i tell myself i 'm  preparing  for that . i like sweaters -- they 're like scrubs -- you do n't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat . is : do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding ? kh : i have an idea , but it 's so dependent on the dress , and i have n't gotten there yet . my sister is getting married too , so we looked for dresses together . after about five stores i was like ,  i 'm done .  everyone says ,  you just know when you put that dress on .  my sister found the right dress just like that . so i know it can happen . but it 's grueling . is : wait , so your mom has two daughters getting married within months ? kh : my poor mother is probably like ,  why , god ? why ?  but i hired a planner . i want the day to be spectacular , but mostly i want it to be fun . and i do n't want to freak out or stress . is : does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look ? kh : josh would n't mind if my hair was brown , if it was still long -- that 's such a boy thing . is : would you ever wear a wig out ? kh : i 'd contemplate it , but i do n't know if i actually have the courage to pull it off . i once wore a long hair-extension ponytail , and someone asked me if it was real , like i was one of those dolls when we were little , and the hair just cranks out . is : how would you describe your skin ? kh : my skin is sensitive , so everything bothers it . and i 'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse . is : how do you treat a breakout ? kh : i got a great product at ona spa called sebuspot . i 've tried so many that were disappointments , but maybe i stand too close to the mirror examining my pores . if i backed up , things might look fine . is : what do you always carry in your bag ? kh : powder , because i get shiny . and lip balm , either the smith 's rosebud salve or c.o. bigelow 's mentha lip shine in black cherry soda from bath & body works . it 's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good . is : an in style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in hollywood . kh : i train with harley pasternak . i love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-factor diet . i first said ,  i 'm never going to be -- nor do i want to be -- an uber-athletic girl .  it 's just not me and i do n't have that kind of discipline . he said ,  i just want you to be healthy .  a lot of what we focus on is posture . i slump into myself when i get stressed . if i were going to play an action hero , i 'd have to get that look . but i 'd never maintain it . for me it 's never about achieving a look that 's impossible . e-mail to a friend . get a free trial issue of instyle - click here ! copyright © 2007 time inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
