{"text": "washington president bush on wednesday signed a sweeping energy bill that he said would help the country become  stronger , cleaner and more secure .  president bush on wednesday signs a bill raising auto fuel economy standards for the first time in decades . the bill -- approved overwhelmingly tuesday by the house of representatives -- raises automotive fuel economy standards for the first time in more than three decades , requiring a corporate average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020 . it also boosts federal support for alternative fuel research and energy conservation efforts . a republican filibuster in the senate removed provisions that bush objected to that would have eliminated tax breaks for oil companies and a requirement that electric utilities produce a portion of their power from alternative sources . the current fuel-economy standards of 27.5 miles per gallon for passenger cars and 22.2 for light trucks were established in 1975 . the new bill sets a single average standard for manufacturers . senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said tuesday 's bill was  a great , wonderful first step for an energy revolution that starts in america and ripples throughout the world .  but reid said democrats would continue pushing to shift federal tax breaks away from fossil-fuel producers and into renewable energy research -- one of the party 's top priorities when it took control of congress in january . house opponents such as rep. joe barton , r-texas , complained that the bill will undo many of the efforts made to foster increased production of fossil fuels in an energy bill passed in 2005 .  i understand the consequences of elections . i understand there 's a new majority ,  said barton , the ranking republican on the house committee on energy and commerce .  i do not understand how what made sense two years ago does n't make sense today .  barton called the legislation a  no-energy  bill and  a recipe for recession ,  arguing its mandated conservation measures would raise prices for fuel , homes and appliances for consumers . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ed henry contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
