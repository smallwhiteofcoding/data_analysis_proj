{"text": "atlanta , georgia it 's midnight on the streets of atlanta , and bar owner rufus terrill patrols his neighborhood with a rolling crime fighter of his own creation . meet  bum-bot ,  as terrill describes it ; others in his neighborhood call it simply ,  robocop .  this former bbq smoker is armed with a water gun to chase off bums and drug dealers in downtown atlanta . it 's a barbecue smoker mounted on a three-wheeled scooter , and armed with an infrared camera , spotlight , loudspeaker and aluminum water cannon that shoots a stream of icy water about 20 feet . operated by remote control , the robot spotlights trespassers on property down the street from his bar , o'terrill 's . using a walkie-talkie , terrill belts out through the robot 's loudspeaker ,  that 's private property . you guys need to get out of here .  terrill is chasing out unsavory-looking characters from a street corner that resembles a drug dealer 's dream at night . more than 20 suspicious people were seen huddling in the dark in the front driveway and side parking lot on this night . some were seen openly making drug deals . watch  bum-bot  in action  but during the day , it 's where young children frolic on a nearby playground at a the beacon of light daycare center in downtown atlanta . it has become a nightmare for day care operator lydia meredith .  this whole square is enveloped with homeless people and drug dealers , defecating , urinating , prostituting -- the whole nine yards . and the overflow of that behavior , we get to cleanup every morning ,  she says . meredith says people often toss used syringes and condoms onto the playground . terrill , an engineer by trade , is also a board member at the day care center . tired of cleaning up after the shady characters , he decided to take action . that 's when he built his downtown darth vader of sorts .  he 's a neighborhood vigilante ,  says meredith ,  and when he came up with this -- you know , i call it robocop -- i said , ` praise god . '  the daycare center is a block from a homeless shelter . meredith has a security guard at the center who leaves in the early evening .  they know when the guard leaves ,  she says .  they know when the cleaning crew leaves and then here comes the drug dealers to prey on the homeless people .  anita beatty , the director of the shelter , is suspicious of the barbecue-smoker robot .  i just think the whole ` robocop ' spraying people is a little freaky . we really need some police protection in this neighborhood . i think it 's confusing the issue . i think the issue is homeless people . they are being confused with the folks who prey on them and sell them drugs ,  she says . atlanta police patrol the area , but say it 's difficult to stay on top of the large number of people who roam the streets in the area late at night . police major lane hagin says the robot is definitely a different crime-fighting idea .  there 's no problem with the robot going up and down the street or being visible or any of the other things it does -- with the exception of spraying water on people .  hagin adds ,  then , it becomes an assault no matter where it happens .  so far no one has filed charges against terrill or the robot . but one homeless man who declined to give his name followed terrill and his robot down the street and laughingly told him ,  i know about you . i can sue you for assault .  terrill says he 's not hurting anyone and often sprays the water to the side of loiterers as a ploy to get them to move on . he 's also not about to back down .  if you 're throwing condoms out on the side of the playground , if you 're throwing needles , you 're throwing crack pipes out there , i 'm not going to let those kids be out there like that . i 'm going to stop you .  terrill bought his bar four years ago knowing nothing about the restaurant business . he ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of georgia in 2006 . he 's had ongoing problems with people breaking into his bar and stealing things , but it was the day care center problems that spurred him on to create the robot . some of terrill 's bar patrons say they 've seen a difference in the neighborhood . susanne coe lives nearit does scare people and to be honest with you i 'm grateful for it ,  she says . on this night , as terrill and his robot make their way to the street corner , he shines the robot 's spotlight on the parking lot of the daycare center . one by one , the shadowy figures stand up , walk away and saunter down the street .  ninety-nine percent of the time , when i go up there and once i turn the spotlight on and i talk to them through the speaker , they leave ,  he says . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
