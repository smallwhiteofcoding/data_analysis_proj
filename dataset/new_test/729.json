makeshift levee as rising floodwaters threatened . residents of gladstone , illinois , work with the national guard to create a makeshift levee .  i 'm not moving , not moving my business ,  said byron sebastian , a longtime resident of gladstone , illinois , who also serves on the city council .  we 've got a lot of good people here helping to try to save this part of town .  gladstone is one of many towns under threat tuesday after rising waters breached a 300-foot area of a levee near gulf port , illinois , before 5 a.m. levees all along the mid-mississippi were being topped with sandbags tuesday as the river , fed by its flooded tributaries , continued to rise . illinois gov. rod blagojevich called up 1,100 national guard members to assist in sandbagging efforts , said patti thompson of the illinois emergency management agency . she also said inmates are helping on the levees and others are bagging sand in correctional institutions .  we were very , very disappointed that this levee broke today ,  said thompson .  it 's a very powerful river , and it can be hard to harness .  with the help of the national guard , sebastian and his fellow residents hustled tuesday to build a barrier between gladstone and the encroaching floodwaters . even though gladstone is about four miles from the banks of the mississippi , the rising floodwaters have submerged homes and created rivers where crop fields once stood . the muddy townspeople worked with anxious resolve , cracking the occasional joke , as they filled bags with sand and dirt and loaded them onto atvs . on the receiving end were members of the illinois national guard , who piled up the sandbags as the tops of cornstalks rose above the waters behind them .  threats can happen in all shapes and forms , so we are trying to help out ,  said national guardsman capt. lanny finn , whose unit previously served in iraq .  we 'll be here for as long as we 're needed .  sebastian , who lived through floods in

county , illinois , said water was  very , very close  to the top of some areas of the county 's two levees .  we 've had to evacuate some areas already , but the areas that have not been evacuated yet , we 're just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping that the levee will hold ,  he said . in two of the county 's communities , rio vista and pontoosuc , power has been shut off in all but 20 residences , a spokeswoman for the sheriff 's office said . missouri also began to feel the force of the surging mississippi tuesday , as water began to top multiple levees east of highway 79 ,

administrator for the iowa homeland security and emergency management division .  the bad news is we 're still in a flood fight .  president bush said he and a team will travel to iowa this week .
