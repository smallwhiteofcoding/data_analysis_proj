{"text": "yellowstone national park , montana the gray wolf was officially removed from the endangered species act 's  threatened  list friday after three decades -- a decision that has stoked controversy among environmentalists and ranchers . federal officials estimate there are 1,500 gray wolves in yellowstone national park . it means the wolves can be shot and killed once they step out of yellowstone national park as soon as the affected states establish a hunting season . however , state fish and wildlife officials can shoot the animals whenever they deem the wolves to be a problem . the government delisted the wolves -- which were eliminated from yellowstone decades ago before being reintroduced in the 1990s -- because they are now thriving in the park that is dominated by bison , elk and bighorn sheep .  they 're back here in the northern rockies ; they 're back here in yellowstone ,  said doug smith , a biologist for the national park service in yellowstone .  that 's something to celebrate given their history of human hatred .  but not everyone is happy about the animal being removed from the endangered list . conservationists believe hundreds of gray wolves straying from yellowstone in search of prey could soon be killed by hunters and ranchers . watch rancher say no wolf is  sacred    we 're not ready to pop the champagne corks and have a party ,  said doug honnold , the managing attorney for earthjustice , a non-profit environmental law firm based in oakland , california , that has threatened to sue the government .  my biggest fear is we 're going to go backwards instead of forwards .  it would n't be the first time . in the early 20th century , wolves were the targets of a massive government extermination campaign .  it 's harder to find an animal more persecuted than wolves . ... we did wolf extermination with a vengeance ,  said smith . but attitudes began to change in the 1980s . elk and bison populations increased dramatically because there was no natural predator to keep their numbers in check . in 1995 , smith led a team to bring wolves back to the rocky mountain landscape . they transplanted dozens of wolves to yellowstone from canada . see photos of yellowstone 's animals  the project has been regarded as an overwhelming success . there are now more than 1,500 wolves across wyoming , idaho and montana , according to the government . that number convinced federal wildlife officials to remove them from the endangered species list . federal officials require each of the three states to maintain a population of 100 wolves , meaning a total of 300 wolves across all three states . the states have actually pledged to keep the population higher than that , at a rate of 150 wolves per state .  we did a thorough analysis ,  said ed bangs , the wolf recovery coordinator for the u.s. fish and wildlife service .  the consensus -lsb- for recovery -rsb- is a population of 300 wolves and 30 breeding pairs .  he added ,  the wolf population is fully recovered . we have more wolves than we ever predicted and we have fewer problems than we ever predicted .  earthjustice says that 's not nearly enough to ensure a viable population and they want to stop the delisting .  we 're going to have hundreds of wolves die needlessly ,  said honnold . but many ranchers in the region just do n't understand the fuss about the animals . they have complained for years that the wolves eat their livestock .  there 's nothing about a wolf that 's sacred ,  said bruce malcolm , a cattle rancher and republican member of montana 's house of representatives . he said he 's lost nearly two dozen cows to the wolves in recent years .  i would have preferred that they never came here ,  he said . if there 's a winner with the controversy , it 's yellowstone . the wolves have pushed up attendance by more than a 100,000 visitors per year , according to a park study . smith , who has dedicated his life to the wolves , is philosophical about the debate .  no one says living with wolves is easy ,  said smith .  living with wolves is a compromise .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
