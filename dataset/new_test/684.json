{"text": "the world 's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of the human impact on the environment , the world wildlife fund said friday . these two adult frilled-neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in australia . the wwf 's latest living planet index shows terrestrial , freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005 , with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop . the index is included in a report called  2010 and beyond : rising to the biodiversity challenge ,  which the wwf prepared for an international biodiversity conference in germany later this month .  no one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines , greater vulnerability to natural disasters , and greater effects from global warming ,  said james leape , director-general of wwf international . the living planet index measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species , which the wwf says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends . terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35-year period , the wwf said . marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period , with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005 , the wwf said .  many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence , and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world 's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched ,  the wwf report said . freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003 . the wwf said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet , inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species . in tropical regions , freshwater species were especially hard-hit ; the index shows they suffered a 35-percent drop between 1970 and 2000 . the wwf said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003 . the causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere , such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems , the wwf said . the dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species ' capacity to replace itself , the wwf said . overfishing is one example . overexploitation is also a threat to terrestrial species , according to the report , which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals . overharvesting of timber is also a major factor , it said . invasive species , whether introduced deliberately or not , are another threat , especially in freshwater ecosystems , where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species , the wwf said . pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity , it said . the wwf called on governments attending this month 's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010 . it wants governments to establish protected areas , particularly those areas important for food security , water supply , medicine , and disaster mitigation , and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020 .", "summary": "no summary"}
