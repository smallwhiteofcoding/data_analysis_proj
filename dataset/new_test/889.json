{"text": "journalist bob woodward describes in his new book a secret u.s. program to assassinate terrorists in iraq . cnn 's michael ware says ,  the u.s. subcontracted out an assassination program against al qaeda ... in early 2006 .  woodward , an associate editor of the washington post , says in  the war within : a secret white house history 2006-2008  that the assassination program , not the 2007 increase in u.s. forces in the war zone known as  the surge ,  is primarily responsible for the reduction of violence in iraq . cnn baghdad correspondent michael ware cast doubt on woodward 's assertion tuesday in a conversation with  american morning  host john roberts . watch larry king on his talk with woodward  john roberts : what do you think of what woodward is saying ? michael ware : let 's say that these  fusion teams ,  as they 're being called , have come into effect . the first thing to say is ,  well , about time .  on the ground you 've seen the lack of coordination as the left hand of one agency is not with the right hand of another agency within the american effort . but by and large , to suggest that anything like this being done now has been the major reason for the decline in violence is a bit rich . i mean , the u.s. subcontracted out an assassination program against al qaeda way back in early 2006 . and this was conceded by the then-chief of military intelligence in baghdad and by -lsb- u.s. -rsb- ambassador zalmay khalilzad himself . that 's what broke the back of al qaeda . then when america put 100,000-plus insurgents on the u.s. government payroll , including members of al qaeda , that not only took them out of the field , but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the iranian-backed militias . roberts : so it sounds like assassination was a real part of the program here , but was that the only thing that worked ? what about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up ? did it all kind of work together ? ware : it does work together . but the key to the downturn in violence that we 're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself . what it 's been is the segregation of baghdad into these enclaves . it 's been cutting a deal with muqtada al-sadr , the leader of the iranian-backed militia . and primarily it 's been putting your enemy on your payroll -- the sunni insurgents and many members of al qaeda . that 's what 's brought down the violence . this is your american militia , the counterbalance to the iranian militias . so if there 's new teams out there with new technology , great . but they 're riding the wave of previous success .", "summary": "no summary"}
