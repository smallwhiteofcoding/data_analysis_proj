{"text": "harare , zimbabwe with polls closed for a zimbabwe runoff that opposition politicians and international observers call a sham , alleged torture victims who support former candidate morgan tsvangirai said friday that they back his decision to pull out of the race . many of the injured being treated at a private hospital in harare , zimbabwe , asked not to be identified .  it 's a good move by my president , morgan tsvangirai ,  said a 26-year-old movement for democratic change activist who said he was forced to stand on hot coals and had boiling water poured on him about a week ago .  there 's no use going for an election .  the man , who displayed a large , pale , blistered patch on his back , asked not to be identified -- as did others being treated at a private hospital in harare -- for fear of further attacks by gangs supportive of president robert mugabe . all of the victims said they were taken to  torture bases  by the gangs , made up of young men and soldiers . in the march 29 election , mdc officials said their polling showed tsvangirai clearly defeating mugabe , who at 84 is the only president zimbabwe has had since it gained independence from britain in 1980 . but after delaying the release of results for more than a week , the country 's electoral commission -- which is made up of mugabe appointees -- said that although tsvangirai got more votes , he did n't top the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff . mdc supporters had already reported violence against them by police , military members and other supporters of mugabe 's zanu-pf party . but in the weeks leading up to the runoff , the reports increased in frequency and intensity . more than 70 people were killed in attacks since the election , according to the mdc . mugabe 's supporters have claimed that those attacks were against his party members , a claim international observers , including the united nations , have disputed . watch victims say they were taken to torture camps  tsvangirai and other party leaders were repeatedly arrested by police or detained on their way to political rallies . and reports of beatings and other intimidation tactics were common in areas where the mdc had made strong showings in the election .  mostly for the rural people -- the police would come in for the zanu-pf , so the area was very tense ,  said a municipal worker at the hospital , who said he was kicked and had burning plastic poured on his skin about three or four days ago .  everyone was beaten . whether zanu-pf or mdc . there was chaos in the country .  george charamba , a spokesman for mugabe , insisted that the vote was  free and fair .  charamba denied that any pressure was being used . asked about images from zimbabwe showing what is reported to be violence against members of the opposition , he responded ,  i thought we are long past the age where we could consider pictures as not lying . it 's very , very easy for anyone to stage-manage a demonstration , and a violent one at that .  last weekend , tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff , saying there was no way the result would be legitimate . he has spent much of the time since living in the dutch embassy in harare in fear for his safety . early friday , the municipal worker said he was considering whether to heed tsvangirai 's call for his supporters to not vote in the election , but the question may be moot . the gangs took his identification card and threw it into a fire , he said . another man and a woman treated for broken hands at the hospital said they were tortured and had boiling water poured on their genitals for being mdc supporters . the man said he was forced to drink sewage . meanwhile , mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters from zimbabwe 's state-run media as he cast his ballot at a high school .  very optimistic , upbeat ... and hungry ,  he said when asked how he was feeling .", "summary": "no summary"}
