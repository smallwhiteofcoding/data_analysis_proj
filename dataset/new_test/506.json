{"text": "new delhi , india police imposed a curfew in jaipur on wednesday , a day after near-simultaneous bomb attacks in the ancient indian city killed at least 63 people and wounded more than 200 . indian women mourn the death of their relatives in the may 13 serial blasts in jaipur . vasundhara raje , chief minister of rajasthan -- the state of which jaipur is the capital -- blamed an  unnamed international terror group  for the attack , but said it was too early in the investigation to specify which one . h.g. ragavendhra , jaipur 's superintendent of police , told cnn that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene , and think they were used to carry the explosives . the owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them . police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them . jaipur , known as the  pink city  for its rose-colored forts and palaces , is a popular tourist attraction . the majority hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable muslim population . the day-long curfew , authorities said , was meant to prevent  communal violence .  it was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation , said jaipur police director kanhaiya lal . also , tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums , he said . home ministry officials suspect the islamic militant group harkat-ul-jihad al-islami -lrb- huji -rrb- of being behind the attacks , according to cnn 's sister network cnn-ibn and the press trust of india . no one has claimed responsibility . in the past , officials have blamed attacks within its borders on  foreign  islamic extremist groups fighting against indian rule in the disputed himalayan territory of kashmir . it is a term that is commonly understood to refer to pakistan . kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between india and pakistan . both control parts of the region , which is predominantly muslim . pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks . see the aftermath of the explosions .  raje told reporters wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state , the western edge of which lies next to pakistan . she also took to task the central government , saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack . furthermore , raje said , the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years . the bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks , she said . on tuesday evening , eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed hindu temple in jaipur 's walled city . the blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters -lrb- 0.3 miles -rrb- of each other . police defused a ninth bomb . the jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in india 's financial capital , mumbai . in july 2006 , more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in mumbai , formerly bombay . in that incident , the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes . both attacks used rdx , one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives , and ammonium nitrate , an oxidizing agent in explosives . and both attacks took place during the evening hours and on tuesdays . the jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to hanuman , the hindu monkey king . nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals . in the mumbai attack , the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour . and authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people . indian officials blamed pakistan 's intelligence services and a pakistan-based militant group , lashkar-e-tayyiba , for the attack . pakistan , which banned lashkar-e-tayyiba in 2002 , denied any involvement . the jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack : the use of bicycles . just as on tuesday , assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western indian city of malegaon in september 2006 . at least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion , which took place on a friday -- when the mosque is filled with muslim worshippers . that attack was also blamed lashkar-e-tayyiba . authorities have not connected the jaipur blast to any previous attacks . huji -- or the movement of islamic holy war -- is considered a terrorist organization by the united states . it is banned in neighboring bangladesh , where it is accused of carrying out several attacks , including a foiled plot to kill the country 's former prime minister sheikh hasina in 2000 . and it has been blamed for several attacks inside india , including one at the american center in calcutta that killed five policemen in 2002 . india ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common , the u.s. state department said .  the conflict in jammu and kashmir , attacks by extreme leftist naxalites and maoists in eastern and central india , assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states , and terrorist strikes nationwide by islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year ,  the agency said . cnn 's tess eastment and saeed ahmed contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
