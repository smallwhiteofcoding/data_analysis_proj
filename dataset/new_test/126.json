{"text": "the late chris benoit idolized the dynamite kid , who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying , acrobatic moves . chris benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in june . the dynamite kid and his partner , davey boy smith , were known as the british bulldogs . they were quick , agile and muscular , and in 1986 they won the world wrestling federation tag team championship . young benoit dreamed of wrestling like the dynamite kid , whose real name is tom billington . at the beginning of his career , benoit adopted the dynamite nickname and copied his idol 's signature moves . in june , benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself . investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in chris benoit 's body , georgia 's chief medical examiner said a month later . when asked about benoit 's double murder-suicide , billington told cnn ,  it can make you aggressive , the steroids . but personally i would n't , you know , kill no bleeding kid , or wife either .  billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside manchester , england . he has lost the use of his legs . a pin sticks out from one of his toes . billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body . and from the steroids , he said . billington told cnn that the steroids came from doctors , from friends , even from steroids meant for horses . he took them all , took a terrible pounding in the ring , and like his partner -lrb- who died at age 39 in 2002 -rrb- , began taking extensive amounts of painkillers . benoit 's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled , now known as world wrestling entertainment , and the man who has ruled wrestling for years , chairman of the board vince mcmahon . mcmahon , appearing with linda mcmahon , his wife and wwe ceo , told cnn :  nothing from the wwe , under any set of circumstances had anything to do with chris benoit murdering his family . how did we know chris benoit would turn into a monster .  read a full transcript of the mcmahons interview . vince mcmahon defended the organization , saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show .  our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else 's in sport , although again emphasizing we are entertainment , and no one in entertainment , no one has this kind of wellness policy ,  mcmahon said . critics say mcmahon pushes his stars and non-stars , works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling . they say mcmahon only looks at his employees as commodities , pawns in a huge business . his businesses are quite successful . about 16 million people a week tune into wwe tv shows . two of their cable programs --  raw  and  friday night smackdown  -- are weekly ratings giants . pay-per-view specials generate an average of $ 100 million per year . when asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old , vince mcmahon said each person in the wwe bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena .  if someone passes through our organization , it is not our responsibility for someone 's personal activities ,  he said . he also said there is n't  any organization in the world , be it entertainment or be it sport , that can tell you that they are totally drug-free .  watch as a wwe wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong  the mcmahons said the wwe is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes . since the newest wwe drug screening program began in february 2006 , more than 30 of the organization 's wrestlers have been suspended , including two since cnn 's interview with the mcmahons . david black -- who helped the nfl develop its drug program and now runs tests for the wwe -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning . but dr. gary wadler , a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes , says the wwe is not doing enough .  it certainly falls far , far short of where it needs to be ,  he said .  and there is a gold standard , and i measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard . and -lsb- the wwe is -rsb- miles apart .  wadler , a longtime critic of mcmahon , was referring to the u.s. anti-doping agency in colorado springs , colorado . u.s. athletes training for the olympics are randomly tested and , if caught just once , face a two-year suspension from competition . if caught a second time , they can be banned for life . black 's programs test wrestlers four times a year . the first is a  baseline  test , according to the wwe . black then tests for  nonmedical  uses , meaning that if an athlete has a prescription , he is cleared .  it 's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program ,  said travis tygart , who heads the u.s. anti-doping agency . mcmahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids . he says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years . watch one of the new wwe stars talk about being  straight edge    there 's an expression in our business , that here is where you make your money . it 's your face , it 's what you do with it ,  he said .  it 's your personality , it 's what you do with it . it 's your delivery , your elocution . it 's storyline , it 's things , all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's drew griffin contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
