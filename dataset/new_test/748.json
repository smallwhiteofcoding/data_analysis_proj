{"text": "los angeles , california luke russert , son of journalist tim russert , was part of a panel wednesday that discussed youth voting on cnn 's  larry king live .  luke russert says dinner table political discussions were part of his upbringing . besides the youth vote , russert discussed his father 's death , his upbringing and his own future in journalism and political commentary . tim russert , 58 , was the host of nbc 's  meet the press  and one of america 's leading political journalists . he died of a heart attack after collapsing at the network 's washington bureau on june 13 . the following is an edited version of the show 's transcript . watch video of the discussion  larry king : how did you learn of your dad 's passing ? luke russert : i was in florence , and i was at an italian sports bar watching the italy versus romania game , and i got a call from my dad 's secretary that said he had fainted , and could i get in touch with my mother . luckily , i was right across the street from the hotel where my mom was . i ran up to her room and said ,  dad has fainted .  and we kind of learned in increments of what exactly happened . so it was basically about a half-hour after first hearing that he fainted that we actually knew he collapsed and had a heart attack . and at first , i was upset that i was so far away and removed . and i really wanted to be there . but in reality , it was really a blessing to be an ocean away , because it allowed my mother and me to have some real private time to collect our thoughts , to grieve in private , and not be inundated with all the media coverage and all the phone calls . so , you know , it was something that -- it was difficult , but to have that little cocoon , i think my mother and i really used it to our benefit . king : must have been a long flight back . russert : it was . it was a long nine-hour flight . but my mother has been so strong through this . and my family has been there for me every step of the way . my girlfriend has been wonderful . so i ca n't thank everybody enough . and obviously this happened , but it has made it a lot easier to have such good friends at nbc and all through washington and my family personally . king : were you brought up talking politics ? russert : i was . it was always something that was always talked around the dinner table with my father and my mother from a very young age . one of my earliest memories is being a young toddler and remembering ronald reagan 's face on television . my dad was watching a press conference , most likely at that time on cnn . and it was just something that i always grew up around . and we also talked a lot of sports . we talked a lot of culture . but politics was something that i guess has been engrained in me at a very , very young age . king : did he pick the brains of you and your friends ? russert : he did . we would actually have some fun discussions where i would assume the role of who his guest would be on sunday and try to answer the questions that he threw at me . and sometimes , if i could answer a question pretty well , he 'd say ,  that question 's too easy , i 've got to get rid of it .  so sometimes , i was a guinea pig for politicians . but it was a lot of fun . i enjoyed doing it . and he would also pick the brains of some of my friends . some did pretty well , and some did n't . but he was always kind to all of us . king : when did you first vote ? russert : i first voted when i was 18 , which would have been 2004 . and i registered at the same time i registered for the selective service , which i think they do here in the district of columbia . so i 've been a registered voter since 2004 , and that 's the first time i cast an official ballot . king : how did it feel to vote ? russert : it felt great . it kind of felt like you became a man or at least an adult in some capacity . that your decision -- your decision -- became part of the country and its leadership . and i 'll never forget the way i voted was i was in college my freshman year , 2004 , so i had to go by absentee ballot . and i was going to meet my father in south bend , indiana , for the notre dame/boston college game . and i said ,  dad , i 'd rather you bring the ballot personally so it does n't have to go through the mail , send it up to me in boston .  so he brought the ballot , and i filled out my absentee ballot in a south bend , indiana , hotel room , and he brought it back and put it right in the fedex for me . king : we have an e-mail question for you from david in cary , north carolina .  luke , my condolences ,  it said .  you 've shown great strength and character in recent days . any chance we 'll see you reporting or doing commentary about the 2008 election ?  russert : oh yes , you just might . it 's something that i 'm definitely interested in . i think that i will probably be part of the peacock network . but you never know . i still have the sports show on xm radio and carville , and i kind of go into politics . but i would n't mind . king : what if cnn made a bid for you ? russert : i 'd be your assistant , larry ? king : you got it . you could come to work for us . i think i can speak for management . in fact , they 'll probably talk to you tomorrow based on just how well you 're handling yourself tonight . russert : well , i appreciate it . everyone has been so kind . i 'd love to have the opportunity to come out here and talk about something that is important to me . and it was important to my father , which was young people getting involved . that really is the important issue tonight . not me . that 's important .", "summary": "no summary"}
