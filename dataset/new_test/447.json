{"text": "the most compelling action during michigan 's primary tuesday will be on the republican side . the democratic party has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early , and top-tier democratic candidates have taken their names off the ballot , except for sen. hillary clinton . the struggling auto industry has been a drag on michigan 's economy . in many ways , the republican battle for michigan will be similar to last week 's new hampshire contest . the primary is open , and any registered voter -- including independents and democrats -- can participate . sen. john mccain won new hampshire with the help of independent voters , and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in michigan . in 2000 , mccain defeated then-texas gov. george w. bush in the michigan primary . in that vote , more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or democrats . among republican voters , mccain lost to bush 29 percent to 66 percent . in that contest , almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right . overall , michigan is a swing state , producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders . however , voting trends favor the democrats . michigan 's governor , jennifer granholm , is a democrat , as are the state 's two u.s. senators -- carl levin and debbie stabenow . the democratic presidential nominee has carried michigan in the last four elections . sen. john kerry , the democrats ' 2004 standard bearer , won michigan 51 percent to 48 percent over president bush . the state 's economy is powered by the automotive industry , which has experienced its fair share of struggles . michigan 's unemployment rate , 7.4 percent , is higher than the national average of 5 percent . region by region . wayne county , in the southeastern corner of the state , contains the economically depressed detroit , michigan 's largest city . detroit is predominantly black and solidly democratic . north of wayne county are the more-affluent suburban counties of oakland and macomb , which have grown in population in the last two decades . these two counties have been the state 's central political battleground in recent elections . west of wayne is the  university belt ,  home to the university of michigan in ann arbor and michigan state university in east lansing . the area also includes the industrial cities of saginaw and flint , where unions remain strong , as well as jackson and bay city . the state 's capital , lansing , and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region . the southwest part of the state is dominated by grand rapids , michigan 's second-largest city . grand rapids is traditionally dutch-american and has many christian conservatives and generally votes republican . the area also contains smaller industrial cities and farming communities . the economy of the sparsely populated north and northwest is based on agriculture , tourism and timber . it traditionally votes republican . endorsements . the detroit free press has endorsed mccain .  while the free press differs with mccain on a number of issues , the arizona senator is a smarter , more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances around issues ,  the newspaper said in an editorial . the detroit news also endorsed mccain , citing his fiscal conservatism and command of military and foreign affairs , over michigan native mitt romney .  other gop contenders , most notably former massachusetts gov. mitt romney , are capable figures with impressive resumes and a solid grasp of the issues . but mccain 's longtime presidential ambitions are at last aligned with the needs of the nation ,  the newspaper said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
