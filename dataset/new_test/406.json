{"text": "okay , you 've decided what model of car you want to buy . and you know , more or less , how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford . you 've kicked tires , talked to salesmen , taken a few shiny new numbers for a test-drive and you 're ready to make the deal . if you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections . except , you 're not quite done . you still need to decide whether to buy any of those  extras  that your salesperson will always suggest . some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding . others ... maybe not so much . the list of  extras  offered by most dealers , may include paint sealant , fabric protection/leather care , extended warranties , extended ` one price ' service contracts , rust/underbody coatings and anti-theft systems , to mention a few . we wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without . to get to the bottom of it , we thought we would consult an expert -- david bennett , manager of automotive programs for aaa . as it turns out , like most things in life , the answer often just comes down to what 's best for you , depending on your own situation , budget or locale . let 's address these add-ons one by one : . paint sealant .  i think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days , so in most cases you probably do n't need that anymore ,  said bennett , who offered one caveat .  but that can depend on what part of the country you live in -- what the climate is , whether you get a lot of snow and ice , and what the road crews put down on the road -- whether it is salt , or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint . but generally , as long as you keep your car washed , and wash that salt off of it , and get it waxed regularly , that paint should last without getting the ` add-on ' sealer at the dealership . also , if you get a chip or a ding , get it fixed so the rust does n't get a chance to set in and spread .  fabric / leather protection . these extras are fairly self-explanatory -- the dealer  treats  the upholstered or leather seating with a  protection  product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks .  this can be a good purchase , but the first question you should ask before buying it is , ` what kind of lifestyle do i lead ? ' suggests bennett .  do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things ? or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults ?  do you eat in the car with some regularity ? if so , and you 're just too darn messy for your own good , a stain protection might be a good way to go .  also , look at exclusions in the plan ,  advises bennett .  if you 're a smoker , and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes , and you 're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short , that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion . each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different , and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase , because it might not be a good one for you .  if you want to save some cash , one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner . to remove spots from a leather seat , use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth . if the spot still remains , let it sit for a few hours . repeat , as they say , if necessary . it 's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance . rustproofing . this is when the dealership applies various rust-inhibiting chemicals , waxes or sealers to the vehicle 's undercarriage . it can also be applied to other rust-prone areas . rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years . keep in mind that some guarantees require annual  checkups  to re-apply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged .  i do n't think this is necessary in most cases ,  opines bennett .  the way most vehicles are constructed today , they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north , where they get a lot of snow .  lojack car security system / anti-theft systems : . the folks at lojack car security systems report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the u.s. using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle . but if you want to go the more high-tech  tracking  route , using a security system like lojack may give you more peace of mind . the lojack system , includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle . the system uses a code that is tied into the vehicle identification number -lrb- vin -rrb- . then , when you report that your car has been stolen , the state police crime computer can match code against the state vin database . this automatically activates the lojack system in the vehicle -- emitting an inaudible signal . then , police cruisers and aviation units that have the lojack tracking system can identify the vehicle 's location , track it and recover it . lojack claims that over 200,000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system , with over 100,000 of those in the u.s.  whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors . if you live in a high-crime area , a system like this could provide you with peace of mind ,  advises bennett .  but even if you live in a safe , low-crime district , your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage ,  he notes . one caveat : some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen , especially if it has been seriously vandalized , or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems . another thing to consider is that owners of gm vehicles that come with its patented onstar system , probably wo n't need a theft tracking program , says bennett .  because the system allows onstar operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen . so if you buy a gm car with the onstar system , you may want to pass on a lojack or similar tracking system .  extended warranties .  this really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle , because most of these extended warranty plans do n't kick in until the manufacturer 's warranty expires ,  advises bennett .  and these days , those manufacturers warranties are three or five years , sometimes longer .  so if you plan on selling the car after three or five years , it probably does n't make sense to buy the extended warranty .  some warranties offer transferable policies , which let you  sell  the warranty along with the vehicle . others allow you to  return  the warranty for a pro-rated refund . bennett also explains that not all warranties are created equal .  they usually have three levels of warranties : a basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain , for example ; while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed -- or an ` exclusionary ' extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed . at the top end , the best warranty just covers everything , but that is also the most expensive .  bennett gives an example of one manufacturers warranty .  for a 2007 buick , the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain coverage , and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100,000 miles . in fact , that 's the same warranty gm offers on their chevy and cadillac brands .   that 's a pretty good warranty , so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less , the extended warranty is probably money you do n't need to spend .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
