{"text": "more than 100 countries attending a conference in dublin , ireland formally adopted a treaty friday to ban cluster bombs -- a large , unreliable and inaccurate weapon that often affects civilians long after the end of armed conflict . cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers . a document released by ireland 's department of foreign affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain . the countries also agreed never to develop , acquire , retain or transfer cluster munitions . countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty wednesday but formally signed it friday . the accord calls for a total , immediate ban of the weapons , strong standards to protect those injured by them , contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed , he said . thomas nash , coordinator of the cmc campaigning organization , said wednesday :  this is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons .  though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs , including the united states , russia , china and israel , were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord , organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance .  take the united states ,  nash said .  almost all of its allies are here . they 've decided to ban these weapons . that 's going to make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for the united states to ever use these weapons again , either on its own or in joint operations .  the agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years , he said . cluster munitions , which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets , are what the international committee of the red cross calls a  persistent humanitarian problem .  most of a cluster bomb 's bomblets are meant to explode on impact , but many do not . estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time , the red cross says . that means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area , often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians . last week , acting assistant secretary for political-military affairs stephen d. mull called it  an absolute moral obligation  to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle . but he also predicted that the united states would not agree to any ban .  we think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions ... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use ,  mull said .  the united states relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy .  instead , he urged that the weapons be regulated  to take humanitarian considerations into account  and that  technological fixes  be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle . during the 34-day war in lebanon in 2006 , the united nations estimated that israel dropped 4 million bomblets , 1 million of which may not have exploded , according to the international committee of the red cross . more than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern lebanon since the war ended . cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in kosovo . lt. col. jim burke , a military adviser to the irish defense forces said they quickly became a major killer of civilians . in more than 20 countries , according to the icrc , cluster bombs have created lasting  no-go  areas , rendering them as dangerous as minefields . laos is the most affected country . millions of bomblets dropped during the vietnam war continue to kill civilians more than three decades later . still , militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area , such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape . a single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles . cnn 's jacqueline clyne contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
