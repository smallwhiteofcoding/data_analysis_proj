{"text": "jerusalem the u.n. security council failed to reach a consensus when it met to consider condemning an attack that killed eight people at a prominent jewish seminary as an act of terrorism . ambulance workers put one of the casualties from the seminary attack into an ambulance . the council said libya -- a new , nonpermanent member -- blocked the statement on thursday night . ibrahim dabbashi , libya 's deputy ambassador to the united nations , said the attack on the school was no different than israeli military offensives against militants in gaza . but dan gillerman , israel 's ambassador to the united nations , said he saw no connection between thursday 's shooting and israel 's operations in gaza .  this is not a story of retaliation ,  he said .  these people have been terrorizing israel for years , have been carrying out suicide bombings and indiscriminate attacks for years .  a gunman broke into the jewish seminary about 8:30 p.m. , spraying automatic-weapons fire , authorities said . most of the victims were students in their teens and 20s , medical officials said . at least nine others were wounded before an off-duty israel defense forces officer fatally shot the gunman , jerusalem district police commander aharon franko said . the gunman was carrying an ak-47 and a pistol -- and had time to swap weapons during the massacre . police are trying to identify the gunman and figure out how he managed , while drawing little notice , to enter the large three-story school in a bustling residential neighborhood .  there was no alert or warning about this attack ,  franko said . watch the immediate aftermath of the attack  a first responder said the bodies were on the floor of the study hall surrounded by holy books . no group has claimed responsibility for the attack . video from thursday 's scene showed a frantic crowd of rescue workers carrying bloodied victims into ambulances . dozens of police officers were scouring the campus and streets around the yeshiva in case there were other gunmen . outside the school , scores of israeli men gathered from surrounding neighborhoods , demanding justice for the attack . authorities are calling the incident at west jerusalem 's merkaz harav yeshiva an act of terrorism . the school is one of the largest seminaries in israel , with about 500 students in the yeshiva and 200 in an advanced graduate program .  israel is at the forefront of the struggle against terrorism and will continue to defend its citizens , who are exposed to this threat on a daily basis ,  israel 's foreign ministry said in a written statement .  israel expects the nations of the world to support it in its war against those who murder students , women and children , by any means and with respect for neither place nor target .  president bush backed israeli leaders in a statement issued thursday , saying ,  i condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack in jerusalem that targeted innocent students at the merkaz harav yeshiva . this barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the condemnation of every nation .  but libya 's dabbashi compared the attack with  bloodshed in the palestinian territory .   for us , the human lives are the same . we judge the incident itself ,  dabbashi told reporters after the security council meeting .  when we have to condemn the killing of the israeli civilians , we also have to look at what 's happening in gaza .  jerusalem security increased . security was bolstered , with thousands of additional officers across jerusalem and the rest of israel , authorities said . meanwhile , celebratory shooting took place in gaza city after the news of the attack , with hundreds chanting and clapping in the streets . but palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas criticized the killings .  the palestinian authority condemns any attack on innocent civilians ,  abbas ' office said in a written statement . the shootings came just a day after u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , who met with both israelis and palestinians , announced that peace talks will resume between the two sides . abbas suspended peace negotiations last week after fierce fighting broke out between israel and palestinian militants in gaza , but he agreed to resume negotiations after meeting with rice . israel will continue peace talks with the palestinians regardless of the attack in jerusalem , foreign ministry spokesman aryeh mekel said thursday . israel conducted a large-scale operation in gaza to hunt down palestinian militants who have been firing dozens of rockets into israel . at least 70 palestinians and two israeli soldiers were killed during the operation , israeli and palestinian sources said . militants also fired at least 25 rockets toward israel , wounding at least two civilians .  this operation came directly after the attack committed inside gaza . this operation is a normal response ,  said fawzi barhoom , a hamas spokesman in gaza . watch barhoom 's reaction to the attack  gillerman said the security council should condemn the attack .  they are so , so quick sometimes to criticize israel for defending itself . i would like to see those members convene as we speak in order to condemn this in the strongest possible terms .  thursday 's attack was the worst inside israel since april 17 , 2006 , when a suicide bombing outside a falafel restaurant in tel aviv killed nine people . islamic jihad claimed responsibility for that attack . attacks in jerusalem are rare . eight people were wounded august 10 in the old city when a palestinian resident grabbed a security guard 's gun and fired ; and four israeli security guards were wounded may 26 when two palestinian gunmen began firing in east jerusalem . all three of the assailants were killed . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ben wedeman and atika shubert contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
