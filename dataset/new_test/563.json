{"text": "san diego , california on the question of whether recent immigrants assimilate as quickly as previous waves , many americans exhibit short fuses -- and even shorter memories . ruben navarrette jr. notes that immigrants have been criticized throughout history for not assimilating . they have convinced themselves that , instead of adapting to the customs of this country , new arrivals -- most of whom come from asia or latin america -- expect the rest of us to accommodate them . they go ballistic over little things -- mexican flags , taco trucks , libraries that offer bilingual story time , or having to  press one for english .  yet , even as they look down on new immigrants , many americans look back fondly upon their immigrant ancestors . legend has it that when grandpa arrived from ireland , germany , italy or poland , he jumped off the boat , immediately draped himself in the american flag , ripped out his native tongue , and abandoned his culture -- all while singing  yankee doodle dandy .  germans did not move to milwaukee and make beer and cheese . the irish did not settle in boston and join organizations like the hibernian society to preserve their heritage and culture . and even while americans complain about how the current crop of immigrants are n't like their predecessors , they miss the irony : at the time , there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors ; the germans were thought to not be like the english , the irish were n't like the germans , the italians were n't like the irish etc. . and the chinese were n't like anyone who had come before them , and so they were labeled  unassimilable  by the tom tancredos of that era . some things never change . when i was growing up in central california , which is home to a large population of immigrants from southeast asia , thousands would gather to celebrate hmong new year . the local newspaper would do a feature . and , in the days that followed , someone would write an angry letter to the editor complaining that these people were n't melting into the pot . yet , there is more melting going on than one might think , according to a new report from the manhattan institute . billed as the first annual index of immigrant assimilation , the study was written by duke university professor jacob vigdor . it measured three kinds of assimilation : economic -lrb- employment , education , homeownership , etc. -rrb- ; cultural -lrb- intermarriage , english proficiency , family size , etc. -rrb- ; and civic -lrb- citizenship , military service , political participation , etc. -rrb- . far from discovering that recent immigrants are ducking the assimilation process , the study found that  immigrants of the past quarter-century have assimilated more rapidly than their counterparts of a century ago , even though they are more distinct from the native population upon arrival .  of course , individual groups still fall behind in some categories . chinese and indian immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation . mexican immigrants have low levels of economic assimilation . and canadian and indian immigrants have low levels of civic assimilation , since few of them become citizens . but , overall , the news is good . after more than 200 years , america still does an excellent job of assimilating immigrants . even if a particular group tried to resist the process , they would n't stand a chance . assimilation happens , whether the immigrants are ready or not . those are the facts . of course , fear does n't listen to facts . that is something else that has n't changed . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .", "summary": "no summary"}
