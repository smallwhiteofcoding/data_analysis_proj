{"text": "shanghai , china -- championship leader lewis hamilton spun out of the chinese grand prix to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in brazil on october 21 . a disconsolate lewis hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in shanghai . rookie hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race , but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by mclaren team-mate fernando alonso in shanghai . the spaniard finished second behind ferrari 's kimi raikkonen , who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of hamilton . the young briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions . however , the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires , which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let finland 's raikkonen take the lead . and when hamilton -- who won in japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane , he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go . raikkonen and alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps , with the finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both hamilton and alonso . raikkone 's team-mate felipe massa was third , while fourth place was claimed by toro rosso 's sebastien vettel , who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in japan behind the safety car while hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing . britain 's jenson button was fifth in a honda ahead of vettel 's team-mate vitantonio liuzzi , while germany 's nick heidfeld was seventh for bmw sauber and david coulthard of scotland took the final point for red bull . hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season .  i 'm sorry for the team but i can still do it , do n't worry ,  he said .  when i got out of the car i was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year , and to do it on the way into the pits was not something i usually do .  you can not go through life without making mistakes . but i am over it and we look forward to brazil . the team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there , and we still have points in the bag .  we were having a great race and we did n't know if it was going to rain or not . the tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath . when i came into the pits it was like ice , i could n't do anything about it .  mclaren boss ron dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off .  it 's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this . it has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another grand prix ,  dennis said .  i do n't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did lewis . but the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance . that 's what made the difference .  it was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier , but would it have made a difference ? all the top teams -- ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire .  alonso , who qualified for the race in fourth , is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles .  the result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure ,  he said .  i think the championship will still be very difficult because i know it will not be easy to take four points from lewis .  i need something dramatic if i want to win . with a normal race it will be impossible .  raikkonen added :  we are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race .  hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend . it is not just up to us though , we saw today that anything can happen , but we are back in the championship .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
