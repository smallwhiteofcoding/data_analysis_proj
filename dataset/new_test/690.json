{"text": "sydney , australia -- eamon sullivan regained the 50-meter freestyle world record with a 21.41 seconds swim at the australian olympic trials in sydney . sullivan had lost his 50m freestyle record to frenchman alain bernard four days ago . he took the record back from frenchman alain bernard , who recorded 21.50 seconds at the european championships four days ago . sullivan had held the record with 21.56 , set in sydney in february . after missing out on bernard 's 100m record late on wednesday , sullivan said he hoped to improve his 50m time in friday 's final .  i came in a bit more relaxed tonight , having got the 100m final out of the way last night and getting into the team for beijing .  it 's sweet to get the record back off alain after missing out on the 100m world record last night and after he broke the 50m record so quickly after i did it .  i know i have another swim left so there 's always another chance . i hope i can go faster in the final , but i like to think i can take a couple of a hundredths of a second leading into a final , so we 'll see .  sullivan missed bernard 's 100m world record by just two-hundredths of a second in qualifying in 47.52 seconds for the olympics . libby trickett broke the women 's 100m freestyle world record with a 52.88 seconds swim . trickett , formerly libby lenton and competing for the first time under her married name , beat the 53.30 mark set by germany 's britta steffen in budapest on august 2 , 2006 . it is the second time trickett has broken the 53-second barrier , but her previous time of 52.99 at the duel in the pool in sydney last year was not ratified by fina because she was swimming against american superstar michael phelps .  i ca n't tell you how much i wanted to break that record ever since doing it in the duel in the pool in april last year . i just wanted it so badly ,  trickett said .  to see it officially up there on the scoreboard is just amazing . all my events are very important to me , but the 100m freestyle holds a special place in my heart and to know that four years ago i was going 0.8 seconds off , that is just awesome .   i 've come so far , it 's been an amazing journey , but i am just so happy to be part of this team . we have some fantastic girls coming through and it 's going to be great for our relay team .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
