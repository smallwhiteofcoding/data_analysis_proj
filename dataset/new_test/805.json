{"text": "italian newspapers , an archbishop and civil liberties campaigners expressed shock and revulsion on monday after photographs were published of sunbathers apparently enjoying a day at the beach just meters from where the bodies of two drowned roma girls were laid out on the sand . photographs of the dead roma girls on a beach caused outrage in italy . italian news agency ansa reported that the incident had occurred on saturday at the beach of torregaveta , west of naples , southern italy , where the two girls had earlier been swimming in the sea with two other roma girls . reports said they had gone to the beach to beg and sell trinkets . local news reports said the four girls found themselves in trouble amid fierce waves and strong currents . emergency services responded 10 minutes after a distress call was made from the beach and two lifeguards attended the girls upon hearing their screams . two of them were pulled to safety but rescuers failed to reach the other two in time to save them . watch why the photos have generated anger  the web site of the archbishop of naples said the girls were cousins named violetta and cristina , aged 12 and 13 . their bodies were eventually laid out on the sand under beach towels to await collection by police . photographs show sunbathers in bikinis and swimming trunks sitting close to where the girls ' feet can be seen poking out from under the towels concealing their bodies . a photographer who took photos at the scene told cnn the mood among sunbathers had been one of indifference . other photos show police officers lifting the bodies into coffins and carrying them away past bathers reclined on sun loungers .  while the lifeless bodies of the girls were still on the sand , there were those who carried on sunbathing or having lunch just a few meters away ,  italian newspaper la repubblica reported . corriere della sera said that a crowd of curious onlookers that had formed around the bodies quickly dispersed .  few left the beach or abandoned their sunbathing . when the police from the mortuary arrived an hour later with coffins , the two girls were carried away between bathers stretched out in the sun .  the incident also attracted condemnation from the archbishop of naples , cardinal crecenzio seppe .  indifference is not an emotion for human beings ,  seppe wrote in his parish blog .  to turn the other way or to mind your own business can sometimes be more devastating than the events that occur .  recent weeks have seen heightened tensions between italian authorities and the country 's roma minority amid a crackdown by silvo berlusconi 's government targeting illegal immigrants and talk by government officials of a  roma emergency  that has seen the 150,000-strong migrant group blamed for rising street crime . that has provided justification for police raids on roma camps and controversial government plans to fingerprint all roma -- an act condemned by the european parliament and united nations officials as a clear act of racial discrimination . popular resentment against romanies has also seen roma camps near naples attacked and set on fire with petrol bombs by local residents . in a statement published on its web site , the italian civil liberties group everyone said saturday 's drowning had occurred in an atmosphere of  racism and horror  and cast doubt on the reported version of events , suggesting that it appeared unusual for the four girls to wade into the sea , apparently casting modesty aside and despite being unable to swim .  the most shocking aspect of all this is the attitude of the people on the beach ,  the statement said .  no one appears the slightest upset at the sight and presence of the children 's dead bodies on the beach : they carry on swimming , sunbathing , sipping soft drinks and chatting .  cnn 's jennifer eccleston contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
