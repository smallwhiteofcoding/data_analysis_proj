{"text": "it may take a lot of frequent-flier miles , a penchant for cold places , a tolerance of taxes and regular doses of chocolate , but happiness could be within reach . however , it 's not where most people might expect . journalist eric weiner says he wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness . just ask eric weiner , who made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe , uncovering lots of surprises along the way . hungering for a tropical paradise ? a warm climate does n't necessarily make a happy nation , weiner said . thinking of moving to a wealthy state ? money can degrade happiness , he found . weiner , who wrote the book ,  the geography of bliss : one grump 's search for the happiest places in the world ,  began his quest for very personal reasons .  i 'm an unhappy person , so it 's kind of what prompts a hungry person to search for food ,  he said . weiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for national public radio , a job that took him to some of the least happy places in the world . it was enough to send him on a yearlong journey to look for just the opposite . weiner mapped out his quest with a combination of scientific and personal methods , choosing some countries because they traditionally score high on happiness surveys and selecting others to see how factors like money play a role . a world map of happiness , based on 100 different studies and produced by britain 's university of leicester in 2006 , listed denmark as the world 's happiest nation . but for weiner , the place where he felt the most bliss was a toss-up between bhutan and iceland , countries that ranked eighth and fourth , respectively , on the happiness map . weiner 's list of favorites also included thailand , india and switzerland . see photos of his favorites and listen to him explain why they 're happy  his top two picks , though very different countries , have unconventional paths to happiness , he said .  bhutan is probably the closest thing on earth to shangri-la , that fictional paradise ,  weiner explained . he pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product , the himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of  gross national happiness .   the bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision ,  weiner said . cold place , warm relationships . thousands of miles away , weiner found happiness in a very different environment , marveling at the creativity and  coziness  of iceland .  everyone in iceland is a poet ,  weiner recalled . he visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the cold and the darkness . such a chilly climate usually encourages warm relationships , weiner found .  the cold inspires people to cooperate , traditionally . if you go back a few hundred years , people in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together . it 's that simple ,  he said . weiner found a different flavor of happiness in switzerland , where he discovered people are content partly because everything runs like clockwork . simple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness , he said . but there may be a much sweeter reason why switzerland is a happy place .  the swiss eat a lot of chocolate , and let 's not forget that ,  weiner said . he was also impressed with how the swiss view money .  their attitude is that if you 've got it , hide it . while our attitude is if you 've got it , flaunt it ,  weiner said , comparing the swiss to americans . weiner called the united states , which came in at no. 23 on the university of leicester 's world map of happiness , a nation that  is not as happy as it is wealthy .  the impact of wealth and taxes . the relationship between money and happiness took weiner to the middle east and qatar , a country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world , thanks to oil and natural gas revenues , according to the cia world factbook .  i went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery ,  weiner said . he found the wealth made the residents comfortable , but also degraded their level of contentment .  most of our happiness is derived from our relationships with other people ,  weiner said .  the money in qatar has allowed them to wall themselves off , literally and figuratively , from other people . ... that 's not a recipe for happiness .  there are no income taxes in qatar , but that 's not a cause for contentment , weiner found . some taxation is necessary for happiness because it 's a way of being invested in a place , he argued .  you 're giving money to someone else , a government , and you 're trusting them to do something good with it ,  weiner said .  in a country where there 's no taxation at all , people do n't have vested interests in how well the government performs . you ca n't say , ` hey , those are my tax dollars at work . '  quest creates buzz . weiner 's book has struck a chord , recently rising to the top 10 of the new york times nonfiction best-seller list . an expert who studies happiness said part of the book 's appeal may lie in how weiner mapped out his journey .  he arranges an interesting itinerary because he uses science as his compass ,  said daniel gilbert , a psychology professor at harvard university and the author of  stumbling on happiness .  gilbert said it 's only recently that a combination of biology , sociology and psychology has been able to answer the  where 's and why 's  of happiness , a subject that has always fascinated people .  the quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings ,  gilbert said . he echoed weiner 's findings that bliss is other people .  everyone has been telling us for the longest time that happiness is about social relationships , well , bingo , they 're right ,  gilbert said . meanwhile , after a year of exploring some of the world 's happiest places , weiner -- the self-described  grump  -- said his mind-set has improved somewhat .  i would describe myself as a recovering grump ,  weiner said .  at this point , i think i am marginally happier than before i started the project .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
