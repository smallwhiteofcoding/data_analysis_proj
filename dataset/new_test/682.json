{"text": "toss that basic black and indulge in a fashion fantasy this year . we asked the four gorgeous stars of abc 's new tv show  cashmere mafia  to take part in a little experiment : if you could slip into a different guise for a day , what would it be ? frances o'connor in zac posen silk gown , josé and maría barrera rhodium-plated earrings with austrian crystals . frances o'connor glams it up . understated when it comes to her own style and buttoned up in banker stripes as zoe on cashmere mafia , frances o'connor , 40 , has been hankering for an infusion of pure glamour .  i love the idea of wearing a dress that 's a work of art in itself ,  says the actress , who slipped easily into a red-carpet fantasy with a mouthwatering cherry-hued gown by zac posen . o'connor 's  safety first  approach to fashion means living mostly in simple marc jacobs pieces , but it 's a sensibility that does n't offer much in the way of frippery -- which suits her just fine .  i do n't like to stand out too much ,  says the willowy anglo-aussie beauty . still , posen 's fluttering cascades of silk offer both a role reversal and a respite .  a fantasy has to move you to feel like a different person ,  she says .  that 's fun for a day . then i like to put my jeans back on and go home .  lucy liu relives the forties . few decades enthrall lucy liu like the 1940s .  i like the idea of updating a traditional silhouette from that era in a fresh way ,  says liu , whose character , mia , reigns over a new york publishing fiefdom in power looks by dolce & gabbana , valentino and rachel roy . despite its abstract floral print , the ruffled organza dress by christian lacroix would seem right at home on the cover of a world war ii-period glossy , yet liu imbues it with a distinctly modern verve .  there was something really elegant and erotic about women back then , with their girdles and cinched-in waists ,  she says . on the set the 39-year-old star relishes watching costume designer patricia field work her sartorial sorcery with a swirl of offbeat textures and trimmings .  the other day my character was wearing a gold lamé striped dress with a coffee-hued belt , black leggings and green earrings . it 's contagious ,  says liu , who finds herself mixing -- and not matching -- more freely these days . miranda otto indulges in gems . famous for playing a middle earth maiden in the lord of the rings movies , aussie actress miranda otto found herself dressing a little like one offscreen too , in muted , ethereal garb . but her arctic complexion and fiery tresses are the perfect canvas on which to throw splashes of drama .  shooting cashmere mafia -lsb- the 40-year-old beauty plays steely hotelier juliet -rsb- has made me lust for accessories ,  she says . presto : otto is resplendent in scads of jewelry .  wearing stacks of the stuff makes it more interesting ,  she adds . there 's just one catch to donning such beguiling accents :  my 2-year-old daughter , darcey , wants everything .  bonnie somerville goes for fifties bombshell . bonnie somerville longs for the bygone days when women were perennially polished .  in the fifties you 'd never leave the house without your hair done , your face on , and a nice dress . me , i have my staple uniform of jeans , tank tops and flats .  to resolve her clothing ennui , the actress chose a dazzling yellow lela rose number that is equal parts bond girl and palm beach socialite .  it 's something i never thought i could wear for daytime ,  says the brooklyn , new york-bred singer and actress who plays cashmere 's trendy cosmetics exec , caitlin . a skinny metallic belt gives the look more of a now vibe .  on the show , with everything we wear , patricia field says , ` put a belt on it ! '  says somerville , 33 .  now i 'm buying belts in my real life , which i never did before .  e-mail to a friend . get a free trial issue of instyle - click here ! copyright © 2008 time inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
