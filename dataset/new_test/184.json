{"text": "tampa , florida some christian congregations , particularly in lower income , urban areas , are turning to an unlikely source for help -- the church of scientology . rev , charles kennedy uses scientology founder l. ron hubbard 's book during a friday night sermon . scientologists do not worship god , much less jesus christ . the church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult . so why are observant christians embracing some of its teachings ? two pastors who spoke recently with cnn explained that when it comes to religion , they still preach the core beliefs of christianity . but when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world , borrowing from scientology helps . the rev. charles kennedy , of the glorious church of god in christ , a pentecostal church in tampa , florida , and the rev. james mclaughlin , of the wayman chapel african methodist episcopal church in houston , texas , are among the theological hybrids . watch rev. kennedy preach  they say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting , secretive ways and rigid theology . as men of god rooted in christian values , they do not see scientology as a threat to their faith , but rather as a tool to augment it . scientology was founded in the 1950s by l. ron hubbard , a science fiction writer . followers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans . although the church says there is a supreme being , its practices do not include worshipping god .  i 'm looking for solutions , and the people that i help , they do n't ask me who l. ron hubbard is ,  said mclaughlin , who works with addicts .  you know what they say ? ` thank god . '  critic rick ross , a court-certified scientology expert , sees something more sinister at work . he warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal -- new recruits .  their hope is that through these programs , people will become more interested in l. ron hubbard , what else mr. hubbard had to offer , and this will lead them eventually to scientology ,  ross said . the church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cult-like mind control . it is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers . and according to published reports , scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups . kennedy , mclaughlin and a handful of other christian church leaders -- no one can say how many -- are finding answers to their communities ' needs in scientology 's social programs . for kennedy , it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at the church of scientology 's spiritual headquarters in clearwater , florida . he was introduced to a book called  the way to happiness  -- hubbard 's 64-page , self-described  common sense guide to better living .  in the book , which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle , kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income african-american congregation . he said the book 's 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportunity . kennedy knew that before he could introduce any scientology-related text to his congregation , he would have to prove that it did not contradict his christian beliefs . and so , he found scripture to match each of the 21 principles . now kennedy uses  the way to happiness  as a how-to supplement to his sermons . he believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient scriptures taken from the bible . when asked whether scientology 's values contradict the religion of jesus christ , kennedy replies ,  sometimes yes . sometimes no .  but he says his congregation can relate to  the way to happiness .  kennedy admits other pastors have criticized him , but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him . he insists that he has witnessed the changes  the way to happiness  has inspired in people . he also maintains that the scientologists , many of whom he calls friends , are successful at outreach and getting desired results . at kennedy 's c. l. kennedy center , free tutoring based on hubbard 's  study tech  philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults . kennedy 's daughter , jimirra , is one of the instructors . she said  study tech  and the scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman . though jimirra kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of scientology , she still considers herself , at least in part , scientologist .  we say this all the time and i know my father says this , but i am like a pentecostal scientologist , that 's what we are .  critics like ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines . they consider it a marketing win for scientology . in houston , mclaughlin says he is not one to argue with success . driven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his community , mclaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered  narconon ,  scientology 's nonprofit drug rehab center , in 2001 . mclaughlin trained at narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch  first step faith step ,  a program that combines hubbard 's methods with the teachings of christianity . he claims a 70 - to 80-percent rehabilitation success rate . kennedy and mclaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to scientology .  i think that they truly believe that this may help their communities , but in my opinion , they 're na√Øve ,  ross said . scientologists , he added ,  have their own agenda .  the church of scientology would not grant cnn an interview , nor would its representatives answer questions about the hubbard-based programs . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
