{"text": "not only is sheikha lubna al qasimi the first woman to hold a ministerial post in the united arab emirates , the first female minister of economy in the gulf , and the first to start a middle eastern bb marketplace , but she 's also the first minister - anywhere in the world - to launch her own perfume line . member of sharjah royal family and one of forbes ' 100 most powerful women , sheikha lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of united arab emirates in 2004 . her background is in it and before the government appointment worked at the dubai ports authority where she gained the  distinguished government employee award  in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes . in 2000 , sheikha lubna founded tejari , the first middle eastern business-to-business marketplace . as a result of tejari -lrb- arabic for commerce -rrb- 70 percent of dubai 's government purchases are made online , while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch . one of the cornerstones of sheikha lubna 's work has been to allow for foreign ownership , so when john defterios met up with her , he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy . sheikha lubna : we are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors . we will evaluate each sector , from the service side , finance , accounting . and any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth , then we will focus on that : on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company . defterios : if you look at the middle east , specifically within this gulf region , it 's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership . is this society in the region ready for this move ? sheikha lubna : interestingly , the united arab emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside . we host 200 nationalities , so for us , the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community . so in many ways i think the openness is only a natural path : it 's an organic path to continue the openness that exists . foreign direct investment is not your own wealth . when you have your own wealth , you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes , because it 's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure . however , if you look at foreign direct investment , it mandates you to be much more transparent , you have to be very diligent about your work , and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment . defterios : it 's interesting , you read the front line of the dp world , p&o acquisition and the furor it created in the united states particularly within congress . what are the lessons , not just from the uae perspective , but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process ? sheikha lubna : first of all , i think it is important to understand , in this global world , there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere . liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad . we 've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad . and we 've seen this where the uae invests in the far east , australia , asia as well as in europe and the united states . what 's more important to understand is that if you 're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that i do n't want to sell to this particular organization versus another , there are other places . defterios : that 's not a veiled message your saying , that 's pretty forthright this comment . sheikha lubna : but it 's a message to all of us . if today i lock up my investment opportunity here , money will not come to me , money will go somewhere else . when i have investment coming from abroad , it creates confidence in this country that ' i am a global image ' . so when i say it , i am not directing this as a message to a particular country . i am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation , when it comes to responsibility , when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country . so that 's really a lesson that 's very very critical . defterios : a number of firsts : the first to start a b2b marketplace ; the first female minister within the country , an economy minister ; and the first to launch a perfume range as well . what is it all about ? trailblazing , setting examples , being an entrepreneur ? how would you describe what you 're doing here ? sheikha lubna : everybody laughs about the perfume . one , i think the united arab emirates , since inception -lrb- it 's not from today but from the founder late sheikh zayed -rrb- has always given equal opportunities for women . but it 's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push , and what it is that we can do and not do . in my personal belief you need a bridge , you need a door opener for women . and sometimes women do not want to take the risk . sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving . i had the opportunity and i had the trust from the government and the community , so to me , it is setting the example internally for the young women , and men by the way . be it in technology , or economy or e-commerce . defterios : and the perfume line is the exclamation point ? sheikha lubna : a young woman , actually a perfume creator , who sells exclusively to saks fifth avenue in dubai , decided to create a perfume with my name . so i had two mandates from her . one , i had to smell it , otherwise if it does n't smell good i 'm not going to take it as a name . so one , i had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume . and it 's an arabic perfume by the way . and second , my mandate was that i would only launch it with my name for her , if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the friends of cancer patients . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
