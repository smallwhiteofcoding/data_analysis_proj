{"text": "the new york times has rejected an essay that sen. john mccain wrote defending his iraq war policy . sen. john mccain wrote an op-ed for the new york times , but the paper said it could not publish it as written . the piece was in response to an op-ed from sen. barack obama that was published in the paper last week . in an e-mail to the mccain campaign , opinion page editor david shipley said he could not accept the piece as written , but would be  pleased , though , to look at another draft .   let me suggest an approach ,  he wrote friday .  the obama piece worked for me because it offered new information -lrb- it appeared before his speech -rrb- ; while senator obama discussed senator mccain , he also went into detail about his own plans . it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obama 's piece .  read mccain 's rejected piece . in a statement released monday , the new york times said it is  standard procedure on our op-ed page , and that of other newspapers , to go back and forth with an author on his or her submission .   we look forward to publishing senator mccain 's views in our paper just as we have in the past . we have published at least seven op-ed pieces by senator mccain since 1996 . the new york times endorsed senator mccain as the republican candidate in the presidential primaries . we take his views very seriously ,  the statement said . mccain 's rejected op-ed was a lengthy critique of obama 's positions on iraq policy , particularly his view of the surge .  senator obama seems to have learned nothing from recent history ,  wrote mccain , criticizing obama 's call for an early withdrawal timeline .  i find it ironic that he is emulating the worst mistake of the bush administration by waving the ` mission accomplished ' banner prematurely .  watch why the piece was rejected  obama 's july 14 essay had taken shots at mccain for not further encouraging the iraqi government to take control of the country .  instead of seizing the moment and encouraging iraqis to step up , the bush administration and senator mccain are refusing to embrace this transition -- despite their previous commitments to respect the will of iraq 's sovereign government ,  obama wrote in his op-ed .  they call any timetable for the removal of american troops ` surrender , ' even though we would be turning iraq over to a sovereign iraqi government .  read obama 's essay . shipley , who was president bill clinton 's senior speechwriter from 1995 to 1997 , had advised the mccain campaign that  the article would have to articulate , in concrete terms , how senator mccain defines victory in iraq .  it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory -- with troops levels , timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate . and it would need to describe the senator 's afghanistan strategy , spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan .  he added that he hoped the parties could  find a way to bring this to a happy resolution .  mccain spokesman tucker bounds said monday the arizona senator 's position will not change based on the  demands of the new york times .   john mccain believes that victory in iraq must be based on conditions on the ground , not arbitrary timetables ,  he said .  unlike barack obama , that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the new york times .  the newspaper endorsed mccain for the republican presidential nomination in january , shortly before the new york primary . in february , after it became clear mccain would be his party 's presumptive nominee , the paper published a thinly sourced report that mccain once had a close relationship with a female lobbyist . mccain said he was disappointed in the new york times piece . the paper said that it stood by its reporting and that  the story speaks for itself .  mccain 's campaign sent out fundraising appeals based on the article . the article  is particularly disgusting -- an un-sourced hit-and-run smear campaign designed to distract from the issues at stake in this election ,  mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , wrote in a e-mail to supporters .  we need your help to counteract the liberal establishment and fight back against the new york times by making an immediate contribution today ,  the e-mail said in text that linked to an online contribution form on the mccain campaign 's web site .", "summary": "no summary"}
