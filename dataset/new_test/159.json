{"text": "1 . the hamburger -- louis ' lunch , new haven , connecticut . this burger did not come from louis ' so ketchup is ok . there are competing claims for the coveted  inventor of the hamburger  title , but according to louis ' lunch -lrb- and the library of congress , for that matter -rrb- , this small new haven restaurant takes the prize . the story goes something like this : one day in 1900 , a rushed businessman asked owner louis lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run . lassen cooked up a beef patty , put it between some bread , and sent the man on his way . pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all-time , huh ? if you visit louis ' today , you 'll find that not much has changed . the lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant , the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves , and , just like then , there is absolutely no ketchup allowed . 2 . the fried twinkie -- the chipshop , brooklyn , new york . sometimes what counts is n't being the inventor , it 's being the innovator . take the fried twinkie , for example . the twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory -- has been around for ages , but when chipshop owner christopher sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack , dip it in batter , and deep-fry it , the twinkie took gluttony to new heights . even the new york times raved about how  something magical  happens when you taste the deep-fried twinkie 's  luscious vanilla flavor .  sell , who was trained in classical french cuisine , did n't start with the twinkie , though . in his native england , he fried up everything from m&m 's to mars bars . 3 . root beer float -- myers avenue red soda co. , cripple creek , colorado . if you thought what happened up on cripple creek only happened in song , you 're sorely mistaken . in august of 1893 , a failed gold-miner-turned-soda-company-owner named frank j. wisner was drinking a bottle of his myers avenue red root beer while looking up at cow mountain . just then , a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain , and wisner had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer . the new drink was christened the  black cow  and became an instant classic . today , of course , most of us call it a root beer float . 4 . corn dogs -- cozy dog drive in , springfield , illinois . in 1946 , ed waldmire , jr. , revolutionized the stick-meat world when he debuted the cozy dog -- the first corn dog on a stick . at first , he wanted to call his creation the  crusty cur ,  but his wife convinced him to change the name to  cozy dog .  she felt people would n't want to eat something described as  crusty .  good call , mrs. waldmire . shortly after the cozy dog 's inception , the cozy dog drive in opened alongside old route 66 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since . 5 . the pizzeria -- lombardi 's , new york city , new york . pizza has existed in one form or another for a long time , but america got her first true pizzeria when gennaro lombardi opened up a small grocery store in new york city 's little italy . an employee named anthony  totonno  pero started selling pizzas out of the back , and in no time , lombardi 's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries . in 1905 , the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria , and it 's stayed that way ever since . well , almost . the original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later . on its 100th anniversary in 2005 , lombardi 's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it 'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie . needless to say , the line wrapped around the block . 6 . fat darrell -- r.u. hungry , new brunswick , new jersey . you may not know what the fat darrell is , but when you hear what it contains , you 'll understand why it 's truly a work of inspired genius . since 1979 , rutgers university has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the  grease trucks .  originally , they served a sandwich called the fat cat , which contained two cheeseburger patties , french fries , lettuce , tomato , and onions . then one night in 1997 , a hungry -lrb- and broke -rrb- student named darrell w. butler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers , mozzarella sticks , french fries , and marinara sauce on a sandwich . strangely , the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it , and the fat darrell became a mainstay at the grease trucks . hey , not any old sandwich gets to be named maxim magazine 's top  meat hog  sandwich . 7 . philly cheesesteak -- pat 's king of steaks , philadelphia , pennsylvania . philadelphia is known for many things -lrb- ben franklin , the liberty bell , and rocky , for starters -rrb- , but fine dining is not really its forte . that 's ok , though , because philly is the home of pat 's king of steaks , and pat 's king of steaks is where the philly cheesesteak was born . one day back in 1932 , hot dog stand owners pasquale -lrb- pat -rrb- and harry olivieri decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions . a cab driver who ate at pat 's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich , and with the first bite declared ,  hey , forget ` bout those hot dogs , you should sell these !  cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone , so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested . in no time , the modest stand turned into the pat 's that exists today . controversy remains , however , over who 's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak . pat 's claims it was the first to do so -lrb- in 1951 -rrb- , but across-the-street rival joe vento of geno 's steaks -lrb- opened 1966 -rrb- insists he added the finishing touches . 8 . onion rings -- pig stand , dallas , texas . according to most sources , the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a pig stand location in dallas accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter , then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination . now , you 'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain , but not pig stand . the company also lays claim to opening america 's first drive-in , inventing texas toast , and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs . not bad for a little outfit from texas . 9 . derby pie -- melrose inn , prospect , kentucky . a kentucky favorite , derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry-dough crust -- and that 's about all we know about it . why ? because the recipe is jealously guarded by the kern family . melrose inn manager george kern created derby pie in the mid-1950s with help from his parents , walter and leaudra , and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full-time . in fact , mrs. kern , being the crafty monopolist she was , copyrighted the name , and to this day , you can only get real  derby-pie Â®  through kern 's kitchen , inc. . not only that , but a man from new england once handed leaudra a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home . she refused.i e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental
