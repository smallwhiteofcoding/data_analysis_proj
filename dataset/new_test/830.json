{"text": "an estimated 125,000 western lowland gorillas are living in a swamp in equatorial africa , researchers reported tuesday , double the number of the endangered primates thought to survive worldwide . forest clearings draw large numbers of western lowland gorillas searching for food .  it 's pretty astonishing ,  hugo rainey , one of the researchers who conducted the survey for the u.s.-based wildlife conservation society , told cnn tuesday . the last census on the species , carried out during the 1980s , estimated that there were only 100,000 of the gorillas left worldwide . since then , the researchers estimated , the numbers had been cut in half . wcs survey teams conducted the research in 2006 and 2007 , traveling to the remote lac tele community reserve in northern republic of congo , a vast area of swamp forest . acting on a tip from hunters who indicated the presence of gorillas , rainey said that the researchers trekked on foot through mud for three days to the outskirts of lac tele , about 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the nearest road .  when we went there , we found an astonishing amount of gorillas ,  said rainey , speaking from the international primatological society congress in edinburgh , scotland . though researchers did spot some gorillas , they based their estimate on the number of gorilla nests found at the site , rainey said . each gorilla makes a nest to sleep in at night .  this is the highest-known density of gorillas that 's ever been found ,  rainey said . watch a glimpse of gorilla life in african swamp  western lowland gorillas are listed as critically endangered , the highest threat category for a species . their populations are declining rapidly because of hunting and diseases like ebola hemorrhagic fever , whose symptoms include diarrhea , vomiting and internal and external bleeding . take a closer look at the western lowland gorilla  while the discovery in northern congo indicates that the gorilla population remains stable in some areas , it is likely that gorillas will remain critically endangered because the threats facing the species are so great , rainey said . ireport.com : share photos and video of gorillas in zoos or the wild .  we know very little about ebola and how it spreads ,  he said .  we do n't even know the animal that spreads it around .  the goal now , rainey said , is to work with the congolese government and donors to protect the areas in which the gorillas are known to be living . western lowland gorillas , which are found in cameroon , the central african republic , equatorial guinea , gabon and nigeria as well as the republic of congo , are the most numerous and wide-ranging of the four gorilla subspecies , each of which is threatened by extinction , the wcs says . see where the gorillas live  illegal hunting and habitat loss have also threatened the cross river gorillas , found in the highlands of cameroon and nigeria . only about 250 to 300 are estimated to remain in the world , the wcs says . war , habitat loss , poaching and disease are the major threats to the mountain gorillas , made famous by researcher dian fossey and the film  gorillas in the mist .  the mountain gorilla population is starting to recover after decades of conservation work . from a population of around 230 in the 1970s , the mountain gorillas now number around 700 , the wcs says . poaching and war have also threatened populations of grauer 's gorillas in the eastern democratic republic of congo , the former zaire . the wcs estimates their population to be around 16,000 . news of the discovery of the western lowland gorillas in northern congo comes the same week as a report that almost 50 percent of the world 's primates are in danger of extinction . watch what gorilla expert thinks of find  the report , also delivered to the edinburgh conference , cites habitat loss and hunting as the greatest threats . the situation is especially dire in asia , where the report says more than 70 percent of monkeys , apes , and other primates are classified as vulnerable , endangered , or critically endangered . conservation international and the international union for conservation of nature issued the report .", "summary": "no summary"}
