{"text": "washington the united states needs a new law requiring that the president consult with congress before going to war , a blue-ribbon panel led by two former secretaries of state said tuesday . james baker , left , and warren christopher led a panel that recommended a new war powers act . the current war powers resolution is  ineffective , and it should be repealed and it should be replaced ,  james baker said in a joint appearance with warren christopher , announcing the results of the study they led . the recommendation follows failed efforts by democrats in congress to put a stop to the war in iraq or to put conditions on president bush 's conduct of it . congress passed a joint resolution to authorize armed force against iraq in 2002 , but some bush opponents say it should not have been interpreted as a blank check for the united states to invade and occupy the persian gulf nation . baker , who served in george h.w. bush 's administration , and christopher , who served under president bill clinton , said their project was not prompted by any specific war , with christopher adding that the commission had  tried very hard not to call balls and strikes on past history here .   we did n't direct this report at any particular conflict ,  baker added . the existing law , the war powers resolution of 1973 , has been regarded as unconstitutional by every president since it was passed as a response to the vietnam war , baker and christopher said . it requires presidents to report regularly to congress about ongoing conflicts , but the provision has been flouted .  no president has ever made a submission to congress pursuant to the war powers resolution since 1973 ,  former sen. slade gorton , a republican member of the committee , said tuesday . the panel , formally called the national war powers commission , said a new law should be created requiring the president to consult with key members of congress before sending troops into combat expected to last more than a week , or within three days of doing so in the case of operations that need to be kept secret . it should also make clear exactly who the president needed to consult . the panel suggests that the president talk to  a joint congressional committee made up of the leaders of the house and the senate as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees .  the new committee would have a permanent professional staff with access to intelligence information , baker and christopher said . congress , in turn , would have to declare war or vote on a  resolution of approval  within 30 days , they said . if a resolution of approval failed , any member of congress could introduce a  resolution of disapproval ,  but it was not clear that such an act would stop a war in progress . christopher was unable to say in the news conference what practical effect congressional disapproval would have . baker said the commission had been in touch with the presidential campaigns of democrat barack obama and republican john mccain , as well as leaders of congress . he declined to reveal what they thought of the proposal , but said :  we have n't gotten a negative reaction .  congress has not officially declared war since 1942 , when the united states entered formal hostilities with the axis powers in world war ii . but since then , presidents have sent troops into countries including korea , vietnam , grenada and iraq . the constitution makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces , but gives congress the power to declare war and approve military budgets . baker and christopher 's group included both republicans and democrats and held seven meetings over 14 months .", "summary": "no summary"}
