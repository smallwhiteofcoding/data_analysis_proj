{"text": "jeannie longo-ciprelli would be remembered as the greatest female cyclist of her generation even if she had never been an olympic champion . longo-ciprelli : fourth time lucky in atlanta in 1996 . for much of her career , the olympic gold was the one honor to elude the french rider . misfortune , it seemed , was to be her fate every four years , regardless of how many world championships she won in between . in 1984 the first women 's olympic road race coincided with longo-ciprelli 's rise to dominance in the sport . well-placed going into the final lap , she appeared set to challenge in the sprint , only to be knocked off in a collision . by 1988 , longo-ciprelli was a three-time road race world champion , as well as a double winner of the women 's tour de france , and the clear favorite for gold in seoul . but a broken hip a month before the games derailed her preparations . although she recovered enough to ride the road race , she could manage just 21st place . tactical error more disappointment followed in barcelona in 1992 as longo-ciprelli paid the price for a tactical error . with three kilometers to go , she raced away from the peloton and crossed the line in celebration . but she had failed to realize that kathy watt , an unheralded australian , had slipped away from the lead group apparently unnoticed with a lap to go , and finished 20 seconds further in front . four years later , in atlanta , longo-ciprelli , finally cracked her olympic jinx . at 37 , longo-ciprelli was no longer the dominant presence she had once been , but she still possessed the ability to raise her performance for the biggest races , as she had proven by winning her fourth road race world title in 1995 . her preparations were typically unorthodox -- while her rivals were acclimatizing to the atlanta heat , longo-ciprelli trained alone in the mountains of colorado , arriving just two days before the race . the race itself was run in a sudden downpour , which sent many riders crashing and skidding and had the rest struggling to stay on their bikes . unruffled , longo-ciprelli broke clear with two other riders and then launched her gold-winning solo attack 11 kilometers from the finish . longo-ciprelli was back for her fifth and final olympics in sydney in 2000 at the age of 41 , this time claiming bronze in the time trial -- and event in which she had also won silver in 1996 . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
