{"text": "los angeles , california misha di bono zips around town in her infiniti sport-utility vehicle , breezy and unconcerned about the price of gas . misha di bono says people used to make fun of her rolling billboard . she gets $ 500 a month and free gas . that 's because she gets $ 500 a month -- plus free gas -- for turning her car into a rolling billboard for jobing.com , the online recruiting company she works for .  people used to tease me about the ` jobing ' mobile , and now they 're like , ` oh , we 'll get misha to drive , '  she said , standing next to her decal-covered car . jobing.com might be the most extreme example of how companies are helping employees during the current gas crunch . but with gas averaging more than $ 4 a gallon , more and more companies are trying to figure out incentives to help ease the pain at the pump for their employees . watch a rolling billboard for your company   there 's no question companies are feeling the pinch ,  said john challenger , the chief executive officer of global outplacement company challenger , gray and christmas .  it 's an important issue because no company wants to lose its people .  his firm recently surveyed about 100 human resources executives at white-collar and blue-collar companies . the survey found that 57 percent of the companies offer programs to help ease commutes . the most popular option was reducing the work week from five eight-hour days to four 10-hour days . twenty-three percent of the companies polled have such an option , challenger said . calculator : how much do you need to work to pay your gas ?   we 're at a watershed time of how people go to work ,  he said .  maybe the gas crisis will be the real trigger .  other incentives : twenty percent of the companies offer carpools , and 18 percent pay for the cost of public transportation . only 14 percent of the companies offer telecommuting options , the poll found . the survey reports that companies had seen a recent jump in carpooling of 43 percent and a 23 percent increase in the use of public transportation . still , 31 percent of the companies saw no increase in their employees ' commuting behaviors . see gas prices around the country  some of the companies have had the incentives for years , but it 's taken the soaring gas prices for employees to look more closely at the programs .  it 's something that is much more important than two years ago ,  challenger said .  it 's hard to get away from , because you 're constantly going back to the gas station .  he added ,  it 's hitting people 's radar screens now .  one company offering generous commuting benefits is online giant yahoo , which rewards employees who organize carpools , ride bikes to work and take company shuttles to and from offices . yahoo rewards these green-conscious commuters with free movie tickets , lunches , massages and other benefits . ireport : how is your company helping you . the company recently hired an  employee transportation coordinator  to help devise even more incentives .  we 've really been listening to our employees to make sure we help them find ways to make the cost of the commute a little less excessive ,  said barbary brunner , a yahoo vice president . but it is the jobing.com vehicle that is most eye-popping . company spokesman joe cockrell says the company started the rolling billboard cars in 2001 , but only three executives took part in it . but now , 60 percent of its 270 employees nationwide drive the cars . watch a shift from marketing ploy to employee benefit   this year , for the first time , we 've had a long waiting list for our wrap ,  cockrell says .  it 's basically a huge sticker that goes on your car and should last in theory about three to four years .  it costs the company about $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 to turn the cars into rolling billboards . they do have rules : the car ca n't be older than three years , and employees must take a driving safety course and have clean driving records . once the cars are wrapped , employees should n't flip the bird at other drivers . the company did have to  unwrap  one employee 's car because he got too many speeding tickets . cockrell says the program has proved to be a huge win-win .  these are mobile billboards , and wherever our employees go , so does that billboard .  di bono , who works in community relations , says she loves it , too . she says the cost of filling her tank has doubled in recent years . now , her company pays her to drive her car .  they pay for everything ,  she said .  they pay for me to go to all my appointments and anything i want to do on my own time .  she added ,  you 'd be a fool not to take advantage of it .  although many people across the nation are seeking help from their offices , an ireporter in west virginia recently stopped using his company car and began using his old clunker again . maurice alouf 's company paid for his v-8 chrysler sedan , but he says it guzzled gas on his 80-mile round-trip commute . the company did n't offer a gas allowance , and it was costing him more than $ 60 a week to fill up . so he dusted off his 50-mile-per-gallon geo metro .  it 's not fun ,  he said .  i 'd like to keep driving -lsb- the chrysler -rsb- , but i ca n't .
