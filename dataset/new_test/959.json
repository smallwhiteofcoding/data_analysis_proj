{"text": "authorities have re-arrested three men in connection with the disappearance of an alabama teenager in aruba in 2005 , based on new evidence in the case , prosecutors announced wednesday . natalee holloway disappeared while on an aruba vacation in 2005 . brothers deepak and satish kalpoe were arrested in aruba at the same time authorities in the netherlands picked up joran van der sloot at the request of the aruban government , the statement said . van der sloot is attending school in holland . the three had previously been arrested in 2005 , aruban prosecutors noted in a statement , but a court released them , citing insufficient evidence . they are now charged with  involvement in the voluntary manslaughter of natalee holloway or causing serious bodily harm to natalee holloway , resulting in her death ,  the statement said . watch interview with holloway 's father  van der sloot , now 20 , and the kalpoes , now ages 24 and 21 , were the last people seen with holloway , 18 , as she left carlos n ' charlie 's nightclub in oranjestad , aruba , about 1:30 a.m. on may 30 , 2005 . all three men have maintained their innocence in her disappearance . view a timeline of the case  no information was immediately available about what the new evidence was that led to the arrests . aruban prosecutors said a team of detectives from the netherlands has been reviewing the holloway case at the request of authorities in aruba , and had been on the island as late as last month to complete the investigation . the kalpoe brothers were being interrogated by aruban police wednesday , aruba prosecutor dop kruimel told cnn . they will appear before a judge friday for a preliminary arrest hearing , in which the judge determines whether the arrest was credible , she said . the judge can then authorize their being detained for eight more days , meaning police have that much time to produce evidence . the suspects then go before a judge again , she said . van der sloot was arrested in arnhem , the netherlands , by dutch police , kruimel said . aruban authorities have asked for him to be extradited to aruba within eight days . because they were not familiar with the case , dutch police were not questioning van der sloot , she said . he will be questioned when he is brought back to aruba , she said . however , he will appear before a judge thursday in arnhem . when cnn called the kalpoe household , the person who answered the phone hung up . earlier , van der sloot 's mother , anita van der sloot , told cnn her son had not been arrested , but had only reported to a police station in the netherlands for questioning wednesday after receiving a letter asking him to do so . anita van der sloot said she had spoken to her son briefly from her home in aruba . she said a dutch attorney was with him , and she expected him to appear before a judge and be released thursday . meanwhile , a spokeswoman for holloway 's mother , beth holloway , said in a statement ,  the family is always hopeful when a step in the right direction is made in the case .  beth holloway was refusing interviews for now , said spokeswoman sunny tillman . she previously was known as beth holloway-twitty , but has returned to using holloway after a divorce earlier this year . natalee holloway was visiting aruba with a group of about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from mountain brook high school in suburban birmingham , alabama , when she went to carlos n ' charlie 's that night in 2005 . the group had planned to leave for home the following day , and holloway 's packed bags and passport were found in her hotel room after she failed to show up for her flight . her disappearance triggered an exhaustive search and investigation and a media sensation in the united states , aruba , the netherlands and beyond , but holloway has never been found . aruban authorities have been criticized for their handling of the case . at least 10 men , including van der sloot and the kalpoes , have been arrested and identified as suspects either in holloway 's disappearance or in an alleged cover-up . all were questioned and released . legal experts , however , have said differences in the u.s. and aruban systems should be taken into account . aruba 's criminal justice system is based on dutch law and a descendant of the napoleonic code . in aruba , authorities ' reasonable suspicion that someone knows about or is involved in a crime is enough to make an arrest , while magistrates investigate and judges determine a suspect 's guilt or innocence . there are no jury trials . aruban authorities , meanwhile , have suggested that holloway may have overdosed on drugs or died of alcohol poisoning . beth holloway and natalee holloway 's father , dave holloway , filed a lawsuit last year against van der sloot and his father , aruban judge paulus van der sloot , in the supreme court of the state of new york . the van der sloots were served with the suit while on a trip to new york . however , a judge in august 2006 dismissed the suit , saying new york was an inconvenient forum in which to consider it . it was unclear whether holloway 's parents have pursued legal action elsewhere . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's kimberly segal and eric marrapodi contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
