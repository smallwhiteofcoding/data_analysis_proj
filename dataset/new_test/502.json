{"text": "bogota , colombia the commander of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia 's force 47 told reporters in bogota monday -- a day after surrendering -- that  the solution is not through war . there must be dialogue .  nelly avila moreno , center , alias karina , is escorted by soldiers after surrendering . nelly avila moreno , 45 , whose nom de guerre was karina , said she and her longtime male companion made the decision jointly to abandon the farc group , based in the jungle , at 5 a.m. sunday . she said pressure from colombian soldiers had been key to their decision , and she called on her fellow rebels to follow her example .  i invite them to change the sensibility that is among the guerrillas ,  she said , seated by her companion , who said nothing during the news conference . she also had a message for the colombian people :  it is important to do something for peace in colombia , and that need to do something is precisely one of my motivations .  after 24 years with the farc , karina said she wants to reintegrate with society .  at this moment , what i am thinking about is reuniting with my family and with all of society ,  she said . karina said she had had no contact with the group 's leaders for the past two years . during that time , she said ,  i was trying to stay alive .  she said she knows nothing about the group 's leaders , because  everything in the farc is very compartmentalized .  still , she did hear through the news media about the killing by another member of farc of ivan rios , a member of the group 's central high command .  we suffered a very strong blow ,  she said . she acknowledged that news led her to worry about the possibility that one of her fellow guerrillas might consider doing the same thing to her .  a person has a lot of combatants alongside , but you do n't know what each one is thinking ,  she said . asked about news reports of guerrilla operations she may have participated in , karina admitted to nothing .  they accuse me of a lot of things i was n't part of ,  she said . but miguel antonio paez told cnn en espanol that he remembers well the woman who , with a band of guerrillas , stopped the bus he was on in 2004 in northwest colombia , ordered him and the other passengers off and the bus be burned .  the commander of that guerrilla group -- a dark-haired woman , tall , with one eye missing -- called herself karina ,  he said .  she ordered me tied up . here , i have the marks from the wires , and there , while i was tied up , she lopped off my penis and testicles and i remained castrated for all my life .  asked specifically about the killing of the father of president alvaro uribe in 1983 , she said she did not know who carried out the act , and added ,  i do n't have my hands stained in that deed .  she said that with her surrender have come new fears about possible retribution from farc loyalists , who consider her a traitor . wearing a red sweatshirt and what appeared to be a diamond earring in her left ear , she said she once believed the farc would rule colombia .  i once dreamed of that ,  she said . gen. mario montoya , chief of the army , said two colombian air force helicopters were sent sunday to pick up karina and her companion , who had given authorities their general location .  with this , we have given a confounding strike to the farc structure ,  particularly to front 47 , which at this point is practically dismantled ,  he said . since the killing of rios , 45 members of the group have laid down their arms and accepted a government plan for reinstallation into society , he said .  we want to send a message to all members of farc who persist in the mountains ,  he said .  to tell them , what karina has done is the road all the members of farc should go down . if they do n't , we are going to continue combating them . today , more than ever , i invite them to lay down their arms , take the plan . we do n't want them dead . we want them alive .
