{"text": "the national football league has indefinitely suspended atlanta falcons quarterback michael vick without pay , officials with the league said friday . nfl star michael vick is set to appear in court monday . a judge will have the final say on a plea deal . earlier , vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in virginia .  your admitted conduct was not only illegal , but also cruel and reprehensible . your team , the nfl , and nfl fans have all been hurt by your actions ,  nfl commissioner roger goodell said in a letter to vick . goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over . in papers filed friday with a federal court in virginia , vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well . falcons owner arthur blank said vick 's admissions describe actions that are  incomprehensible and unacceptable .  the suspension makes  a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated ,  he said in a statement . watch what led to vick 's suspension  goodell said the falcons could  assert any claims or remedies  to recover $ 22 million of vick 's signing bonus from the 10-year , $ 130 million contract he signed in 2004 , according to the associated press . vick said he would plead guilty to one count of  conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture  in a plea agreement filed at u.s. district court in richmond , virginia . the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine ,  full restitution , a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release ,  the plea deal said . federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines .  the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense ,  the plea agreement said . in an additional summary of facts , signed by vick and filed with the agreement , vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs , but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won .  most of the ` bad newz kennels ' operations and gambling monies were provided by vick ,  the official summary of facts said . gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators tony taylor , quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace , it continued .  vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights . vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by ` bad newz kennels . '  vick also agreed that  collective efforts  by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs . around april , vick , peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vick 's property in virginia , the statement said .  peace , phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in ` testing ' sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods , including hanging and drowning .  vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace , phillips and vick ,  the summary said . peace , 35 , of virginia beach , virginia ; phillips , 28 , of atlanta , georgia ; and taylor , 34 , of hampton , virginia , already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences . vick , 27 , is scheduled to appear monday in court , where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge . see a timeline of the case against vick  the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement . the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy , but vick 's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges , according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin .  it sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior ,  toobin said friday .  the risk for vick is , if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea , the state of virginia could say , ` hey , look , you admitted violating virginia state law as well . we 're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court . '  in the plea deal , vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary . vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests . vick agreed to  make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated  with the dogs that are being held by the government .  such costs may include , but are not limited to , all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case , including if necessary , the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals .  prosecutors , with the support of animal rights activists , have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs . but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted co-conspirators . judge henry e. hudson issued an order thursday telling the u.s. marshals service to  arrest and seize the defendant property , and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property .  both the judge 's order and vick 's filing refer to  approximately  53 pit bull dogs . after vick 's indictment last month , goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons training camp , and the league is reviewing the case . blank told the nfl network on monday he could not speculate on vick 's future as a falcon , at least not until he had seen  a statement of facts  in the case . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mike phelan contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
