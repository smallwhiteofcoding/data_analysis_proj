{"text": "the first pictures from nasa 's mars phoenix lander , which successfully touched down near mars ' north pole sunday , showed a pattern of brown polygons as far as the camera could see . the mars phoenix lander took this image of the planet 's surface at its landing site sunday .  it 's surprisingly close to what we expected and that 's what surprises me most ,  said peter smith , the mission 's principal investigator .  i expected a bigger surprise .  the landing on the red planet 's arctic plains -- which ended a 296-day journey -- was right on target , a feat nasa 's ed weiler compared to landing a hole-in-one with a golf ball from 10,000 miles . the landing -- dubbed the  seven minutes of terror  -- was a nerve-wracking experience for mission managers , who have witnessed the failure of similar missions . in mission control at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , they celebrated the lander 's much-anticipated entry .  it was better than we could have imagined ,  barry goldstein , project manager for the phoenix mission , told cnn . watch the celebration at mission control  the phoenix 's 90-day mission is to analyze the soils and permafrost of mars ' arctic tundra for signs of past or present life . the lander is equipped with a robotic arm capable of scooping up ice and dirt to look for organic evidence that life once existed there , or even exists now .  we are not going to be able to answer the final question of is there life on mars ,  said principal investigator peter smith , an optical scientist with the university of arizona .  we will take the next important step . we 'll find out if there 's organic material associated with this ice in the polar regions . ice is a preserver , and if there ever were organics on mars and they got into that ice , they will still be there today .  the twin to the mars polar lander spacecraft , phoenix was supposed to travel to mars in 2001 as the mars surveyor spacecraft . they were originally part of the  better , faster , cheaper  program , formulated by then-nasa administrator dan goldin to beef up planetary exploration on a lean budget . but polar malfunctioned during its descent into mars ' atmosphere in 1999 and crashed . an investigation concluded that as many as a dozen design flaws or malfunctions doomed the spacecraft . the failure of that mission , as well as another spacecraft called the mars climate orbiter the same year , led to nasa to put future missions on hold and rethink the  better , faster , cheaper  approach . mars surveyor went to the warehouse . watch the challenges the mission faced  but all was not lost . in 2003 , smith proposed a plan to re-engineer the mars surveyor and fly it on a mission to look for signatures of life in the ice and dirt of mars far north . mars phoenix , literally and figuratively , rose from the ashes of surveyor . engineers set to work , testing and retesting the onboard system to ferret out and fix all the flaws they could find . ireport.com : send your photos , video of space .  we always have to be scared to death ,  goldstein said .  the minute we lose fear is the minute that we stop looking for the next problem .  the team was concerned about the phoenix landing system . nasa had not successfully landed a probe on mars using landing legs and stabilizing thrusters since the viking missions in the late 1970s . the other three successful mars landings -- pathfinder in 1997 and the spirit and opportunity rovers in 2004 -- used massive airbags that inflated around the landing craft just before landing to cushion the impact . learn about nasa 's past missions to mars  the phoenix does n't have airbags because the lander is too big and heavy for them to work properly . its landing site was targeted for the far northern plains of mars , near the northern polar ice cap . data from the mars odyssey spacecraft indicate large quantities of ice there , likely in the form of permafrost , either on the surface or just barely underground .  follow the water  has become the unifying theme of nasa 's mars exploration strategy . in 2004 , the rover opportunity found evidence that a salty sea once lapped the shores of an area near mars ' equator called meridiani planum . astrobiologists generally agree that it 's best to look for life in wet places . cnn 's kate tobin contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
