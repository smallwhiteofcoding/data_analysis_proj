{"text": "phoenix , arizona -- new england 's failure to protect star quarterback tom brady proved the decisive factor as the patriots flunked their chance of a perfect 19-0 season and super bowl glory . brady is sacked by defensive end michael strahan in the third guarter of the super bowl . brady has weaved his magic behind an all but impregnable offensive line all season but not on sunday as he was sacked five times in the 17-14 defeat to the new york giants .  they have some great pressure schemes , obviously some great pass rushers ,  brady said .  once we kind of got the idea of what we were doing , i thought we handled it much better , but we did n't get the ball in the end zone enough .  coming in , brady had been sacked a career-low 24 times this season playing behind a line that produced three pro bowlers in koppen , left tackle matt light and left guard logan mankins . throw in right guard stephen neal and right tackle nick kaczur , and brady played most of his record-breaking season not having to worry much about getting hit by bloodthirsty defenders .  i like when i do n't get touched ,  brady said earlier in the week . then , disaster struck -- in the form of an all-out , pressure-packed swarming defensive attack by the giants -- in the worst possible setting . it was the first time brady had been sacked as many as five times since the new york jets did it on sept. 21 , 2003 . new england had no answer for the giants ' bulldozing defense .  if i could tell you , we 'd have it fixed ,  running back kevin faulk said .  at the same time , they outplayed us .  they sure did , and left brady wondering what hit him . brady simply had no time to find randy moss and his other targets on a regular basis against the giants . with 19 seconds left in the game and the patriots facing a do-or-die scenario , brady was sacked for the final time when jay alford pulled him down at new england 's 16-yard line . brady was left with nothing to do but try two straight desperation heaves to moss to no avail .  i think their intensity from the beginning snap to the end of the game was really higher than ours ,  moss said .  we just could n't meet that intensity .  with help from their linemen , the patriots set nfl records for points scored and total touchdowns , while brady broke the league mark for td passes and moss set the record for scoring receptions . that high-powered offense was held to a season-low 14 points in the super bowl -- mostly because it could n't get time .  they played well defensively ,  coach bill belichick said .  they 've been able to rush . they led the league in sacks , they rushed all year . they are a good defensive football team . they played well .   we all could 've done things better tonight ,  brady said . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2008 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
