{"text": "new delhi , india flight attendant sheela joshi is 5 feet , 4 inches and 148 pounds . air india has strict weight parameters that all attendants must meet . when they do n't , the airline grounds them . her employer , air india , says she is too fat to fly . joshi , 50 , has been an air hostess -- as they are still called in india -- for the national airline for 26 years . but she 's been grounded because the airline has done away with its wiggle room on weight . until two years ago , air india allowed an attendant 's weight to vary within 6.6 pounds -lrb- 3 kilograms -rrb- of a specified limit . it has since put in place strict weight parameters that all attendants must meet . when they do n't , the airline grounds them without pay until they shed the excess pounds . the airline says that someone who is sheila 's age , height and weight should weigh 143 pounds -lrb- 65 kilograms -rrb- . she misses the mark by 5 pounds .  it 's very demoralizing ,  joshi told cnn .  and ... it 's quite humiliating .   weight is always on my mind ,  she added .  they can tell you , ` you look overweight . please go . '  joshi and 12 other grounded attendants sued the airline for weight discrimination . air india fought back , saying the employees knew the job requirements when they signed up and did n't express concern . watch airline defend its position  furthermore , it said , appearance and physical fitness are vital parts of an attendant 's job .  -lrb- a -rrb- safety concern is also there ,  said air india 's lawyer , rupinder singh suri .  because it 's a high action job . and in case of emergencies , the person has to accelerate and move at a very , very fast pace .  weight used to be a consideration for airlines in the united states , as well . then , a series of weight-discrimination lawsuits forced carriers to do away with it . now  most airlines want candidates with weight proportionate to height ,  according to the u.s. labor department 's occupational outlook handbook . in the india case , the airline has n't deemed any of the attendants medically unfit -- just over the weight limit . their attorney contends the move is actually about getting rid of older , well-compensated women in favor of younger ones who will do the job for less money .  they have spent their entire life working for indian airlines ,  said lawyer arvind sharma .  they were small girls when they came in now . they are 45-plus and they feel bad .  the delhi high court recently sided with air india in the case . joshi 's attorney has vowed to appeal to the supreme court . in the meantime , joshi and some of her colleagues say they are n't taking any chances . they are going on diets to get airborne again .", "summary": "no summary"}
