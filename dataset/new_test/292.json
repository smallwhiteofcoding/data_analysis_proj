{"text": "washington the u.s. navy has moved the guided-missile destroyer uss cole and other ships to the eastern mediterranean sea off lebanon , pentagon officials said thursday . a file image of the uss cole , which the u.s. navy moved to the mediterranean sea off lebanon . the deployment comes amid a political standoff over lebanon 's presidency , but the navy would not say whether the events are linked .  it 's a group of ships that will operate in the vicinity for a while and as the ships in our navy do , the presence is important ,  adm. mike mullen , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , said thursday .  it is n't meant to send any stronger signal than that ,  he said .  but it does signal that we 're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity , and that 's a very important part of the world .  the cole was badly damaged by an al qaeda bombing during a port call in yemen in 2000 , killing 17 sailors . it returned to service in 2002 . the destroyer and two support ships are close to lebanon but out of visual range of the coast , pentagon officials said . another six vessels , led by the amphibious assault ship uss nassau , are close to italy and steaming toward the other three , the officials said . mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president , which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week . but he said the vote was  important ,  and washington was waiting for it to take place . and a bush administration official told cnn the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboringsyria that  the u.s. is concerned about the situation in lebanon , and we want to see the situation resolved .   we are sending a clear message for the need for stability ,  said the official , who was not authorized to speak for publication . the ships  should be there a while ,  the official added . lebanon 's pro-western majority in parliament and the pro-syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years . the country has been without a president since november , when pro-syrian leader emile lahoud 's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement . despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief gen. michel suleiman , disagreements over how to share power in a future cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote . parliament speaker nabih berri 's office announced tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to march 11 . berri 's office said the arab league needed more time to break the deadlock . lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri , whose supporters blamed damascus for his killing . the resulting outcry eventually drove syrian forces out of lebanon , where they had been stationed since the 1970s . e-mail to a friend . cnn correspondent zain verjee contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
