{"text": "copenhagen , denamrk what makes someone decide to become an actor ? it sometimes seems as if the average hollywood star is motivated mainly by the promise of a fat pay check . connie nielsen shot to fame playing lucilla in  gladiator .  or perhaps they 're drawn to the celebrity lifestyle . maybe they crave the love of an adoring public , or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world , to be immortalized on celluloid . for danish actress connie nielsen it was something quite different . for her , being an actor means being an outsider .  as an artist you actually do have to make a choice to be an outsider . if you 're an outsider you have the freedom to say what people on the inside do n't dare to say ,  she told cnn . so connie nielsen is not your typical movie star . as a 5-foot-10-inch blonde scandinavian beauty she has the looks of a classic silver screen siren , but she has steadfastly resisted a career as hollywood eye candy and rejected the lifestyle that goes with it .  i absolutely refuse the fame part of my business ,  she says .  i refuse even the money side of my business . i try to do as good work as i can do , i try to grow in my art and reach for truth ,  she says . raised in elling , a small coastal village in denmark , she is fluent in seven languages and studied acting in france and italy , making her screen debut in french comedy  par où t'es rentré ? on t ' a pas vu sortir  -lrb- u.s. title  how did you get in ? we did n't see you leave  -rrb- in 1984 . she appeared in more french and italian movies before landing a role opposite al pacino and keanu reeves in  the devil 's advocate  in 1997 . but it was n't until 2000 , when she was cast in ridley scott 's oscar-winning  gladiator  , that nielsen landed a role that really let her show her acting ability . as lucilla , the sister of the villainous emperor commodus , nielsen brought some much-needed subtlety to the swords-and-sandals epic and held her own sharing the screen with joaquin phoenix and russell crowe . the movie made nielsen an international star and she scored other successes with  one hour photo  in 2002 , and  the hunted  in 2003 . but while the success of  gladiator  opened doors for her , it also meant she had to fight the kind of typecasting that would try to limit her to playing  the love interest  to a male lead who got all the good lines . nielsen has in the past been critical of hollywood for its lack of female roles , saying  you think once you 've shown what you can do , and your movies have been successful , that snap , you work . so to discover the difference between guys ' roles and girls ' roles made me plain mad . it 's unjust .  but nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed , seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies . she appeared in french movie  demonlover  , which dealt with pornography , violence and corporate amorality , while more recent films have taken on the wars in afghanistan and iraq . danish drama  brødre  -lrb- u.s. title  brothers  -rrb- is about a soldier who returns from afghanistan a broken man , unable to communicate his experiences from the conflict . playing his wife , nielsen put in a powerful performance that won her awards and served to highlight how hollywood had underused her talents .  the situation  in 2006 was billed as the first film to be made about the iraq war and told the story of ordinary iraqis caught up in the conflict , while  battle of seattle  examined how peaceful protests erupted into riots when the world trade organization met in seattle in 1999 . of her choice of subject matter , nielsen says that rather than making a political point she is trying to show the human aspects of the conflicts . but nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies . she is passionate about literature and art and she is currently dating lars ulrich , drummer of rock group metallica . she had a son with him in 2007 and has another son from a previous relationship .  i will always find something that i want to try and become better at . i always love to spend more time with my friends , more time with my family , my extended family . i always want to read more books ,  she says . perhaps her commitment to her art , her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her danish upbringing , but there 's no doubt that compared to many other hollywood stars connie nielsen is a breath of fresh air .", "summary": "no summary"}
