{"text": "seoul , south korea south korea will open its market to most u.s. beef , a senior government official said thursday , according to state media . thousands of people have taken to the streets of the south korean capital in protest at the deal . south korea banned imports of u.s. beef in 2003 amid concerns over a case of mad cow disease in the united states . the ban closed what was then the third-largest market for u.s. beef exporters . it resumed limited imports last year -- allowing boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age -- but that re-opening was subject to interruptions and closed altogether in october 2007 . a deal that south korea and the united states struck last month bans the import of high-risk materials , like tonsils , brains , spinal cord marrow and a section of the small intestine , agriculture minister chung woon-chun said thursday , according to south korea 's yonhap news agency . these parts pose the greatest risk of transmitting mad cow disease to humans . the ban will be lifted within a few days , once the government 's new import rules have been published . the pending resumption of u.s. beef imports has n't been without political costs for president lee myung-bak . he apologized to the nation last week for failing to fully understand concerns about mad cow disease . in downtown seoul , thousands of people have regularly staged protests , chanting  we do n't want crazy cows ,  since the deal to revive beef imports was announced . and the main opposition party has taken up the fight .  we will be forced to make a critical decision if the government pushes through its plan to announce resumption of beef imports ,  said sohn hak-kyu , leader of the main opposition united democratic party , yonhap reported .  if the government and the ruling party ignore this warning , we will come up with every possible measure to stop them .  the opposition has already filed a suit to suspend implementation of new beef import terms , according to yonhap . lee 's ruling grand national party -lrb- gnp -rrb- is working to soothe tensions , saying that american beef is safe to eat and that adequate safety precautions have been taken .  the government has tried its best to free the public from unnecessary concerns , and sufficient countermeasures have been prepared ,  said lee hahn-koo , the party 's chief policymaker , yonhap reported . when south korea and the united states reached the deal in april to re-open the south korean market , they removed the major obstacle to u.s. congressional approval of the korea-u.s. free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- . lee urged the national assembly this month to ratify the agreement as soon as possible to provide fresh impetus to the sluggish korean economy , saying it will create 300,000 jobs . but the opposition has promised to fight the fta until the beef pact is nullified . in 2003 , the united states exported $ 815 million pounds of beef and beef variety meats to south korea . the u.s. beef industry has lost up to $ 4 billion since the market closed , according to the u.s. meat export federation .", "summary": "no summary"}
