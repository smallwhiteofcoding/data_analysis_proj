{"text": "if someone had asked kelly pless to describe herself three years ago , the word  fit  would have never crossed her mind . kelly pless weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest . she lost 95 pounds through diet and exercise . for most of her adult life , the 31-year-old graduate student from sunny isles beach , florida , has struggled with her weight . she started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school , she was carrying 215 pounds on her 5 ' 2  frame . prom , she says , was a nightmare .  i had to go to three different stores to buy a dress ,  pless said .  i had to buy the biggest , also the ugliest , prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit .  after high school , she lost 50 pounds . but because she had n't done it in a healthy way , her weight crept back up to 220 pounds . at 28 , she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame . she reached her breaking point .  i remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just was n't something i could be ,  said pless .  i remember feeling like even if i tried , it was n't something my body was capable of .  despite her doubts , pless decided to do something . fortunately she did n't have to look far for inspiration . see before and after weight loss photos from cnn.com i-reporters   my manager at the kennedy space center ran marathons , and he was the same age as my father ,  she said . because her own father had diabetes and was in poor health , he seemed much older , she said . over the next three to four months , she began walking , without any real goal or expectation . pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more , everything would fall into place .  at first , it was hard to start exercising because i was worried people would make fun of me ,  pless said .  but then i just told myself , if that 's the worst that could happen ... i just got out there and did n't care .  eventually , she started to run or  shuffle  as she jokingly recalls . she also adopted an  eat to live  philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit .  i changed how i felt about food and what it meant to me ,  said pless , who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate .  one of the first things i cut out was cakes and cookies . that was my weak spot . after a few months of cutting those things out , i focused more on portion control ,  said pless .  i pretty much eat when i 'm hungry and do n't eat when i 'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are . make sure i 'm not eating out of boredom or -lsb- at -rsb- social events , i try to make sure i 'm not overeating , just because everyone else is .  kelly pless shares her weight loss secrets  pless pays close attention to societal pressure , which she believes is the reason many people overeat . restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size , she says . she makes sure she does n't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there .  what 's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that are n't necessarily good for you , or actually change how you look at food . that was the hardest part for me .  instead of giving in to the temptation or convenience of calorie-laden or fatty foods such as cheeseburgers from the drive-through , pless asks herself ,  what do i really want to eat ? or , what does my body really want right now ?  all of the hard work and determination paid off . pless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1 1/2 years . as a result , she says , she 's healthier and more confident . she 's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders .  -lsb- the -rsb- negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently . being fat was a good filter -- i 'm automatically treated better by people because i 'm thinner . society is so hard on people who are overweight or obese ,  said pless .  now , those people think i 'm funnier or smarter .  pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter . the first is in november in las vegas , nevada , and the second is in miami , florida , in january . forty pounds ago , the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin . but now , she said she ca n't imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require .  running has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight , which is now about 125 pounds ,  said pless . if her past is any indication of her future success , pless will certainly cross the finish line . i-report : have you lost weight ? share your story , tips and photos e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
