{"text": "madrid , spain the search is back on for words to the spanish national anthem . spain 's basketball team : able to hum the national anthem , but not sing words . the lack of lyrics in spain 's anthem has long created awkward moments for winning spanish athletes at the olympics . they stand on the podium silently or hum along while winning athletes from other nations sing when their anthem is played during their moment of triumph . with the summer olympic games fast-approaching , the spanish olympic committee stirred the lyric-writing impulses of spaniards by sponsoring a competition to provide words for the anthem . the contest drew 7,000 entries , and an expert panel selected a winner . the committee announced plans for renowned spanish tenor placido domingo to sing the lyrics on monday . then , suddenly , the committee discarded the winning lyrics .  once spaniards heard these lyrics , they sparked a lot of controversy , even rejection ,  alejandro blanco , president of the spanish olympic committee , told a packed news conference this week . the now-discarded winning lyrics had begun with ,  viva espana ,  or  long-live spain ,  and critics complained that phrase harkened back to the right-wing dictatorship of general francisco franco , who led a military uprising in 1936 against the elected government and won a civil war , ruling spain until his death in 1975 .  you have to consider that many spaniards do n't consider the national anthem as their own . it was played a lot under franco ,  said margarita saenz-diez , a journalist . spain is now a democracy , but many still bristle at the military march that 's served for more than two centuries as the national anthem . spain is made up of many different peoples , and five languages are spoken across the country . the catalans in the northeast and the basques in the north already have their own national songs with lyrics . getting agreement on any lyrics to the national anthem is no easy task and would ultimately have to be approved by parliament . the president of the spanish olympic committee conceded he does n't know when there will be lyrics for the anthem , and many here say there is n't enough time to get lyrics approved before the aug. 8 start of the summer olympic games in beijing . yet the search goes on .  we will continue with the idea of an anthem with lyrics ,  blanco said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's al goodman contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
