{"text": "the amazon rainforest is so vast and full of life that even its defenders do n't know exactly what it is they are protecting . in the past 40 years , roughly 20 percent of the amazon rainforest has been wiped out .  the wealth of biodiversity is so immense , we can not even estimate the amount we do n't know ,  says cl√°udio c. maretti , brazil-based director for conservation for the world wildlife fund .  every new expedition you do to the amazon , you might find one new species of fish . every other , you might find some new bird or frog .  the amazon rainforest , which encompasses an area nearly as large as the continental united states and stretches across nine countries , is considered the world 's richest and most varied natural habitat , with several million species of insects , plants , birds and fish calling it home . it also plays an important role in regulating earth 's temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air . but the amazon has been under pressure from outside forces for decades . in the past 40 years , roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out . maretti says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees .  we have been deforesting at enormous rates ,  maretti says . the chief drivers of this deforestation are large-scale business interests involved in logging , mining , agriculture and , especially , cattle ranching . some of this activity is sanctioned by the government ; much of it is not . greenpeace estimates as much as 80 percent of the logging is illegal . the amazon rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction . the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations estimates that 50,000 square miles of forest -- more than three times the size of switzerland -- are lost each year because of clearing and degradation . the threat is particularly acute in the more tropical areas of south america , africa and southeast asia . cambodia , for example , lost nearly 30 percent of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005 , according to fao . vietnam lost close to 55 percent of its primary forests , fao found . and nigeria lost nearly 56 percent of its primary forests over the same period , the worst rate of forest loss in the world , according to fao . the destruction of the earth 's oldest and richest forests is not a new phenomenon , but the rate of destruction has increased in recent decades .  worldwide , one-half of all forests we 've lost in the last 10,000 years has occurred in the last 80 years . half of that was destroyed in the last 30 years ,  says scott paul , forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace . paul says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market , not to meet local needs .  the timber market , and also for agriculture , mining : when it plugs into the international economic system , that 's when you 've got to watch it ,  he says . paul would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product they 're consuming was harvested .  if you buy wine and cheese , we can tell the region and the year . but forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side . there is no way to determine if something came from a well-managed forest or an illegal forest where there is slavery , murder , drug trade , etc. ,  he says . while the story of the world 's old-growth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction , forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas , such as the northeast region of the united states and parts of europe . this thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species .  northern new england is the only place in the eastern united states where you have the potential for large-scale wilderness where wolves , lynxes , cougars , woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored ,  according to michael j. kellett , executive director of restore : the north woods .  we could literally have almost the entire ecosystem of the maine woods as it once was .  with large-scale agriculture all but gone from new england and logging companies concentrating their attention elsewhere , kellett 's biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of maine . his proposed solution : create a national park . in brazil in recent years , the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the amazon 's destruction . last october , brazil said the rate of deforestation plunged 41 percent because of the enforcement of environmental laws . environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of brazil 's currency against the dollar , making the country 's exports more expensive . the world wildlife fund 's maretti is hopeful that brazil , with international help , will be able to protect even more of the amazon , an area he considers among the most vital natural habitats in the world .  we do have strong civil society . we do have more governance ,  maretti says .  but we certainly need support from abroad . i do n't believe brazil can do this job alone .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
