{"text": "new zealand warmed up for their tri-nations decider against australia with a 101-14 rout of samoa in a one-off rugby union test on wednesday in new plymouth , running in 15 tries . conrad smith touches down for one of his two tries in the all blacks win . fullback mils muliaina scored three tries in the first half , center conrad smith and winger richard kahui touched down twice and nine other players added their names to the new zealand scoresheet as the all blacks beat a weakened samoan team by a record margin . new zealand led 47-7 , seven tries to one , at halftime and added eight tries , including a penalty try , in the second spell to surpass their highest score against samoa . the all blacks had a 26-0 lead after 16 minutes and set their record score against samoa -- surpassing the 71-13 in 1999 -- despite being held scoreless for periods of 18 minutes in the first half and 10 minutes in the second . it was the fifth time new zealand had reached 100 points in a match , with the all blacks ' record being the 145-17 win over japan at the 1995 world cup . samoa was forced to pick a severely under-strength side because many of its leading and most-experienced players are involved with european club sides . most of the players who took the field wednesday were young and samoa-based and playing against the all blacks for the first time . although outgunned by an all blacks team which overwhelmingly controlled territory and possession , samoa played with great spirit and scored a try in each half . flyhalf uale mai scored and converted his own try after 28 minutes and flanker alafoti faosiliva touched down off a break by uale mai four minutes before fulltime .  what can you say ? 100 points ,  samoa captain filipo levi said .  it shows the all blacks are on fire at the moment . they 've showed in the tri-nations competition that they 're a very consistent team .  for some of our boys it was a big step up from playing club rugby in samoa but , having said that , it was a big learning curve .  flyhalf daniel carter converted six of the all blacks ' first-half tries , surpassing 2,000 points in first-class rugby , and his replacement stephen donald scored his first test try and converted seven of new zealand 's eight second-half tries . the match was scheduled to help the all blacks bridge the three-week gap between their most recent tri-nations clash with south africa and their next , against australia , at brisbane on september 13 . the brisbane match will decide the outcome of the tri-nations tournament . copyright 2008 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
