{"text": "washington the bush administration hailed north korea 's declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with south korea , china , japan and russia . workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at north korea 's yongbyon nuclear facility this year . in fact , north korea 's confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at yongbyon -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing north korea 's nuclear program . as a result of pyongyang 's handover of the 60-page declaration document -- and friday 's expected destruction of the cooling tower at yongbyon -- president bush ordered some sanctions against north korea lifted and instructed the state department to remove the reclusive communist nation from u.s. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism . but as important as what the document says is what it does n't say . there is no mention of how many weapons north korea has or where they are hidden . nor did north korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with syria . both issues are reduced in the declaration to  concerns  pyongyang promises to address down the road . bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice have pledged a robust verification process to double-check north korea 's claims . and north korea has promised to allow u.s. inspectors access to the yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts . but it is far from clear whether pyongyang will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the united states will need to get a complete picture of north korea 's program . congressional republicans not so sure about pyongyang . the stiffest opposition to the deal is coming from conservative republicans . once considered president bush 's strongest allies in confronting north korea 's nuclear ambition , they feel that the bush administration has let north korea off the hook , especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to syria . rep. ileana ros-lehtinen , r-florida , the top republican on the foreign affairs committee , expressed  profound disappointment  over bush 's announcement that north korea would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism . and rep. pete hoekstra , r-michigan , the top republican on the permanent select committee on intelligence , accused president bush of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success .  a decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the white house to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of north korea 's nuclear efforts ,  hoekstra said .  lifting sanctions and removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures .  rep. ed royce , r-california , called north korea 's declaration late and incomplete , alleging that north korea built a nuclear facility for syria , considered a terrorist state by the united states , while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing . that , he said , was proof that pyongyang ca n't be trusted .  how do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you have ?  royce asked .  this is a signal to other proliferating regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up .  democrats , who once criticized bush for not talking directly to north korea about its nuclear program , are cautiously supportive of the deal . howard berman , the democratic chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , called the north 's submission of a declaration  encouraging .  even former presidential candidate sen. john kerry , d-massachusetts , praised the bush administration , saying  engaging our enemies can pay dividends .  but kerry added ,  historians will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage north korea before pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons , tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them .  are we headed down the same road with iran ? in his 2002 state of the union address , bush termed iraq , north korea and iran the  axis of evil ,  saying they were  arming to threaten the peace of the world .  fourteen months after delivering that speech -- and after dictator saddam hussein released a 12,000-page declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction -- u.s. forces invaded iraq . but no such program was found , nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction . more than five years into the war , the united states is still battling al qaeda and iraqi insurgents there . six-party talks with north korea began in 2003 , after north korea withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . progress was limited until 2007 , when north korea agreed to shut down yongbyon and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and verification . progress has been even more limited for the third member of the  axis of evil ,  iran . the bush administration has joined the other members of the u.n. security council -- britain , france , china and russia , along with germany -- in offering iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones north korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program . but the united states has refused to sit down with iran until that suspension takes place . the u.n. security council has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against iran , and the united states has worked with some success to isolate iran from the international financial community . but unlike north korea , which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid , iran is rich in oil and a powerful force in the middle east . and it 's only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices skyrocket . and iran seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new u.s. president . sen. barack obama , the presumptive democratic nominee , has pledged to engage iran in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions . sen. john mccain , the presumptive gop nominee , has taken a much tougher line , refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nuclear-armed iran . with the coming change in the u.s. administration , u.s. officials , diplomats and other iran experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the united states and iran could seriously think about talking . meanwhile , by its own admission , iran continues to perfect its nuclear technology . if the north korean experience can serve as a lesson for the next u.s. president , that lesson may well be that the longer the united states waits to talk to iran , the higher the cost will be to get tehran out of the nuclear business .", "summary": "no summary"}
