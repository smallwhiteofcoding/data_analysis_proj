{"text": "donetsk , ukraine a frail irene famulak clutched her brother on the airport tarmac , her arm wrapped around him in a tight embrace , tears streaming down their faces . it was the first time since 1942 they had seen each other , when she was 17 and he was just 7 . siblings wssewolod galezkij and irene famulak were separated in 1942 when nazis took her to a labor camp . that was the night the invading nazis came to take her away from her ukrainian home .  i remember it well because i kissed him good-bye , and he pushed me away ,  she said of her brother .  i asked , ` why did you do that ? ' and he said that he does n't like kisses .   the nazis told my mother that i was being taken to work in a german labor camp for six months . but it was , of course , much longer . i was there for years .  both siblings survived the holocaust and grew up on different sides of the iron curtain , not knowing the fate of the other . but after 66 years apart , famulak , 83 , was reunited with her long lost 73-year-old brother , wssewolod galezkij . they held each other close this time , cherishing the moment . watch siblings hug for first time in seven decades   i do n't believe anyone has ever known such happiness . now , i truly believe i can die satisfied ,  galezkij said . famulak made the long journey to donetsk in eastern ukraine from philadelphia , pennsylvania , after being contacted by the american red cross . the organization told her they had located her only surviving sibling . famulak said she spent world war ii in a labor camp in munich , germany , working in the kitchens . she had been taken to the camp with her older sister . when it was liberated in 1945 , famulak stayed in germany for several years , eventually emigrating to the united states in 1956 . she never saw her parents again after that day in 1942 when nazis separated her from her family . she and her brother still have no idea what happened to their mother and father . some of their siblings lived through the war , but later died ; others , they never heard from again after being separated . but her younger brother never gave up hope of tracking his sister down . he , too , was sent to a german labor camp , but after the war , he moved back to ukraine , then a republic of the soviet union . see photos of the  needle in haystack  reunion  under soviet leader josef stalin , information on lost relatives was kept sealed , and galezkij said it was n't until reforms in the late 1980s , followed by the soviet collapse , that he started making progress in finding his sister . even then , it took him more than 17 years to locate her in the united states . he broke down in tears as he spoke of his overwhelming happiness at finding her .  when the red cross told me they had found her in america , it was such a joy ,  he said , sobbing . in fact , he had to be taken to the hospital because he was so overcome when he first learned she was alive . at this week 's reunion , there was a doctor on hand at the airport as a precaution . back in the united states , there were tears , too . linda klein , the director of the american red cross holocaust and war victims tracing center , said the volunteer who helped the siblings find each other got caught up in the emotion herself .  when i showed her the picture , she stood there and wept ,  klein said .  she was beside herself .  klein 's group has reunited 1,500 families since it began work in 1990 . she said the former soviet union released records in 1989 of concentration camps it liberated , greatly helping organizers find information on holocaust victims . the organization has 100 volunteers -- a third of them holocaust survivors , klein said . the group also helps families find information about their loved ones who died during the holocaust . they have brought together more than 50 families this year . all of their work is free . she says it 's often like  looking for a needle in a haystack .   we 're playing beat the clock right now ,  she said , adding ,  it 's about families that one day they were together and then they were apart .   when a connection is made , there are just smiles all around .  that was the case for this family in ukraine . years of trauma , of separation , of not knowing what happened to loved ones , have been replaced by celebration . in a picturesque orchard overlooking rolling fields , galezkij , his wife and their neighbors laid out a feast for his american sister . as the vodka flowed , he told her how he had survived for a lifetime without her .  he says he always thought he 'd see me someday . he dreamt lots about me ,  famulak said , as she sat next to her brother .  and he wrote a song for me . when he went to sleep , he sang every night and cried .  with that , galezkij , weakened by illness and age , burst into song . but this time , he sang the words with pure joy . cnn 's michael sefanov and wayne drash contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
