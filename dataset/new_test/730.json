{"text": "washington the director of federal emergency management agency on sunday defended giving away an estimated $ 85 million in hurricane relief supplies , blaming louisiana officials for turning down the stockpiles . a new orleans charity keeps goods in trash bags in an empty church . fema never told it about the free items .  we still have quite a few left if louisiana needs those ,  david paulison said .  but we did find out , we did ask louisiana , ` do you want these ? ' they said , ` no , we do n't need them . ' so we offered them to the other states .  a cnn investigation revealed last week that fema gave away 121 truckloads of material the agency amassed after 2005 's hurricane katrina . the material was declared surplus property and offered to federal and state agencies -- including louisiana , where groups working to resettle hurricane victims say the supplies are still needed . paulison told cnn 's  late edition with wolf blitzer  his agency distributed more than 90,000  living kits  to people in louisiana whose homes were destroyed or damaged by katrina . the kits included cleaning supplies , mops , brooms , pots and pans . after cnn reported on the giveaway , louisiana officials asked that the supplies be redirected to the state , which originally passed on them . john medica , director of the louisiana 's federal property assistance agency , told cnn he was unaware katrina victims still needed the items because no agency had contacted his office . sen. mary landrieu of louisiana , an outspoken critic of fema 's response to the hurricane , told cnn the supply giveaway was  just a shame .   it 's just another example of the failings of the federal bureaucracy ,  said landrieu , who wrote homeland security secretary michael chertoff last week to request an explanation .  we 're still trying to fix it . it 's going to take a lot more work .  paulison said much of the stockpile included  things we do n't normally store -- refrigerators , stoves , coolers , diapers , things like that .  states , meanwhile , were requesting those items , he said .  it did n't make any sense for fema to sit on this much stuff and supplies we normally do n't even keep . we have plenty of supplies in place if we have another disaster . we can duplicate that type of commodities and get them for people in need ,  he said . the agency 's chief spokesman , james mcintyre , had declined a request for an on-camera interview and told cnn the giveaway was  not news .  paulison said the story  just really missed the mark  -- that the supplies given away were not exclusively for katrina victims , but were  donated from disasters all around the entire country .  but e-mails from mcintyre and from the general services administration , which manages federal property , contradict paulison 's account . in an e-mail sent in april , mcintyre told cnn  in many cases , items were purchased in the field by fema .  and in a phone interview with cnn , mcintyre said ,  that is property that was purchased in response to katrina . we purchased most of that equipment because of the catastrophic nature of that disaster .  general services administration spokeswoman viki reath wrote the supplies given away were  surplus from the katrina and -lsb- hurricane -rsb- rita disasters ... some purchased by fema , some donated by foreign countries and federal government agencies .  mcintyre said fema 's storage costs were running more than $ 1 million a year , and that gsa officials wanted to tear down the fort worth , texas , warehouses in which the stockpiles were being kept . cnn 's abbie boudreau and scott zamost contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
