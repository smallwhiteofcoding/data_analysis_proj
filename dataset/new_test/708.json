{"text": "starting a legitimate business is hard , boring work . there 's paperwork to fill out , employees to hire , and all sorts of other drudgery , not to mention the biggest hurdle of all : providing a product or service for which customers are willing to pay . president ulysses s. grant foiled a gold scam . in all likelihood , it would be much easier to just stumble upon some clever scam to line your pockets . or so it would seem . as many aspiring scam artists quickly learn , when a business scam fails , it tends to fail in rather grand fashion . just ask any of these four teams of not-so-smooth operators . a corny sea story . xenothemis and hegestratos may not have been the world 's first white-collar criminals , but they were certainly noteworthy for their incompetence . in 360 b.c. , the pair stumbled upon what seemed like a killer plan to make some quick cash . shipping was extremely risky at the time , and boats went down at sea with alarming frequency . to exploit this uncertainty , xenothemis and hegestratos devised a plan in which they would receive a cash advance to ship a load of corn from syracuse to athens . due to the dangers associated with shipping , the buyer would take on full risk if the shipment did n't make it to athens , so if the boat sank xenothemis and hegestratos could keep their cash . instead of loading the ship with expensive corn , the conniving pair made a plan to sail an empty ship out to sea for a few days , then sink it and escape in lifeboats . since the boat itself was insured , this plot seemed airtight , and the potential profit was great . unfortunately , though , the boat 's other passengers allegedly caught wind of the scheme during the attempting scuttling of the ship . these passengers were understandably a bit peeved at hegestratos ' attempts to drown them for his own financial gain . hegestratos panicked and jumped overboard , at which point he drowned . unable to sink the ship by himself , xenothemis had to sail on to the port , at which point the buyer , protos , wanted to know why his shipload of corn was empty . a legal battle followed , and although the verdict has been lost by history , it 's safe to say that the late hegestratos regretted the scam . when friday went black . despite his prowess as a general , ulysses s. grant 's presidency did n't go so smoothly . ones of its most notable scandals occurred in 1869 , when a group of speculators upended the u.s gold market . the plan started when financier james fisk and robber baron jay gould formed a group of speculators with the goal of cornering the gold market , which would give the group the ability to manipulate the price . of course , one can only corner the market if there 's a fixed quantity of gold available . otherwise , the government could just sell large quantities of gold , and the cornering effort would be an expensive failure . in an effort to avoid this fate , gould and fisk brought president grant 's brother-in-law abel corbin into their fold . using corbin 's influence to get an audience with the president , the pair would argue to grant that selling gold was a terrible idea that the government should avoid at all costs . the wily pair also used their influence at the white house to secure a position as assistant treasurer of the united states for daniel butterfield , who would warn them if the government started to sell gold . with their connections in place , fisk and gould started buying up gold in september 1869 , quickly driving the price of gold up by around 30 percent . once grant and his advisors got wise to the situation , though , the government quickly sold off $ 4 million in gold to break the corner , effectively killing the inflated prices on september 24 . as investors scrambled to get rid of their overpriced gold , the price plummeted sharply , and many involved in the scam lost huge amounts of money . fisk and gould managed to avoid big losses due to their connections in the treasury , but what would be known as black friday did n't earn them a huge windfall -- and significantly harmed the american economy . bad moves . if you 've ever hired movers , you know it can be pretty pricey . erik deri , the founder of woodinville , washington-based nationwide moving systems , understood that most movers were expensive , so he drummed up business by offering super-cheap quotes to frugal clients . the customers were ecstatic to find a mover who could get their belongings to a new home so cheaply . that is , until the price went up . deri 's movers would load the company 's vans with all of a customer 's worldly belongings , then a foreman would inform the client that they 'd have to pay an inflated price to actually get their stuff to their new digs . the price hikes were n't small , either ; one man 's estimate stated he could move for $ 3,000 but was later revised to $ 16,000 after loading . according to authorities , if customers balked at these demands , the movers would threaten to unload their boxes and furniture into the street ... and then charge them an unloading fee . if things got really sticky , nationwide 's trucks could just take off with all of the clients ' possessions . deri supposedly paid cash bonuses to employees who successfully strong-armed customers into forking over the premiums . in the end , though , deri learned that you ca n't scam that many customers and hope to get away with it . in 2005 he was found guilty of 27 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion . three of his accomplices were also convicted in connection with the moving racket . deri was sentenced to seven years in prison , after which he 'll face deportation to his native israel . fools for gold . bre-x minerals ltd. was a small canadian mining company that made a big announcement in 1995 . geologists had discovered gold on a site bre-x owned near busang , indonesia . not just a little gold , either -- at least 30 million ounces , possibly as much as 200 million ounces . given the high prices of gold , such a deposit would have been worth tens of billions of dollars . bre-x 's stock price shot through the roof ; shares went from being valued at a few cents to over $ 280 canadian . in fact , the deposit seemed so rich and so large that a small company like bre-x could not possibly handle it all without some help . in 1997 , the indonesian government convinced bre-x to take on an american firm as a partner to help extract the gold . when this firm , freeport-mcmoran , started sampling the soil at the deposit site as part of its due diligence , it reached a confusing conclusion : there was n't any gold in the soil . subsequent examinations by independent auditors reached the same conclusion . the  natural  gold that in the original samples bre-x had taken was mostly river gold from other regions or shavings off of gold jewelry . although the company 's market cap had climbed to $ 4.4 billion , this report quickly destroyed bre-x 's value . share prices dropped 97 percent in a day following the announcement , the company was soon removed from the toronto stock exchange and nasdaq , and bre-x quickly went bankrupt . amazingly , no one ended up in jail from this scam , but you should still probably be wary if anyone offers to sell you an enormous gold mine on borneo . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
