{"text": "baghdad , iraq the head of iraq 's main humanitarian group said an 18-year-old approached him with a baby suffering from leukemia . the desperate mother said she 'd do  anything  for treatment for her child -- and then offered herself up for sex . baha , 12 , waits for treatment in an iraqi red crescent center after shrapnel pierced his left eye . said ismail hakki breaks down in tears as he recalls that story . leukemia can be treatable to a degree in much of the world , but not in iraq . the baby died two months later .  it shook me like hell ,  said hakki , the president of the iraqi red crescent .  all my life i 've been a surgeon . i 've seen blood ; i 've seen death . that never shook me -- none whatsoever . but when i see the suffering of those people , that really shook me .  the plight of iraq 's children is nearing epidemic proportions , he said , with mothers and fathers abandoning their children  because they 're becoming a liability .  the parents do n't do it out of convenience , they do it out of desperation . watch the plight of iraq 's children   when you become so desperate , you tend to just throw everything up and go ,  hakki said .  every time i look at those children , i ask myself first , ` what crime have those children committed ? '  hakki says red crescent has the monumental task of treating and feeding more than 1.6 million children under the age of 12 who have become homeless in their own country . that 's roughly 70 percent of the estimated 2.3 million iraqis who are homeless inside iraq . how to help the iraqi red crescent . with 95,000 volunteers and 5,000 employees , the iraqi red crescent is the last line of defense for the country 's poor , sick and displaced . they try to blend in as best they can , with shiites , sunnis and kurds working in the neighborhoods distinct to their ethnicities . six employees of the iraqi red crescent have been killed over the last four years . eight have been wounded , including six left disabled by the severity of their wounds . hakki says the spike in numbers of abandoned children is especially alarming , the result of sectarian violence and drastic socio-economic problems . the majority of parents in iraq , he says , leave their children with a single relative who often has about 20 to 30 children to look after . some parents just leave their kids altogether . many of the families are living in areas without basic needs , like water and electricity , and there are no jobs available .  it 's a desperate situation ,  he said .  children are becoming a liability for both the father and the mother .  the greatest concern is the ripple effect it will have in the long term -- an entire generation lacking basic life skills , surviving with no education , no income and no families . see wounded iraqi children get help in neighboring jordan   the trauma of what 's happening to those children is enormous ,  he said .  if somebody is injured by a bullet or shrapnel , it takes a week or two and he 's fine . ... the psycho-social injury is pretty deep and can take months , if not years , to heal .  that 's the task -- the mammoth task -- the iraq red crescent is facing .  the group gets some financial support from the central government . it 's also negotiating with the u.s. embassy , he said , to see if it can offer financial aid . but funds are low . just recently , the group closed 18 camps for the winter and is trying to house those thousands of people in abandoned government buildings . at a waiting room at an iraqi red crescent treatment center in baghdad 's mansour district , cnn came across several young children in desperate need of care . but they were among the lucky ones -- if that term can even be applied -- because their parents remain with them . baha , a 12-year-old boy , was waiting to see a doctor , recalling the exact date -- january 16 , 2004 -- he lost his left eye .  i want my eye to get well ,  he said . baha was with his father in a market when someone opened fire on u.s. soldiers . when the soldiers fired back , shrapnel hit his eye . despite what happened , this brave boy still goes to that same market .  i 'm not afraid ,  he said . across the room , 3-year-old saja lightened the mood in the room .  iraqis , we are still brothers !  she sang . she giggled , laughed and darted around , bringing smiles to all who saw her . yet , she could n't see most of what was around her . she 's blind in one eye and losing sight in the other -- the result of shoddy medical care . her father , dia'a , said he heard about the iraqi red crescent from television and others who had been treated here . he said he ca n't afford to travel outside the country for medical treatment for his girl . this clinic , he said , has given him  a ray of hope that i had lost .  he , too , expressed despair over the plight of iraq 's youngest generation .  our children are suffering . all they talk about is weapons and bombs ,  he said .  they are children . we are older ; our hair turns gray . what happens to them hearing all the explosions and bombs ?  we ca n't make them feel better because we are down .  that 's a sentiment that haunts the head of the iraqi red crescent .  there are times i get up in the middle of the night and i say , ` oh my god , how are we going to solve it ? god help me to help those kids !
