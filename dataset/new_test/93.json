{"text": "denver , colorado -- a colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter 's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $ 10,000 on a security system , hired a bodyguard for his son 's wedding and never leaves home without a .45 - caliber handgun strapped to his chest . keith reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case . the man , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case , says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of keith reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family . a report in the denver post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of colorado . paul logli , chairman of national district attorneys association , told congress this year that witness intimidation has become  almost epidemic ,  according to the denver post . when asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of colorado 's witness protection program , the witness in the reynolds case said ,  all they told us was maybe we should move .   i 'm pretty sure i told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program . i ca n't remember if i gave them all the details .  the prosecutor assigned to the case , who did n't want to be named , told cnn . after reynolds ' conviction , the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home . they received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked . the couple received a death threat from reynolds himself through the mail . watch witness describe fear of being targeted  reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation . however , it is likely he 'll be released within five years . no national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist , and minimal research has been conducted on the subject . the latest national institute of justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem . colorado has $ 50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget . in contrast , the city of denver spent almost $ 100,000 on landscaping last year . the state , on average , spends about $ 1,000 per witness . that figure supposedly includes moving expenses , rent , and furniture . the federal program spends in excess of $ 40 million per year on witness protection . one possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities , as do federal witnesses .  it 's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public 's expense ; it 's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses ,  according to peter weir , executive director of the colorado department of public safety . colorado 's witness protection program is a  joke ,  according to the rev. leon kelly , founder and executive director of the open door youth gang alternatives . kelly says the state does n't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward . more than a decade ago , a young man named darryl givens asked kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison . givens chose to testify . a few months later , he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends . that day continues to haunt kelly . rhonda fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son 's murder . javad fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married . he had plans to move east when a fourth of july barbecue in 2004 in changed all that . he witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing . javad fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in aurora , colorado . the couple , both 22 , died instantly . rhonda fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program . she confronted prosecutors after his murder . fields told cnn ,  i asked them what happened . why were n't any measures taken to safeguard his life ? and i was told he never asked for any protection .  javad 's mother does not think it was her son 's responsibility to ask for protection .  i think it 's the authorities ' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness ,  she said . field 's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program . prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting javad fields ' personal information be kept secret , but it was n't signed by a judge until one year later , after defense lawyers had already given the suspects fields ' personal information , along with crucial trial documents .  i felt like the da 's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life ,  rhonda fields told cnn . district attorney carol chambers maintains the program has improved . she says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena , ensuring witnesses are aware of their options . that did n't start , however , until two years after javad fields was killed . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
