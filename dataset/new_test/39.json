{"text": "explorer dennis schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near greenland . fishermen pass by greenland 's ilulissat fjord in this september 2004 picture . such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity , even wonder perhaps , but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer . the island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier . but such a large amount of ice melted , it revealed the distinct island .  i very quickly realized two things ,  he told cnn 's anderson cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year .  one -lsb- was -rsb- that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change .   the other thing was that it meant it was really happening . it was n't a joke . it was n't just statistics . it was really happening .  he calls his discovery warming island . many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the earth 's climate are the result of an increase in the world 's temperature , a trend widely called global warming . many global warming experts say the phenomenon , if unchecked , is capable of altering the world 's climate and geography . in the worst-case scenario , experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels , flooding cities and altering seashores . other scientists and observers , a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous , say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet 's life . most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere . but why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious . the earth 's temperature averages about 60 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- about 16 degrees celsius -rrb- . the average surface temperature has warmed one degree fahrenheit -lrb- 0.6 degrees celsius -rrb- during the last century , according to the national research council . the temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910 , according to the u.s. environmental protection agency . they rose till about 1945 , cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day . there are several possible reasons for the warming , scientists say . a change in the earth 's orbit or the intensity of the sun 's radiation could change , triggering warming or cooling . the reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases , which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet 's temperature at a comfortable level . the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , for instance , has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age , according to the united nations ' intergovernmental panel on climate change , commonly referred to as the ipcc . the presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels , but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades , according to the epa . meanwhile , nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years . many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities , like the burning of fossil fuels , emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests .  for the last 30 years , there 's no way there 's anything natural that can explain it ,  stephen schneider , a professor of environmental studies at stanford university in california , said .  a vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming ,  he added . many scientific organizations share schneider 's view , ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the g8 to the national research council , the american meteorological society and the american geophysical union . but there are those who do not share his view , and among the skeptics is richard lindzen , a professor of atmospheric sciences at the massachusetts institute of technology .  we 've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves ,  he said .  when we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970 , we were proclaiming global cooling . since then , there 's been a few tenths of global warming , so we 're proclaiming global warming .  he believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability , where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal .  the earth is always getting colder and warmer ,  he said .  it 's always changing . in fact , this is true of any fluid-covered planet .  asked about glacial melt , which many observers point to as evidence of global warming , lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained .  we do n't know why , but it 's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they 've occurred ,  he said .  what we 're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that 's occurring due to global warming .  yet , for schneider , it is a cause for concern and alarm .  we 're already in serious melt , nobody can explain it . the models do n't predict it ,  he said .  we do n't know what 's going on up there . all we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty .  the greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world 's nations . the ipcc in february 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels , temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 2 to 4.5 degrees celsius -rrb- by 2100 . the lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes , droughts , wildfires and flooding , schneider said . the higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of hollywood filmmakers . uncertainties , however , plague such forecasts , which are based on computer simulations and models . the models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere , oceans and continents interact , all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them .  exactly how much it 's going to warm up , we do n't know ,  schneider said .  that it 's going to warm up ? i 'd bet anything on that .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
