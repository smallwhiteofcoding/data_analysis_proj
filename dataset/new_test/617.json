{"text": "u.s. health officials said wednesday they have found a contaminant in a blood-thinning drug produced by baxter healthcare corp. that has been linked to more than a dozen deaths in the united states . the drug can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins , arteries , and lungs . in early february , the food and drug administration launched an investigation and then a recall of some forms of the product . the scrutiny began after a spike in reports of health problems associated with heparin , a drug made by baxter from pig intestines at plants in china and wisconsin . though the cause of the problems has not been determined , fda investigators found  a heparin-like compound -- that is not heparin -- present in some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients  in both facilities , said dr. janet woodcock , acting director of the fda 's center for drug evaluation and research . the contaminant , which made up 5 percent to 20 percent of each sample tested ,  reacts like heparin in some of the conventional tests used for heparin ,  which explains why it was not picked up , she told reporters in a conference call . no causal link between the contaminant and the adverse events has been established yet , woodcock said . she added that it was not clear whether the contaminant was added accidentally , as part of the processing or deliberately . it also was not clear whether the contaminant was introduced in the company 's plant in wisconsin or the one in china , woodcock said . though she said the exact structure of the contaminant has not been identified ,  it is similar to heparin glycans .  glycans are polysaccharides , a complex class of carbohydrate . she added it was unclear whether other heparin products used outside the united states might also contain the product . later this week , the agency will release recommendations on how manufacturers and regulators can screen for the contaminant , she said . last year , pet food made in china was found to be tainted with an ingredient that replaced more expensive protein and that initial tests did not identify as a contaminant . asked if the heparin contamination could be a similar case , woodcock said ,  it 's possible .  doctors have used the blood-thinner for 60 years with  no history of any problems whatsoever ,  said the fda commissioner , dr. andrew c. von eschenbach . its intravenous use can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins , arteries and lungs . von eschenbach said it would be  disingenuous  to expect the agency would be able to inspect  every institution in every case .  over the last fiscal year , the agency reported having inspected more than 1,000 foreign plants , a record . since the agency issued its report that 19 deaths had been linked to the drug since january 1 , 2007 , it has received word of another 27 deaths ,  but many of those do not fit our definition of this type of event ,  woodcock said . in all , the fda has received 785 heparin-linked reports of adverse events -- including difficulty breathing , nausea , vomiting , excessive sweating and plummeting blood pressure that can lead to life-threatening shock .  they 're continuing to come in fairly rapidly because there has been a lot of reporting of this ,  she said . in a written statement , baxter said its tests have suggested  that the root cause may be associated with the crude heparin , sourced from china , or from the subsequent processing of that product before it reaches baxter .  meanwhile , scientific protein laboratories llc , which supplies the company with the active pharmaceutical ingredients , issued a statement saying it is working with the fda , baxter and outside experts to identify the cause of the adverse events .  thus far , no conclusions have been reached about the root cause ,  it said .  it is premature to conclude that the heparin active pharmaceutical ingredient sourced from china and provided by spl to baxter is responsible for these adverse events .  it said that its voluntary recall of suspect product was being made as a precaution . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
