{"text": "cern , switzerland scientists wednesday applauded as one of the most ambitious experiments ever conceived got successfully underway , with protons being fired around a 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- tunnel deep beneath the border of france and switzerland in an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe . scientists applaud during the switch on operation of the large hadron collider . the large hadron collider -- a $ 9 billion particle accelerator designed to simulate conditions of the big bang that created the physical universe -- was switched on at 0732 gmt to cheers and applause from experts gathered to witness the event . while observers were left nonplussed by the anticlimactic flashing dots on a tv screen that signalled the machine 's successful test run , among teams of scientists involved around the world there were jubilant celebrations and popping champagne corks . in the coming months , the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions . skeptics , who claim that the experiment could lead to the creation of a black hole capable of swallowing the planet , failed in a legal bid to halt the project at cern , the european organization for nuclear research . others have branded it a colossal waste of cash , draining resources from its multinational collaborators that could have been spent on scientific research with more tangible benefits to mankind . sound off : what do you think of the experiment ? french president nicolas sarkozy hailed the project as a major achievement for europe .  the repercussions of this scientific investment without precedent in the history of humanity will be essential not only for the intimate knowledge of our universe , but also for the direct applications in fields as varied as intensive calculation or even medicine ,  he said . watch as big bang experiment gets underway  the collider will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year , potentially generating enough data to make a discovery by 2009 , experts say . they say the experiment has the potential to confirm theories that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions . they also hope to find a theoretical particle called the higgs boson -- sometimes referred to as the  god particle ,  which has never been detected , but would help explain why matter has mass . the collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the big bang , when there was a hot  soup  of tiny particles called quarks and gluons , to look at how the universe evolved , said john harris , u.s. coordinator for alice , a huge detector specialized to analyze that question . since this is exploratory science , the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories , but which are just as interesting , said joseph lykken , theoretical physicist at the fermi national accelerator laboratory .  when columbus sails west , he thought he was going to find something . he did n't find what he thought he was going to find , but he did find something interesting ,  said lykken , who works on the compact muon solenoid , one of six experiments inside the collider complex . why should the layperson care about this particular exploration ? years ago , when electrons were first identified , no one knew what they were good for , but they have since transformed our entire economy , said howard gordon , deputy research program manager for the collider 's atlas experiment .  the transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better ,  said gordon , at brookhaven national laboratory .  it 's important for just who we are , what we are .  fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole earth . such fears prompted legal actions in the u.s. and europe to halt the operation of the large hadron collider , alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge . although physicists acknowledge that the collider could , in theory , create small black holes , they say they do not pose any risk . a study released friday by cern scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny , and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving . five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told cnn there would be no danger from potential black holes . john huth , who works on the collider 's atlas experiment , called such fears  baloney  in a recent interview , and noted that in normal physics , even if the black hole were stable , it could just pass through the earth without being detected or without interacting at all .  the gravitational force is so weak that you 'd have to wait many , many , many , many , many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could -lsb- get -rsb- big enough to even get close to being a problem ,  said huth , professor of physics at harvard university . cnn 's elizabeth landau contributed to this story .", "summary": "no summary"}
