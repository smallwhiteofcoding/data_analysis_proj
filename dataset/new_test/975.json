{"text": "london , england human rights and freedom of the press in china , the detention of terrorist suspects by the united states and russia 's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in amnesty international 's annual report , released wednesday , which looks at the state of human rights around the world . amnesty international protestors outside the us supreme court in january dressed as guantanamo bay detainees . the 398-page report comes 60 years after the united nations adopted the universal declaration of human rights , and amnesty says governments still need to act on their promises .  the biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership ,  the organization said in a statement . irene khan , amnesty 's secretary-general , said that in particular ,  the human-rights flash points in darfur , zimbabwe , gaza , iraq and myanmar demand immediate attention .  the report , the group said ,  reveals a world riven by inequality , scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression .  according to its count , people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries , face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries . of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report , amnesty paid particular attention to china , the host of this summer 's olympic games . the group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in china in 2007 , with ethnic and religious minorities -- including tibetans , falun gong practitioners and christians -- repressed or persecuted . death penalty statistics in china are difficult to assess , amnesty said , but based on public reports , the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007 . amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in china and said censorship of the internet and other media intensified last year .  the chinese authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information ,  the report said .  they decided what topics and news stories could be published , and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives . the authorities continued to block web sites and to filter internet content based on specified words and topics .  around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online , amnesty said . amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the united states , where 42 people were executed last year . it noted new jersey 's decision in december to abolish the death penalty made it the first u.s. state in more than 40 years to do away with executions . as it has in previous annual reports , amnesty criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba .  the usa must close guantanamo detention camp and secret detention centers , prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them , and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment ,  amnesty said . the group noted that guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely , most of them without charge and without recourse to u.s. courts . most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum-security facilities , heightening concerns for their physical and mental health , amnesty said . in fact , more is written on the united states than any other country listed in the report . asked about that at a press conference tuesday , khan said ,  we certainly devote a lot of time to sudan , to china , to zimbabwe and other countries . but we look to the u.s. to provide leadership around the world . governments around the world look to the united states as a role model for their own behavior .  in a lengthy section on iraq , amnesty noted that thousands of civilians , including children , were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007 .  all sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations , some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity ,  the report said . abductions , torture and murder , with bodies left in the street , occur daily , and the violence has caused 2 million iraqis to flee to syria , jordan and elsewhere , amnesty said . u.s. forces held some 25,000 detainees  without charge or trial ,  the group said , and 33 people were executed ,  some after grossly unfair trials .  in afghanistan , conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to  large-scale displacement  of people throughout the year .  at least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict ,  the report said .  violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups .  russia must show greater tolerance for political dissent , amnesty said .  the russian authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism , branding it ` unpatriotic , '  the report said .  a crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run-up to the state duma -lsb- parliament -rsb- elections in december .  the european court of human rights ruled that russia was responsible for enforced disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in chechnya , amnesty said . there were fewer reported disappearances in the chechen republic in 2007 than in previous years , amnesty said , but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses . the report also criticized human rights conditions in iran , gaza and myanmar . human rights conditions in zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007 , the report said ,  with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association , assembly and expression .  members of the main opposition party , the mdc , along with other human rights defenders , were arrested , and many were tortured while in custody , amnesty said . some 4 million people required food aid because of the nation 's deteriorating economy , and victims of forced evictions in 2005 continued to live in  deplorable conditions  while president robert mugabe 's government failed to remedy their situation .  human rights problems are not isolated tragedies , but are like viruses that can infect and spread rapidly , endangering all of us ,  khan said .  governments today must show the same degree of vision , courage and commitment that led the united nations to adopt the universal declaration of human rights 60 years ago .
