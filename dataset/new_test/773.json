{"text": "a mining company has found what may be the largest gold deposit ever found in the british isles , the company 's chairman said tuesday . the price of gold is at historic highs , making new prospects very valuable . drill samples indicate more than 1 million ounces of gold may lie below what is now rolling irish countryside , said richard conroy , the chairman of dublin , ireland-based conroy diamonds and gold . with the price of gold near historic highs , the find could be worth as much as $ 300 million on the market , conroy told cnn . the company has been working for 10 years to find gold in a 1,500-square kilometer -lrb- 600-square-mile -rrb- area spanning the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland , he said . the site where the company found the gold is near clontibret , a village in the northern part of ireland , he said .  i think it 's a major development in ireland that we now have a significant gold resource ,  conroy said .  it 's the largest amount of gold , the largest number of ounces , that 's ever been reported in ireland , or indeed in either britain or ireland .  the price of gold is currently around $ 900 an ounce on global commodities markets . factoring in costs for mine construction and operation , conroy said , the gold near clontibret could fetch roughly $ 300 million . the company now plans to do more drilling at the site and conduct feasibility studies before moving ahead , he said . an analyst cautioned , however , that the reported amount of gold is still only an estimate .  until you 've actually mined the stuff , there 's always a moderate level of uncertainty ,  said william tankard , a senior analyst at metals consultancy gfms in london . one million ounces , if confirmed , would be significant for both conroy and ireland , tankard said . ireland has small precious metal deposits but nothing as large as conroy 's reported find , tankard said . conroy said only one gold mine is currently active in ireland .  by no means is it world-leading , but a million ounces is certainly worth thinking about ,  tankard said . tankard added that the quality of the gold -- including grade and how concentrated it is -- will also affect its value .", "summary": "no summary"}
