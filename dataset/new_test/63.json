{"text": "washington attacks are down 75 percent in recent months in a perilous stretch of neighborhoods in northeastern baghdad , prompting a u.s. military officer to proclaim monday that security there is  dramatically improving .  concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of baghdad , a military official says . people line the streets , cars congest them , trash collectors and other city workers have returned , local leaders are holding community meetings again and  markets have come back like gangbusters ,  said army col. don farris , commander of 2nd brigade combat team , 82nd airborne division . he added that the largely sunni al qaeda in iraq presence has been  crushed  since the beginning of may . however , there are still dangers , most notably the threats posed by iranian-backed shiite militants , farris said . speaking to pentagon reporters via video link from baghdad , farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation . among them is the  surge ,  the additional u.s. troops deployed earlier this year . watch how old rivalries have been posing problems  also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr 's mehdi army and the development of a program that employs  concerned local citizens  to assist u.s. and iraqi forces , farris said . some of those citizens are members of local sunni  awakening councils ,  comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area . especially in the last six weeks , farris said , civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests , two iranian operatives among them .  from my foxhole , in our sector , it is working ,  he said of the improving security in the area .  i can only speak to what i see in my sector and i am encouraged .  farris ' sector -- which includes the sunni-dominated district of adhamiya and sadr city , the shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a  remarkable turnaround ,  he said . many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads . despite improvements in the security situation , farris warned that  we still have a lot of work to do  because there does n't appear to be any sign that shiite extremists with links to iran are halting their activities . farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators , which are often delivered or manufactured by iran . nine such bombs were found in late october , he said . there are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into sadr city , he said . there are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area , farris said , because  essential services  like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff . though a  trickle  of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return , farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape . paul folmsbee , a state department provincial reconstruction team leader , said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law , governance , economic development and essential services . farris ' monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by u.s. and iraqi military officials over recent weeks . the military officials say they are seeing signs of sunni-shiite reconciliation . at a press conference earlier monday in baghdad , brig. gen. ed cardon , deputy commander for support of multi-national division-center , discussed a  definite period of progress  in his region on the southern baghdad outskirts . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
