{"text": "celebrity chef bobby chinn has tried his hand at a number of things . chinn 's face for television : picking up his asian tv award in 2007 . english boarding school taught him that food could be an awful experience ; wall street taught him that creativity was more important than money and a stint as a stand-up comedian taught him that you ca n't always get it right . half chinese , half egyptian , chinn 's grandmothers were his first introduction to the variety and pleasure that food can bring . while his palate was subdued by the meals he was given at school in england when he was a boy , his meandering route to becoming a chef came some time after attaining a degree in finance and economics . moving to new york after graduating he worked on wall street .  you did n't produce anything at the end of a day and you did n't breathe fresh air , you did n't know what the weather was like outside because you were on the floor of the new york stock exchange . it 's like the dungeon of capitalism where time and money met ,  he told cnn 's talk asia . chinn escaped  the dungeon  after a year and a half to the sunny climes of california , but it was n't to laze around . an addiction to high-octane and challenging environments saw chinn explore the possibility of being a stand-up comic .  i was always afraid to talk in front of the class and now i am trying to make them laugh  he told cnn .  one day you are really funny and then you go to another gig the same night and nobody laughs and then at the same time you are living a life of poverty . when you are bombing as a comic i do n't think there can be a worse life .  while finding out the hard way how funny , or not , he was , chinn was working front-of-house in restaurants , nurturing his love of food . his break came when hubert keller from san francisco restaurant fleur de lys took him on as a volunteer in his kitchen .  he gave me a job and after one week he said ` ok , you can stay . ' and then when you work with one really great chef , then i think you can work anywhere ,  he said . after also training with chefs in france , chinn made his own mark on the culinary world when he opened his first restaurant in vietnam in 1995 , and at first found the going tough .  supplies were not consistent , the language barrier , the taste barrier , the hygiene barriers . those are very taxing on a person like me with very little patience .  a high-energy chef and now a tv celebrity who presents  world caf√© asia  -- he won an asian television award in 2007 -- chinn is aware that being flavor of the month on tv is transitory .  it is just a machine that feeds on people like me and then spits me out when my time is done . you just have to go with the flow .
