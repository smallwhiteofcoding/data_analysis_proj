{"text": "ecological and conservation groups are praising a move by the environmental protection agency to impose new restrictions on rat poisons to help reduce the threat of accidental exposure to children and wildlife . the rules say only farmers , livestock owners and certified rodent control employees can buy rat poison in bulk .  we are very happy that the epa has done all it can to get these products off of the consumer market ,  said michael fry , director of conservation advocacy for the american bird conservancy .  by putting these restrictions in place , they are allowing a compromise to be made between themselves and organizations who have been working on this problem for a long time .  the epa 's new measures , which were handed down thursday , require that rat poisons be kept in bait stations above ground and in containers that meet agency standards . loose bait , such as pellets , and the four most hazardous types of pesticides , known as  second-generation anticoagulants ,  will no longer be sold for personal use . under the new restrictions , only farmers , livestock owners and certified rodent control employees will be allowed to purchase rat poison in bulk . bags larger than 8 pounds will no longer be sold at hardware and home-improvement stores . children who come into contact with highly toxic pellets can experience terrible symptoms from digesting them . they include internal bleeding , nosebleeds , hair loss and extensive bruising . between 2001 and 2003 , rat poison was responsible for nearly 60,000 poisonings , according to a study done by the american association of poison control centers . about 250 of these yearly exposures result in serious injuries or death . the epa said it believes the restrictions will not only keep the products out of children 's hands , but also reduce the ecological and wildlife risks associated with exposure to rat poison . bait blocks that are typically placed on the ground use fish and other flavors that attract endangered species , including mountain lions .  in california , almost every animal tested by the national wildlife service had residues of rodenticides ,  said fry .  the rat baits are also very lethal to scavengers , because the toxins remain in the rodent 's body long after they initially die .  although the epa is receiving considerable praise for the initiative , this is n't the first time the agency has worked to combat the threat of rat poison . in 1998 , the epa established two standards for rat poison . the agency required manufacturers to include an ingredient that made the poison taste bitter and use an indicator dye that would make the ingestion of pesticides more recognizable . but regulations were revoked in 2001 after the agency came to a mutual agreement with manufacturers to rescind the requirements .  we determined that the dye was n't effective in keeping children from being accidentally exposed and the bittering agent actually resulted in a loss of efficiency in controlling rodents ,  said steven bradbury , director of the agency 's division of special review and re-registration .  in our decision thursday , we felt that we needed an approach that would stop children coming in contact with the pesticides in the first place . that ultimately led to the implementation of bait stations ,  bradbury said . the decision to revoke the requirements led the west harlem environmental action , inc. and the natural resource defense council to file a lawsuit three years later . both organizations saw the retraction as a way to make it easy for consumers to purchase unsafe rodenticides over the counter . according to the west harlem group , inner-city housing and park departments such as the new york city housing authority could continue laying rat baits in public areas that were easily accessible to children .  studies show that the number of poisonings in minority children is much higher than others ,  said aaron colangelo , a staff attorney at the natural resource defense council .  not only do we have an environmental health issue , but an environmental justice issue as well .  new york state health department studies showed that 57 percent of children hospitalized for rat poisoning were black and 26 percent were latino . the epa said it is working to reduce those numbers in upcoming years with regulations like the ones it introduced this week .  we were frustrated that the epa dragged their feet for three years before finally taking some productive steps ,  said colangelo .  but , from our perspective , they are finally starting to do what needs to be done in order to protect children .  after june 4 , rat poison manufacturers will have 90 days to comply with the epa 's guidelines . they will then have the opportunity to design new bait stations and formulas for their poisons . all new products should be registered and certified by june 2011 .", "summary": "no summary"}
