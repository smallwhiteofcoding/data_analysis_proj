{"text": "new delhi , india three weeks after an apparent misunderstanding sparked a confrontation , deadly hindu-christian riots continue unabated in the remote east indian state of orissa . police officers chase away a protester in mangalore , india , monday . by tuesday , about 20 deaths had been reported , said praveen kumar , the superintendent of police in the worst-affected kandhamal district . the latest casualty is a police officer who died after an armed mob of about 400 to 500 mostly hindus torched a police station in the district on monday , orissa state police said . orissa 's director general of police g.c. nanda the policeman died when the mob opened fire at officers fleeing the burning building . the attack , he said , may have been in retaliation for arrests that police made in the ongoing communal fighting . watch more about the riots in india  the attack came two days after police fired on a crowd to prevent it from attacking christian residents . between three and six people died in the shooting , cnn 's sister network cnn-ibn reported . the violence spread to southern india over the weekend when vandals attacked 14 churches in an hour in the state of karnataka sunday , the network said . the christian community in the karnataka -- numbering about 2.5 million -- said right-wing hindus are targeting them for opposing the violence in orissa . by tuesday , police had arrested about 140 people in connection with the riots , said karnataka 's inspector general of police a.m. prasad . sixty of them -- all hindus -- were arrested for the church attacks , prasad said . the rest , mostly christians , were charged with disturbing the peace , he said . orissa has historically been a tinderbox of hindu-christian tensions . some hindu groups view the work of christian missionaries in the state with suspicion . they accuse missionaries of bribing or forcing hindus into converting . the seeds for the current conflict were planted on august 23 , when hindu leader , laxmananda saraswati , and four others were killed in kandhamal after 20 to 30 gunmen barged into a hindu school and began shooting , the orissa chief minister 's office said . the authorities have not determined who killed saraswati , but after the incident they detained five people who are christians , said sukanta panda , spokesman for the chief minister . the government says the killings may have been the work of maoist rebels -- investigators have many unanswered questions -- but some hardline hindus blamed a christian minority . they took to the streets in anger , rampaging through predominantly christian neighborhoods , ransacking shops and torching houses . they chopped down trees to block roads , making it difficult for police to reach trouble spots . a christian orphanage was set on fire . a 20-year-old woman , who was teaching children inside , burned to death . christian residents fought back , and the clashes spread . authorities imposed a night curfew in many towns and deployed state and federal forces in the troubled areas , kumar -- the police superintendent -- said . both sides said the violence has left christian churches and hindu temples razed to the ground . this is not the first time the simmering anger has boiled over in the state with deadly consequences . in 1999 , a hindu mob burned to death an australian missionary , graham staines , and his two children while they slept inside their car . and last christmas , clashing groups killed four people and burned several churches in the same orissa district -- kandhamal . maoist rebels , who claim to be fighting for the poor and the dispossessed , have been battling the indian government in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties since the late 1960s . some christians accept the maoist theory , saying the rebels have also struck against hard-line hindus because they associate them as being closely aligned with the government . but hindu groups insists that christians were behind saraswati 's death . unlike orissa , karnataka has until now been spared the large-scale clash between christians and hindus . but now , many in the christian community fear their calm and prosperous state may become another battleground between the two religions , cnn-ibn said . cnn 's harmeet singh contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
