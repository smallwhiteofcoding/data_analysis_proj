{"text": "miami , florida sharon long 's work has earned her the nickname  skull lady .  sharon long is a forensic artist whose job is to help identify the dead , often murder victims . she is a forensic artist whose job is to give faces -- and sometimes identities -- back to anonymous murder victims who have been robbed of both . armed with sculptor 's clay , glass eyes , wigs and research , long creates a face from a human skull . when fort myers , florida , police found eight sets of human remains in the woods in march , they turned to her -- anything to help identify the people who were so mercilessly left to rot amid the trees and mud .  -lsb- police -rsb- have no other way . they have no fingerprints ; they have no flesh . usually , the last resort is building a face ,  long said . see the  skull lady  at work  she hopes that when the faces of those killed get printed in newspapers or appear on tv or online , a friend or loved one recognizes them and says ,  gee , we have n't seen so-and-so for a while , and that kind of looks like him .   then , at least , you have a lead , and then you can get dna from people . and then -lsb- police -rsb- have something to go on .  long , 67 , has made faces for the unknown victims of grisly homicides and solved historical mysteries . during her 20-year career , the forensics specialist from the university of wyoming helped identify the crew of the h.l hunley , a confederate submarine sunk during the civil war . she also created the first picture of the only explorer to have died on the lewis and clark expedition . when law enforcement asks for long 's assistance , it is almost always on a case that has gone very cold . and that was exactly the case in fort myers , where police were desperate for any information on the dead they found : eight men killed , their bodies discovered in a wooded area on march 23 , 2007 . watch how bones can give clues to investigators  there were no witnesses , no leads and little evidence of killings other than the victims ' bones . if long could identify the victims of the crime , it might help to catch a serial killer . but before long could create any likeness of the victims , she would have to do a lot of work -- hundreds of hours of it . long first creates a mold of the skull and uses it to make a plaster replica . she puts eraser tips on points to mark tissue depth . sculptor 's clay fills in for skin and muscle . the faded gumline on the skull 's teeth helps long determine how thick the person 's lips were . the victim 's hair and eye color requires guesswork and research , long says . often while working on cases , she talks to people who lived in the same area as the victim or victims to find out the most common eye color and what hairstyles are in fashion . see how to decode a face  she spent two months on the fort myers skulls .  i start working , and 15 hours can go by , and i do n't get up and move , and you do n't realize how much time has gone by , and , well , that 's how intense i get ,  she said .  it 's like you get carried away in this life of somebody . i start trying to think of them as being an alive person and doing something and not getting killed .  eventually , publicity about the fort myers case would lead people with missing relatives to submit their dna . testing revealed that two of the men were erik kohler and john blevins . both men lived hardscrabble lives and had run-ins with police . both disappeared in 1995 . at a news conference last month where fort myers police unveiled long 's sculptures , investigators said they still need to identify the other six victims if they are to solve the case . kohler and blevins did n't closely mirror long 's sculptures of their faces , but there were some similarities , some facial features that looked liked the two dead men . and that 's what police say they want : they hope people with missing relatives will look at every detail of the other six sculptures to see whether they notice any resemblance , no matter how faint .  going into this , i knew there would be some level of subjectivity in the art part of it , but i think what it does is generate the interest ,  fort myers police detective barry lewis said .  i am just looking for that one little similarity , that one little key that someone could recognize that they could make a call that that is their loved one .  since the news conference , police say , they have received hundreds of leads . long 's work on the case might be done , but she still has nightmares about the eight men killed .  i hear screaming , and i hear pleading , and i hear all these things which i could n't imagine ,  she said .  i can see somebody dragging a body out there , and here he kept taking them to the same area . i think , what in the hell is wrong with this guy ?  six of those killed remain nameless . and police are still trying to find the killer . authorities urge anyone with more information on the case to call 877-667-1296 . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
