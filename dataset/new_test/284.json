{"text": "london , england the sole survivor of the crash that killed princess diana has told a court he still can not remember the incident but does not support the conspiracy theories surrounding it . bodyguard trevor rees and the back of princess diana 's head are seen shortly before the car crash . bodyguard trevor rees , formerly known as trevor rees-jones , was the front-seat passenger in the mercedes that carried diana , her boyfriend , dodi fayed , and their driver , henri paul . he sustained serious injuries in the august 31 , 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident , threatening him to keep quiet . he said the caller told him to keep quiet , saying ,  we know who you are , we know where you are , and we know where you live .  rees said he did n't take the calls or letters seriously . a lawyer also asked rees about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her ,  if i remember , they 're going to kill me .  rees said he did n't recall the conversation and found it unlikely he ever made the remark . rees , who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye , told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash , which , he has said , was an accident . he has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving the ritz hotel in paris , and that his next memory is more than a week later , in his hospital bed , when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead . rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw , the base of his brain , and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations , some of which al fayed paid for . rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , that british security services were behind the crash . he denied the security services paid him to change his story . at the time of the crash , rees was working for al fayed 's security team and was assigned to guard dodi fayed . he was also protecting the princess because she was fayed 's companion on the trip . he no longer works on al fayed 's security team . rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down , largely because he does into support al fayed 's conspiracy theories about the crash .  i am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all ,  rees testified .  all i have ever done is given the truth as i see it .  in 2000 , rees published a book ,  the bodyguard 's story : diana , the crash , and the sole survivor ,  offering his account of the events surrounding the crash . he said al fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book 's publication in england . rees told cnn he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew , but also to counter al fayed 's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident . rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills . during the morning session , rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash , but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories . in the first , rees said , he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently diana -- calling out ,  dodi  from the back seat of the car . in the second flashback , rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car . lawyer ian burnett then read from a letter written by al fayed to lord stevens , who investigated the crash for the british police . in the letter , al fayed says rees is lying about losing his memory .  he knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress ,  al fayed wrote , alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot . rees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss :  i have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel , that 's my last true memory .  rees also said claims the couple visited a jeweler 's in monte carlo to buy an engagement ring in late august 1997 were untrue . british authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances . a judge , who is also called a coroner , holds hearings to determine how the person died , but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt . although diana and dodi fayed died in paris , a british coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to britain . the inquest does not involve driver henri paul because his body remained in france . british authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after french authorities concluded their investigation , which lasted from august 1997 to late 2003 . the inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that british police could do their own report , which was needed for the british inquest . the british police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in december 2006 . the inquest then resumed in october 2007 and is expected to last four to six months . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's teresa
