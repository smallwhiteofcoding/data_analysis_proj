{"text": "editor 's note : two-time oscar winner denzel washington joined the mt. vernon boys & girls club in new york at the age of 6 and remained an active member for the next 12 years . the actor credits his early years spent at the club with changing the direction of his life . since 1994 , he has served as a volunteer national spokesman for boys & girls clubs of america , appearing in public service announcements on television and in print . he 's also a member of the group 's board . denzel washington says america 's leaders need to pay attention to the crisis affecting our children . with the political season in full swing , much is at stake for america . the economy is in a downward spiral . we have an energy crisis . our jobless rate is on the rise . these are the subjects that generate headlines and much debate among the candidates . but there is an underlying problem that we as a nation have not addressed , a situation that should concern any american with an eye on the future , regardless of party affiliation . it is the crisis affecting our children : . • nearly 30 percent of this year 's freshman class will drop out of high school , according to the national center for education statistics . that number jumps to 40 percent in some urban areas . • the obesity rate for our kids has gone up by as much as 300 percent since 1980 , according to the national center for health statistics , triggering a host of health-related problems , from diabetes to heart disease . • young people account for more than 20 percent of violent crimes in the united states , according to statistics cited by duke university 's center for child and family policy . violent juvenile crime peaks between 3 and 4 p.m. , at the end of the school day . these facts are grim enough . factor in persistent patterns of poverty , gang activity , drug abuse and teenage pregnancy , and you have a generation of americans that will be unprepared -- indeed , unable -- to meet the challenges posed by a complex world . we expect our leaders to lead . but as citizens , we should n't simply sit back and hope that politicians stand up to the test . we can participate in the political process , advocating for policies that will benefit the health , education and well-being of young americans , because we must do a better job of preparing our youth to lead . it is daunting to think about solving such a widespread crisis . but there are youth-serving organizations that can and do play a key role in effecting positive change -- places such as boys & girls clubs , with a long track record of helping young people turn things around , get an education , lead healthy lives and become effective leaders . i know , because i was one of those kids . club staff taught me right from wrong and made the lesson stick . they planted the seeds early on that led me to envision myself as a high school graduate , a college graduate and an achiever in whatever field i chose . boys & girls clubs do this today for millions of kids , offering everything from homework help to career exploration , performing a daily miracle that turns hope into opportunity . urging children and the adults in their lives to  be great ,  these clubs communicate the idea that there is potential for greatness in every child . this powerful call to action reminds us that we can all play a role in helping youth realize their dreams . so i ask you to join me in this effort . there are many ways to help : . • volunteering at a local youth organization . • leading by example . • donating to charities that make a difference . in partnership with government , schools , community leaders and parents , we can create a network and culture in which everyone embraces the importance of a positive future for our youth . but right now , with election day fast approaching , ask your local , state and national candidates what they are doing to help our young people become tomorrow 's leaders . ask them to make children a top priority and tell them that you hold them accountable . if we all become advocates for our children , elected officials might just take action . we can do better . and if we care about our nation 's future , we must do better . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .", "summary": "no summary"}
