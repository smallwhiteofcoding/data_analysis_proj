{"text": "gerolstein , germany -- mineral water company gerolsteiner have decided to drop their sponsorship of the german protour cycling team , which expires at the end of the 2008 season . german rider stefan schumacher is a member of the gerolsteiner team . gerolsteiner , who have been team sponsors since 1998 , said there was a change in marketing strategy . gerolsteiner has invested around $ 12 million annually in the team , which includes riders stefan schumacher , fabian wegmann , markus fothen and robert foerster . gerolsteiner said on tuesday they were no longer reaching their targeted audience through cycling because it was changing from being solely a producer of mineral water to a supplier of nonalcoholic drinks . gerolsteiner team chief hans-michael holczer was deeply upset by the news .  there were tears in my eyes ,  said holczer . the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- said they would help the team to find a new sponsor .  it is not an entirely unexpected decision . after such a long collaboration , you notice changes in your partner ,  said holczer , who will begin the hunt for a new sponsor .  we have one of the best teams on the market with a national and international reputation .  the t-mobile cycling team has fired rider lorenzo bernucci after his positive doping test at the tour of germany last month . bernucci violated the team 's code of conduct and was removed from t-mobile 's roster at the spanish vuelta , the team said on tuesday . he tested positive for a non-amphetamine appetite suppressant . bernucci is licensed by the monaco cycling federation , which will be responsible for further investigation and possible additional sanctions , t-mobile said . he tested positive on august 15 for the substance sibutramine , an appetite suppressant sold under various brand names , such as reductil and ectiva . the world governing body of cycling , uci , informed t-mobile of bernucci 's positive test . bernucci told team management that he had been using ectiva for four years and had purchased it over the counter at a pharmacy in italy , not knowing it been added to the list of prohibited substances by the world anti-doping agency , t-mobile said . according to uci rules , a first violation for sibutramine -- if it is determined that it was not intended as a performance enhancer -- can result in anything between a warning and a one-year suspension .  we do not know if this was an attempt at performance enhancement or just poor judgment ,  t-mobile team chief bob stapleton said .  but we know it is unacceptable that riders take any medication without the approval of the team doctor . it 's a clear violation of our code of conduct and we act now on that basis .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
