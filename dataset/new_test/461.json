{"text": "washington army gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. commander in iraq , has been chosen to become chief of u.s. central command , defense secretary robert gates said wednesday . gen. david petraeus has been the commander in iraq for more than a year . petraeus would replace adm. william fallon , who said last month that he was resigning . fallon said widespread , but false , reports that he was at odds with the bush administration over iran had made his job impossible . in addition , gates said , army lt. gen. ray odierno , commander of the multinational corps-iraq -- the no. 2 position in iraq -- is being nominated to fill petraeus ' post . odierno has been home from iraq for only a couple of months but has agreed to return , gates said . the plan is for petraeus to leave iraq in late summer or early fall , gates said , to ensure a smooth transition and plenty of time for odierno to prepare .  we expect to move the paperwork on these nominations to the white house and to the senate very quickly ,  gates said .  because of the complexity of this series of moves , i respectfully ask the senate to move on them expeditiously , hopefully by memorial day , so the families and we can plan appropriately .  odierno was in line for a pentagon desk job as army vice chief just over a year after helping petraeus implement the  surge  in u.s. troops in iraq . the pentagon says petraeus will stay in iraq long enough to make the first recommendation on further troop cuts after the surge is over . watch the challenges ahead of petraeus  gates said the generals ' promotions reflected an endorsement of the current course in iraq .  the course certainly that gen. petraeus has set has been a successful course . so , frankly , i think staying that course is not a bad idea . i would say it 's a good idea ,  gates said . watch gates nominate petraeus  central command , which oversees u.s. forces in east africa , the middle east and central asia , has its headquarters at macdill air force base in tampa , florida . gates said odierno is well known to troops in iraq , to military leadership and to iraqis , and  i believe , in most parts of the world , especially in the middle east , personal relationships make a difference .   i believe that this arrangement will probably preserve the likelihood of continued momentum and progress ,  gates said . the defense secretary said he expects to easily win senate approval for the nominations once they are made by president bush . he said he had spoken with sens. carl levin , d-michigan ; john mccain , r-arizona ; and john warner , r-virginia , and  i do n't really anticipate any problems .  in a press release wednesday , mccain praised the move .  both of these great generals have served our country with skill and distinction , and i am pleased that they will continue to do so in positions of high responsibility ,  mccain wrote . gates acknowledged that fallon 's  decision to step down was unexpected .   i had intended that adm. fallon probably stay on for a third year . his second year would have ended in february ,  he said .  so i 'm faced with a critical combatant command where a commander is needed -- and a commander who knows what 's going on in the region .  asked whether he was using petraeus  almost as a finger in the dike  because of the shortage of army generals with expertise in counterinsurgency warfare , gates admitted that there are few army officers with experience in and knowledge of iraq . odierno served as commander of the 4th infantry division , the unit that captured former iraqi president saddam hussein . petraeus was picked in january 2007 to replace gen. george casey as the chief commander in iraq and won senate confirmation that month . he previously served as head of the u.s. army combined arms center and as a commander in iraq , and he was one of the main writers of an army manual on counterinsurgency efforts . he was seen as the logical choice to replace fallon . in his new post , he will oversee u.s. forces in all the middle east , not only iraq and afghanistan .  i recommended him to the president because i am absolutely confident he is the best man for the job ,  gates said . in testimony to congress this month , petraeus said iranian agents have played a  destructive role  in iraq by backing shiite militants , called  special groups  by the united states . the u.s. believes that iran 's islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force is behind the support for militants .  unchecked , the special groups pose the greatest long-term threat to the viability of a democratic iraq ,  petraeus testified . last month , in an interview with cnn 's kyra phillips in baghdad , petraeus acknowledged some  friction  between himself and fallon in the past year , but  actually , over the last six months or so , our relationship was really very , very good .   there was friction in the beginning . he has a different job than i have ,  petraeus said .  there can be understandable differences of your take , if you will , on a situation . as they say in politics and government 101 , where you stand on an issue sometimes depends on where you sit in the organization , and we sit in different chairs .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's jamie mcintyre contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
