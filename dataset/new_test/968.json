{"text": "join roland martin for his weekly sound-off segment on cnn.com live at 11:10 a.m. wednesday . if you 're passionate about the topic , he wants to hear from you . roland martin says the three presidential candidates will never be  regular folks .  can we all just stop the silly nonsense over who is an elitist and whether an  average american  will occupy the white house ? listening to the punditry today , you would think folks who revel in the comedy of larry the cable guy or katt williams really would have a shot at the white house . it 's totally absurd . so , sen. barack obama is all of a sudden an elitist because he went to columbia and harvard ? and sen. hillary clinton is an elitist because she went to yale ? do you actually think sen. john mccain is n't an elitist ? he went to an exclusive college -- the naval academy , and that is one of the hardest places to get into . -lrb- you ca n't even apply unless a member of congress recommends you . -rrb- . karl rove , who tries to portray himself as the common man but is just another rich republican , has called both democratic candidates elitists . well , his former boss , president george w. bush , went to yale . so did bush 's dad , former president george h.w. bush , and his granddaddy , former sen. prescott bush . all three bushes also were members of the super elite organization skull and bones . the younger bush later went to harvard . he walked into the governor 's mansion and the presidency on the strength of his name and his dad 's money and connections . sounds like an elitist to me ! but no , we 're supposed to be fooled by the cowboy boots , folksy charm and him removing brush at his crawford , texas , ranch -lrb- do n't forget the family compound in kennebunkport , maine , where all the  regular  folks hang out -rrb- . surely you recall when bush nominated harriet miers for the supreme court ? those same conservative voices decrying the elitist democrats were blasting her because she went to little old southern methodist university , that unremarkable -- their view -- university in dallas , texas . -lrb- by the way , that will be the home of the george w. bush library . -rrb- . you can bet a pitcher of beer that had she graduated from harvard , yale or princeton , she would n't have been derisively referred to as too plain and not educated enough by the elitists in the republican party . and let 's stay with the supreme court for a moment . where did its members go to school ? chief justice john g. roberts jr. -- undergrad and law school , harvard . justice john paul stevens -- undergrad : university of chicago . law school : northwestern . justice antonin scalia -- undergrad : georgetown university and the university of fribourg , switzerland . law school : harvard . justice anthony kennedy -- undergrad : stanford university and the london school of economics . law school : harvard . justice david souter -- undergrad : harvard ; magdalen college , oxford ; oxford university . law school : harvard . justice clarence thomas -- undergrad : holy cross . law school : yale . justice ruth ginsburg -- undergrad : cornell . law school : harvard -lrb- attended -rrb- ; finished at columbia . justice stephen breyer -- undergrad , stanford ; magdalen college , oxford . law school : harvard . justice samuel alito -- undegrad : princeton . law school : yale . that 's pretty much an elite list of schools . we have deluded ourselves into thinking the person elected to the white house is really and truly like the rest of us . all three candidates do n't know what it 's like to face the daunting health care challenges millions of americans are confronted with daily . each are members of the u.s. senate , and they have the best health care money can buy for life -- we pay for it ! while your pension plan is shot to hell , their plan will never be underfunded . the members will see to that , courtesy of taxpayer dollars . forget how many times obama bowls gutter balls , clinton tosses back shots of whiskey and mccain talks about how he 's a regular guy . each , courtesy of their $ 169,300 annual salary , makes far more than the average american . and when it comes to wealth , clinton gets to enjoy the $ 100 million she and her husband raked in since he left the white house -lrb- even their hefty book advances dwarf regular authors -rrb- . mccain 's wife , cindy , runs one of anheuser busch 's largest beer distributors and is worth more than $ 100 million . they will never be living paycheck-to-paycheck . obama is the poorest of the three , but he did earn more than a million bucks courtesy of his best-selling books ,  the audacity of hope  and  dreams from my father  after delivering his 2004 keynote speech at the democratic national convention . how many average americans would n't mind having a million dollars in their savings account ? bottom line : the narrative about our presidential candidates being just regular folks is a tired myth that gets repeated each and every day . and their efforts to show that they are  just like us  are really pathetic . you do n't have to go duck hunting , be seen buying milk at the grocery store for your family or having a beer at the local bar to show that you 're  one of us .  just do what rich and highly educated folks do when they are in politics : advance policies that will at least allow me to keep a few more dollars in my pocket and be able to afford a home . one more thing : do n't buy fully into the nonsense tossed out by some of the loudest voices on television , radio and in print who decry these  elitists  and trumpet that they are for the blue collar , middle-class worker in middle america . many of them pull down multimillion-dollar salaries and run into these same candidates on martha 's vineyard and in the hamptons when they all vacation . they , too , will pull every favor they have to get their children in the posh private schools and ivy league institutions . yes , we even have elitists in the media . who would 've thunkit ? e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
