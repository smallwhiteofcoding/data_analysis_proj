{"text": "el calaboz , texas eloisa tamez said she is n't scared anymore , just determined .  i am not backing down ,  she said . the u.s. government wants to build a border fence like this one . about 100 landowners are fighting it . tamez owns three acres of land along the texas-mexico border where the department of homeland security would like to build a border fence . the property is a remnant of a 12,000-acre grant from spain to her family in 1767 , before the united states even existed .  it is my history . it is my heritage ,  tamez said . this week , the justice department began legal action against landowners and municipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land . tamez expects she will be sued sometime soon , but she is not intimidated . asked how long she will fight , she said ,  as long as i have to .  michael chertoff , the secretary of homeland security , said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like tamez .  can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual ?  chertoff told cnn .  i do n't think i can accept that .  watch chertoff say it 's  civic responsibility  to give up land  chertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs . he also argues it will increase the safety of border patrol agents who have faced increasing violence . the government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the mexican border , including 370 miles of it by the end of this year . about 70 miles of fence is to be built in the rio grande valley by year 's end , if the government gets its way . the rio grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border , but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across . on the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so . piles of underwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across . the swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags . then they disappear into the united states . the border patrol has stepped up its efforts in the rio grande valley with more lights , and sensors to pick up movement . a levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by border patrol vehicles to patrol the area . richard cortez , the mayor of the border town of mcallen , texas , believes hiring more border patrol agents , deepening the rio grande , and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence . cortez calls the fence  a multibillion-dollar speed bump ,  which will slow , but not stop , illegal immigration .  it is a false sense of security ,  he said .  america will not be safe . america will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work .  cortez and other border mayors who oppose construction of the fence formed a group called the texas border coalition . the coalition wrote to chertoff asking for further consultations on the fence , but this week the department of homeland security turned them down . while expressing support for open dialogue with residents and officials , david pagan of u.s. customs and border protection wrote in an e-mail ,  we do not plan to suspend work on the construction of fence in order to hold a series of additional consultation meetings .  cortez said his city is contemplating a court test of the law that mandated the construction of the border fence . and so a battle is being waged by about 100 landowners , those like eloisa tamez who are standing firm .  i will not allow them to come and survey my land . i have an american-given right to protect my property ,  she said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
