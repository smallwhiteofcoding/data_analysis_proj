{"text": "san francisco , california  human error factors  probably were involved in a ship crash and oil spill that killed nearly 400 birds in san francisco bay and prompted a federal criminal probe , the u.s. coast guard said monday . a worker checks oil cleanup gear near the golden gate bridge thursday in san francisco , california . the u.s. attorney in san francisco has opened a federal criminal investigation into wednesday 's crash of the mv cosco busan to determine whether the captain and crew violated federal maritime laws . although not officially detained , the captain and crew were barred by law from leaving the vessel , which is docked for repairs in oakland , the coast guard said .  you had a competently manned ship with a pilot , all the navigation and sensors ,  said adm. thad allen , coast guard commandant . there were  probably some human error factors , but we need to determine the facts , because there 's no reason a ship like that should have collided with the bridge .  watch allen on the criminal probe  the cosco busan was departing oakland for south korea when it struck a tower supporting the western suspension span of the bay bridge , cutting a 212-foot , 12-foot wide gash in the ship 's side . about 58,000 gallons of heavy-duty bunker oil poured out of the vessel as it was moored near treasure island . see where oil spilled  the oil sickened birds and formed globules on more than 20 of the area 's beaches . it oozed along the san francisco city waterfront and out of the bay , beneath the golden gate bridge toward marin county . allen defended the coast guard against criticism of its response to the spill . some lawmakers , including one of the state 's u.s. senators , democrat barbara boxer , have criticized the coast guard 's handling of the collision and resulting spill . boxer said the coast guard initially reported that the ship 's owner had said only 140 gallons had spilled from the cosco busan . boxer and house speaker nancy pelosi of california have called for congressional hearings into the accident and resulting spill . although allen conceded some confusion in the coast guard 's communication , he said it did not reflect their response .  response was set into play within an hour of the event itself ,  allen said monday . regarding the initial low estimate of 140 gallons of lost oil , allen said heavy fog and damage to the ship 's tanks hindered initial aerial and on-ground evaluations of how much oil had leaked from the ship . in addition to federal prosecutors , the national transportation safety board is investigating the accident , and ntsb spokeswoman debbie hersman said sunday that agency was interviewing the pilot , the ship 's crew , and other pilots who were on the water at the time of wednesday 's crash . see photos of oil coating the bay  the crew had been on its inaugural voyage on the ship , which the current owner purchased last month , hersman said . the ntsb also intends to review the ship 's voyage data recorder , which should have recorded captain and crew conversations on the bridge and other information in the 12 hours leading up to the bridge collision , hersman said . the oil spill has sparked concern among local officials and environmentalists . as of sunday , 23 beaches in the area remained closed . angel island state park , the bay 's largest island , reopened monday , the coast guard said . gov. arnold schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency , freeing money to clean up the spill . seven miles of containment boom stretched across the bay has collected more than 12,271 gallons of oil so far , and another 4,000 gallons have evaporated , officials said . nearly 400 dead birds have been recovered from the bay , while another 500 birds have been rescued alive but soaked in oil , according to lisa curtis , administrator of the department of fish and games office of spill prevention and response . in 1989 , the oil tanker exxon valdez ran aground and fouled alaska 's prince william sound with almost 11 million gallons of crude -- the nation 's worst ever oil spill . thousands of birds and animals died in the disaster , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . often birds and animals are threatened when they come in contact with the oil and swallow it as they try to clean themselves , said the noaa web site . in addition to birds , oil spills can be very harmful to fish and shellfish , noaa said . twenty wildlife teams were scheduled monday to be the bay , working to find sick birds so they can be rehabilitated , curtis said . on sunday , the state 's other u.s. senator and a leading coast guard official decried the accident .  this an incident which , in my view , should not have happened ,  sen. dianne feinstein , d-california , said sunday after being briefed by coast guard officials . rear adm. craig e. bone , the coast guard 's director of inspection and compliance , echoed feinstein 's comments .  this incident should have never ever occurred ,  he said .  there 's systems , there 's capabilities , there 's licensed operators , there 's a pilot on board the vessel , there 's the capacity and the capability to safely navigate through this port and waterways every day .  he added ,  but we have to move beyond the incident and the fact that it occurred and move forward into the response .  the california department of transportation said the collision did no structural damage to the bridge and there was no interruption of bridge traffic -- more than 250,000 vehicles daily . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
