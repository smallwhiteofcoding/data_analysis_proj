{"text": "one thing saudi people should not have to worry about is money . oil money is paying for saudi arabia 's growth but it is also the main cause of rising prices . the kingdom is awash in cash which keeps pouring into the world 's largest oil producer as prices rise . last year alone , saudi is estimated to have raked in about $ 200 billion from oil . it is this influx of money which is paying for saudi arabia 's economic growth -- but it is also the main cause of rising prices across the country .  there is no free lunch . if you want to grow at that base , you have to swallow a price every once in a while in the form of high inflation ,  said abdulrahman al harithi , ceo of investment bank , mena financial group . saudi people are certainly paying the price . inflation is currently running at 9.6 percent -- a 30-year high . at the beginning of the year , rental costs went up nearly 17 percent . in march , the cost of fuel and water increased almost 16 percent and other everyday staples also saw double digit gains . the kingdom 's business community is also concerned about the adverse effects of inflation . a recent survey of saudi arabia 's business confidence by financial services company , sabb , found that while confidence remains robust , over half of respondents were concerned that inflation would lead to rising business costs . prices in the kingdom will continue their upward trend , according to the analysts at sabb . what 's more , there is not much the saudi government can do to combat it . the riyal , like many other gulf currencies , is pegged to the u.s. dollar and while the gulf is booming , the u.s. is heading towards recession . as the economic fortunes of the two countries continue to diverge it is hard to see what can be done to combat inflation . the main problem is that whenever the u.s. federal reserve cuts interest rates , like it did this week , the kingdom must follow suit . in a booming economy like saudi 's , low interest rates push prices through the roof . the government is studying whether remedies like a minimum wage could ease the pain but some in the kingdom , like al harithi , say there is no quick solution .  honestly , i do n't ' think there is an answer for such a question . i do n't think there is a magical formula that could fix this issue ,  he told cnn . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
