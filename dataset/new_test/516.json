{"text": "we all want to live forever . but , chances are , you 'd rather forego a legacy altogether than have your name be synonymous with a goofy flub like a spoonerism or a dim-witted word like  dunce .  you can find a saint under tawdry in the dictionary . for the following eponyms , we ask : did these word-inspiring folks really deserve their drag through the linguistic mud ? 1 . dunce . dictionaries do n't play fair , and john duns scotus is proof . the 13th/14th-century thinker , whose writings synthesized christian theology and aristotle 's philosophy , was considerably less dumb than a brick . unfortunately for scotus , subsequent theologians took a dim view of all those who championed his viewpoint . these  scotists ,   dunsmen ,  or  dunses  were considered hairsplitting meatheads and , eventually , just  dunces .  2 . -lrb- slipping a -rrb- mickey . when you have to drug somebody against their will -lrb- hey , you got ta do what you got ta do -rrb- , it just would n't sound right to slip 'em a ricardo , a bjorn , or an evelyn . it 's got ta be a mickey . at the turn of the 20th century , mickey finn was a chicago saloon owner in one of the seediest parts of town -- and he fit right in . finn was known for serving  mickey finn specials ,  which probably included chloral hydrate , a heavy sedative . after targeted customers passed out , finn would haul them into his  operating room  and liberate them of all valuables -lrb- including shoes -rrb- . never a host of the year candidate , this mickey seems to have thoroughly earned his legacy , so do n't hesitate to use it the next time you drug and rob your own customers . 3 . spoonerism . reverend william archibald spooner -lrb- 1844 -- 1930 -rrb- was famous for his muddled one-liners . and though it 's hard to know which ones he actually said , lines such as  i have a half-warmed fish  and  yes indeed , the lord is a shoving leopard  still prove that the sound-switching flub is pretty charming as far as mistakes go . the spoonerism has even been used as a literary technique by poets and fiction writers , giving spooner little reason to roll over -- or otherwise inarticulately protest -- in his grave . 4 . lynch . although several lynches -lrb- not including david -rrb- have been investigated by inquisitive etymologists , virginia native charles lynch -lrb- 1736 -- 1796 -rrb- is most likely the man behind the murderous word . lynch was a patriot , a planter , and a judge . but when he headed a vigilante court to punish tories -lrb- british loyalists -rrb- during the american revolution , he decided to play the roles of jury and executioner , too . lynch has more than earned his besmirched name . in fact , he did half the besmirching himself by egotistically referring to his actions as  lynch law  and  lynching .  5 . shrapnel . while battling napoleon 's army , english general henry shrapnel -lrb- 1761 -- 1842 -rrb- noticed that original-flavor cannonballs just were n't massacring enough enemies for his liking . so , to get more shebang for his shilling , he filled the cannonballs with bullets and exploding charges . these  shrapnel shells ,  or  shrapnel-barrages ,  were pretty darn effective , and later designs proved even more successful in world war i. shrapnel did n't get much credit for the  innovation  during his lifetime , but he ultimately contributed to enough death and misery that he pretty much deserves to be synonymous with a violent , metallic byproduct of combat . 6 . draconian . a lexis-nexis news search shows that folks are still talking about  draconian policies ,   draconian penalties ,  and , most frighteningly ,  draconian sex rules .  though athenian lawgiver draco is not entirely confirmed to have existed , if he were real , then around 621 b.c.e. , he instituted two time-honored traditions : 1 -rrb- writing laws down and 2 -rrb- making laws that were batcrap-insane . they include ascribing the death penalty to such atrocities as being lazy , whizzing in an alley , and stealing an apple . apparently , he justified his measures with a sort of non-logic along the lines of ,  jaywalkers deserve to die , and i ca n't do anything worse to mass murderers . so what 're you gon na do ?  7 . boycott . in a nutshell ? boycott got boycotted . charles cunningham boycott -lrb- 1832 -- 1897 -rrb- was a retired english army captain who claimed his unwanted fame in 1880 when the irish land league decided to punish him for not lowering his rents . this then-new strategy , which was a mere paragraph in the russian-novel-size saga of irish land reform , was a kind of systematic shunning in which boycott was cut off from servants , supplies , mail , and lifestyle free of death threats . he might have been an evil landlord , but if boycott could see just how successful his name became , he 'd probably be a very sad , regretful , evil landlord . 8 . tawdry . the story of st. audrey -lrb- also known as st. etheldreda -rrb- is a classic example of how bad names happen to good people . st. audrey was the daughter of the king of east anglia -lrb- then the norfolk section of anglo-saxon england -rrb- , who lived a monastery-founding , self-abdicating life . but , when she died of the plague in 679 , she was sporting a pretty nasty-looking tumor on her neck , which gossipmongers blamed on her penchant for wearing audacious necklaces in her youth . after her death , silk scarves called  st. audrey laces  were sold in her honor at ely 's annual st. audrey 's fair . then the british tendency for dropping letters and syllables took over , and audrey became  tawdry .  it was a short trip from there to the dictionary , and tawdry has been synonymous with gaudy ever since . 9 . chauvinism . nicolas chauvin was an early 19th -- century french soldier who was so patriotic and nationalistic , he gave patriotism and nationalism a bad name -- or at least a new name . a slave to the cult of napoleon , chauvin shed his fair share of blood for the emperor . how did napoleon show his appreciation ? by giving chauvin a ceremonial saber , a ribbon , and a pittance of a pension . later , however , french dramatists began basing Ã¼ber-patriotic characters on chauvin , which paved the way for the soldier 's ultimate reward : a dubious spot in the english language . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
