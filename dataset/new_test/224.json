{"text": "pastor brady boyd calls it the  highlight of my ministry  -- seeing the parents of the man who shot up his church be embraced by the parents of two teenage sisters who were killed in the attack . a former roommate took this photo of matthew murray performing in a 2002 christmas program .  the four of them met and hugged and cried ,  said boyd , the senior pastor at new life church in colorado springs , colorado .  it made me evaluate my own life and think , ` is there anyone i 'm not forgiving ? '  boyd was referring to a meeting on january 3 between ron and loretta murray , whose 24-year-old son matthew carried out the december 9 attack at new life church , and david and marie works , whose daughters , stephanie , 18 , and rachael , 16 , were killed in the rampage . david works also was wounded in the shootings . learn more about the victims  the pastor said he invited the murrays to visit the new life campus after praying over the holidays . the family immediately accepted his invitation and was given a guided  step-by-step  tour of where the rampage took place and shown where their son died .  it was extremely emotional . they wanted to hear the details . i kept telling them i would stop with details , but they wanted to hear them ,  he told cnn in a phone interview this week . at one point , the parents also met with security guard jeanne assam , who shot their son in the leg before he turned his gun on himself . the parents thanked assam for her swift action and for helping save more lives , said casey nikoloric , a murray family spokeswoman and long-time friend .  they told assam that they were so deeply sorry she had to do what she did ,  said nikoloric .  there were tears , lots of embraces , prayers .  the visit , she said , was  very , very , very important  in the healing process for the murrays as they deal with the loss of their son and the terror he inflicted . boyd agreed .  i thought this would be best for the murrays ,  he said , adding that it touched everyone involved .  i 've never seen repentance and forgiveness as profound as i did that day .  the murrays toured the church with their other son , christopher , 20 , a student at oral roberts university . the murrays met the works in boyd 's office . he said he also asked the murrays to share  some of the good memories  of matthew as a boy .  it put it in context : this kid was raised in an upper middle-class home and had every chance to do well ,  boyd said .  you wonder what went wrong for matthew . they described matthew as any parent would describe their son .  the pastor said he did n't tell many people about the meeting before it happened , fearing it  could have gotten volatile and hostile .   it was risky , but i knew enough about the murrays to know they were mature and good people ,  he said . on sunday , he began his sermon by telling his congregation about what had transpired just a few days earlier . he was met with loud applause . matthew murray began his assault that day at the youth with a mission center in arvada , colorado , killing two people -- tiffany johnson , 26 , and philip crouse , 24 -- and wounding two others before he went to the new life church , about 80 miles away . the murrays visited the mission center december 12 and met with the families of the slain victims , according to nikoloric .  the depth of our sorrow and our grief is greater than we could possibly describe ,  the murrays said in a written statement .  but with thanks to god , these remarkable families and their pastors and churches , healing and reconciliation have begun .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
