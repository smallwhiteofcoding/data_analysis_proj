{"text": "washington state department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn iraq , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said friday . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice says that  people need to serve where they are needed .  rice was responding to foreign service officers ' objections to the possibility of  directed assignments  in iraq . the issue has caused an uproar in the state department , resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting wednesday . the new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers do n't step forward to fill open positions at the u.s. embassy in baghdad . if the state department enforces directed assignments , it will be the first time since the vietnam war era . one official called the order to serve in iraq  a potential death sentence  during the town meeting . the state department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates . those chosen will be given 10 days to respond , according to last week 's announcement . unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse , those who decline could face dismissal , it said . wednesday 's heated meeting was replayed on an internal state department television channel in washington several times and talked about widely . some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly , learning about it instead from news organizations last week . watch the diplomats exchange angry words   i just have no respect for the whole process because you 've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues ,  said foreign service officer jack croddy .  thank you for that comment . it 's full of inaccuracies , but that 's ok ,  harry thomas jr. , director general of the foreign service , shot back . others pointed out the risks of such assignments , considering the dangers of a war zone , lack of security and regular rocket attacks on u.s. personnel . rice , who did not attend the meeting , tried to calm things down friday by underscoring the state department 's attempts to do  everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats .  however , she said ,  this is one of the highest priority tasks of the united states , and we 're going to meet our obligations .  speaking to reporters en route to turkey and the mideast , she said ,  i do n't know if we will have direct assignments or not , but we are one foreign service , and people need to serve where they are needed .  the secretary sent out a cable to state department employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in iraq .  this year -lsb- u.s. ambassador ryan crocker -rsb- has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in iraq ,  rice said in the cable . rice said she has decided to go forward with the identification of officers to serve ,  should it prove necessary to direct assignments .   should others step forward , as some already have , we will fill these new jobs as we have before -- with volunteers . however , regardless of how the jobs may be filled , they must be filled ,  she said . rice earlier said reports that the state department was finding it hard to coax foreign service employees into iraq  could n't be further from the truth .  the assignments are new positions . fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for iraq service since the new policy was announced october 26 , department spokesman sean mccormack said . mccormack rejected comments by rep. duncan hunter , r-california , that state department employees are  nervous nellies  and that wounded u.s. military veterans should be asked to fill the iraq vacancies . mccormack said until now the state department has been successful in filling jobs in iraq with volunteers . since 2003 , more than 1,500 personnel have volunteered to go to iraq , he said . but with the expansion of the staff in iraq this year , 58 spots were left open .  they are serving in dangerous and challenging places ,  he said .  we have a lot of brave people who are stepping up to the plate in anbar and basra and baghdad and kabul and a lot of other places that are not necessarily in the headlines .  state department employees have been killed in iraq , but mccormack could not say how many . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's zain verjee and charley keyes contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
