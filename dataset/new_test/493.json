{"text": "baghdad , iraq the office of muqtada al-sadr accused iraqi and u.s. forces of attacking sadr city on friday , just hours after the shiite cleric called for calm in the wake of the assassination of one of his top aides in the southern city of najaf . iraqi sadrists march friday in the najaf funeral procession of sayyed riyadh al-nuri , top aide to muqtada al-sadr . witnesses and media in the heavily shiite baghdad neighborhood of sadr city , home to the cleric 's power base in the capital , reported heavy fighting between u.s.-backed iraqi troops and al-sadr 's mehdi army militia . the witnesses said u.s. aircraft had been bombarding the area for hours , and media reported rockets slamming into houses and many casualties . witnesses and al-sadr 's office said mosques were making loudspeaker announcements about mehdi army attacks on u.s. military armored vehicles . u.s. troops working in support of iraqi soldiers killed two snipers , two other men firing rocket-propelled grenades and  multiple others from a nearby building where soldiers were taking rpg and machine gun fire ,  the u.s. military said in a statement . at the same time -- about 9 p.m. -- at least six roadside bombs damaged vehicles in a u.s. army convoy that was transporting barriers for a group of iraqi army soldiers establishing a checkpoint , the military said . afterward , the military said , the iraqi and u.s. soldiers were attacked by small-arms , machine-gun and rpg fire from buildings overlooking the road . the soldiers fired back at their attackers , killing at least four of them . more explosions from the buildings indicated possible arms and munitions stored there , the military said . but the small-arms attack continued until the u.s. forces fired two rounds from an m1a2 abrams tank , killing two more attackers . not long afterward , the u.s. air force , operating an unmanned aerial vehicle , fired a hellfire missile at three men spotted setting roadside bombs , killing all three . maj. john gossart , executive officer of the american unit involved , said that no u.s. or iraqi troops were seriously hurt . earlier , al-sadr issued remarks about the killing of sayyed riyadh al-nuri , who was shot outside his house in najaf 's adala neighborhood after returning from friday prayers .  the hands of the occupiers and their collaborators have treacherously reached our beloved martyr sayyed riyadh al-nuri ,  al-sadr wrote in a statement on the web . al-nuri is one of 17 people killed over 24 hours in airstrikes , fighting and attacks in areas wracked in recent weeks by fighting among shiites . the assassination prompted an immediate vehicle ban in the shiite holy city of najaf , anger among mourners and an intensification of fighting in baghdad 's sadr city neighborhood . iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki issued a statement deploring the killing and ordering an investigation . al-sadr issued remarks about the killing in a statement on a web site . spokesman sheikh salah al-obeidi emphasized that the cleric is not accusing anyone in particular of the killing but believes that the killers  are the ones who are following the occupiers ' steps and do n't want stability for the country .  but al-obeidi called the killing an  act of provocation  after the  siege of sadr city .  he was referring to the battles since sunday involving members of al-sadr 's mehdi army militia and iraqi security forces dominated by a rival shiite political movement , the islamic supreme council of iraq . that fighting started with an offensive in basra and spread to other shiite regions , including sadr city and the babil provincial capital of hilla . the al-nuri assassination prompted officials to expand the daily curfew in hilla . police said a ban on all outside movement that usually begins at 11 p.m. and ends at 8 a.m. will instead start at 8:30 p.m. violence continued friday in several places in iraq . suicide bombings killed at least four people -- three of them police -- and wounded 15 , officials said . the first bombing was in ramadi , the provincial capital of the predominantly sunni anbar province west of baghdad , an interior ministry official said . at least three national police officers were killed and five wounded , the official said . the second attack took place at a checkpoint about 20 km -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- north of baiji , according to police , who said the bomber and one other person were killed and 10 were wounded . the casualties were members of a local awakening council who were manning the checkpoint , police said . the suicide bomber was driving a pickup carrying sheep . awakening councils , or sons of iraq , are made up of sunnis who have turned on al qaeda in iraq . also , at least three people were killed and five wounded in a mortar attack on baghdad 's palestine hotel , an interior ministry official said . the palestine hotel -- across the tigris river from the international zone , the heavily guarded seat of u.s. power in baghdad -- is in the path of many of the rockets and mortars aimed at the zone . the u.s. military has blamed iranian-backed shiite militants for recent mortar and rocket attacks in baghdad and international zone , also known as the green zone . unmanned aerial vehicles targeted and killed six suspected insurgents in basra on friday and six  heavily armed criminals  in northeastern baghdad on thursday night , the u.s. military said . watch the baghdad drone attack  the u.s. and iraqi militaries have consistently said they have not been targeting specific groups in their recent battles in shiite areas . iraqi and u.s. government officials say they differentiate between mehdi army members obeying al-sadr 's seven-month cease-fire pledge and  gangs ,   criminals  or  outlaws  who are n't obeying al-sadr 's orders . the intra-shiite fighting in iraq that has killed hundreds of people in the past two weeks has involved two main movements : members of the mehdi army militia loyal to al-sadr , and iraqi security forces dominated by the chief political rival of the sadrists , the islamic supreme council of iraq . many of those security forces had been integrated into police and army units from the council 's badr brigade militia . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's yousif bassil and jomana karadsheh contributed to this
