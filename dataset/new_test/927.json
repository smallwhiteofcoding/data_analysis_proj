{"text": "london , england rare images of an african animal so elusive that it was once believed to be mythical have been released . one of the first pictures of the elusive okapi was taken by camera trap . the okapi is a shy animal related to the giraffe , with zebra-like stripes on its rear . it is native to the tropical rainforests of africa but is now known to live only in the democratic republic of the congo . okapis were last seen in the drc 50 years ago , and the images are the first to capture the animal in the wild .  to have captured the first-ever photographs of such a charismatic creature is amazing ,  said noelle kumpel , manager of the bushmeat and forests conservation program at the zoological society of london , which took the pictures .  okapi are very shy and rare animals , which is why conventional surveys only tend to record droppings and other signs of their presence .  the okapi 's face and long legs resemble those of the giraffe , their closest-living relative , but they look more like horses with long necks . the average height of their shoulders is 1.6 meters -lrb- 5 feet , 3 inches -rrb- , the zsl says . they have a short , dense , velvety coat and dark prehensile tongue long enough to clean their own eyelids and ears . the new pictures show the okapi in the foliage of the drc 's virunga national park , where decades of economic collapse and armed conflict have threatened the diverse wildlife . in one image , an okapi looks curiously toward the camera amid the green trees and groundcover . its large ears , dark nose , and zebra stripes are clearly visible . the next shot shows the okapi walking away from the camera , giving a clear view of its striking black-and-white stripes on its rear legs . a third image released by zsl was taken at night and gives a vivid side view of the animal .  the photographs clearly show the stripes on their rear , which act like unique fingerprints ,  said theirry lusenge , a key member of zsl 's survey team in the drc .  we have already identified three individuals , and further survey work will enable us to estimate population numbers and distribution in and around the park , which is a critical first step in targeting conservation efforts .  zsl said the images prove the okapi still thrives in the park despite threats to its survival , which include poaching , deforestation , military camps inside the park , and the influx of refugees at the park 's borders . the animal 's exact status is still a mystery , however , and it remains under threat , the zsl said . okapi meat reportedly poached from the park is now regularly on sale at the nearby town of beni -- and if hunting continues at the same rate , okapi could become extinct within the park within a few years , the zsl said . the virunga national park is one of only three protected areas the okapi are known to inhabit , the zsl said . the zsl 's study of the okapi is part of a larger eu-funded conservation project in the park . though focused on okapi , the study has also managed to find other species including shrews and duikers , a kind of antelope , a zsl spokeswoman said . the study involved 18 cameras set up around the park by the zsl and the congolese institute for nature conservation , the spokeswoman said . the announcement comes a month after another group of researchers reported finding thousands of previously-unknown gorillas in the neighboring republic of congo . the u.s.-based wildlife conservation society said in august they had found 125,000 western lowland gorillas living in a swamp in northern congo , adding significantly to the existing worldwide population of the threatened species . okapi were well known by africans for centuries but the animal remained elusive , thanks to its acute hearing and effective camouflage , according to the national zoological gardens of south africa . nineteenth-century explorers sometimes caught a fleeting glimpse of the okapi 's striped backside as it ran through the forest , leading to speculation that it was a kind of zebra , the national zoological gardens says . it was known to the pygmy as a sacred animal . still , the okapi remained unknown to the western world until the early 20th century , when british explorer harry johnston went to congo and sent a complete skin and skull back to britain , the zsl said .", "summary": "no summary"}
