{"text": " to insure or not to insure ?  it is n't shakespeare , but it is the dramatic question hollywood filmmakers are asking about lindsay lohan following her legal troubles this week . lindsay lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled , but the cost will be high . it is an important question , too , because whether companies insure lohan 's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off hollywood 's a-list . but lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable , say underwriting experts . while some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars , experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison , even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost .  for a price , anything can be done , although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just wo n't be interested ,  said ross miller , partner with insurance brokerage d.r. reiff & associates inc. . lohan 's arrest this week in los angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left hollywood wondering if the actress , who shot to fame as a child in disney films like  the parent trap ,  is too risky to cast in a film . timeline : lindsay lohan 's troubles  it remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in  poor things ,  a film produced by and starring oscar-winner shirley maclaine . see a gallery of lohan 's films  a statement was expected early next week on whether the movie , already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by lohan , will proceed with or without her . insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations , although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of lohan and fellow troubled party girls paris hilton and britney spears .  i do n't think it -lrb- a problematic artist -rrb- is any more of an issue ,  said wendy diaz , entertainment underwriting director at fireman 's fund insurance co. , the leading film underwriter .  it 's pretty standard year to year .  but diaz did say the terms for covering lohan would likely be  serious at this point .  she said fireman 's fund , in such a case , would likely put in higher deductibles , or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted . last july , a producer on lohan 's last film ,  georgia rule ,  scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set , costing the movie 's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars . brian kingman , a managing director with entertainment insurance broker aon/albert g. ruben said covering situations like lohan 's required a lot of calculation and risk management . insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie 's production budget , which can range from $ 5 million to $ 100 million or more , he said .  filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk ,  kingman said . he said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance . in certain circumstances , drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples . in cases of known drug abuse ,  minders  are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor . kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration .  i have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules ,  he said , citing the case of robert downey jr. , another high-profile star with a history of legal , drug and alcohol problems . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .", "summary": "no summary"}
