{"text": "greensburg , kansas there are still piles of bricks and rubble on countless streets in greensburg , kansas , a year after a tornado demolished more than 90 percent of the town . on may 4 , 2007 , a ferocious twister blasted greensburg , kansas , killing 11 people in the town of 1,400 . yet what is happening in the city 's rebuilding process may not only re-invent greensburg but provide a model for  green  building everywhere . just a week after the deadly tornado hit may 4 , 2007 , a similar idea sparked in the mayor , a representative from the governor 's office and a nonprofit expert from a nearby town . the concept : if the whole town had to be rebuilt anyway , why not be bold and build it as a global example of conservation , energy efficiency and creativity ? daniel wallach , the nonprofit specialist , soon got the green light to help residents and businesses start over in a project known as greensburg greentown .  kansas is known for being very conservative ,  wallach said . watch how the town went green   my first order of business was to listen . what i heard were a lot of concerns about politicization and being associated with ` tree huggers . ' i helped frame it with the people here in such a way they saw , this is their movement ,  he said . fifth-generation greensburg resident anita hohl joined the staff of greensburg greentown as a web specialist .  i was pretty green to begin with . i used to get teased about being a tree hugger . now it 's ` the thing ! ' this has really brought us so much closer together . what you can accomplish when just a few people are working toward the same goal is amazing ,  she said . her farming grandparents instilled the virtue of being energy-efficient .  my grandma always put her clothes on the line , did her own gardening and re-used everything ,  hohl said . hohl and her husband , a daughter , a son , four cats , a dog and two birds are among the greensburg residents in  femaville ,  a cluster of mobile homes set up as temporary housing . the family hopes to break ground soon for their new house and move in by thanksgiving . although they have made the best of the cramped quarters , she says , there are some challenges .  it sort of feels like living in a cheap motel ! but it 's a lot better than it could be . it 's nice to have a place to be ,  she said . from the start , the greentown staff knew that getting the business community on board with the green plan was vital . and in rural america , there is no business that 's more of a bedrock than the john deere dealership . in greensburg , that dealership has been in the estes family for four generations . their facility was wiped out by the twister .  the building was a total loss . and we saved only 13 pieces of machinery out of 220 on the lot ,  kelly estes said .  the fema guy said he had never seen anything like it . steel twisted into brick , and then the miles per hour needed to pick up combines that weigh 25,000 pounds and move them half a mile in the air ,  he said . kelly and his brother mike decided to rebuild in town to the highest green-building standard . the u.s. green building council establishes a rating system for efficient buildings called leed , or leadership in energy and environmental design . the greensburg facility is aiming for leed platinum , the most demanding standard . there is one wind turbine on their new property , a 100-foot structure designed to generate 5 kilowatts of electricity . it is providing power for the construction site . although  green  may be viewed as trendy and new by some , mike estes knows that it is not for show .  we 're looking at saving money here ; truthfully , we are . we 're running a business . if we ca n't make this make sense , why would we do it ?  he asked . and he says the non-political approach of the city in encouraging energy efficiency has helped .  i do n't think it 's red or blue to be green ; i think green is green , and green makes sense . and green saves you green !  he said with a laugh . being a model for the world in energy efficiency is a major goal of greensburg greentown . but there is another even more urgent aim : keeping this rural town from disappearing . the lack of jobs in many small towns means that after teenagers graduate from high school , they have to leave to find other opportunities .  the average age of people living in rural communities is in their 50s ,  wallach said .  there are very few folks in the communities under that age , because there are just no jobs . families have been split up for decades .  so in addition to the long-term goal of greensburg 's pre-tornado businesses from leaving , people hope to attract new green trade as well . the city wants to open a biodiesel facility as one of its first green newcomers . another long-term goal is to have 100 percent renewable energy . it is probable that the greatest contribution would come from large wind turbines .  the timing of all this is , in some ways , almost spooky ,  wallach said .  it 's like the world was ready for this to happen , for a town to be completely re-imagined . the tragedy was terrible . but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
