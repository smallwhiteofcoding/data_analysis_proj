{"text": "london , england valerie gooding is in the top five most powerful businesswomen in europe as named by the financial times . she runs global health and care organization bupa and under her leadership it has grown to over 8 million customers in over 190 countries and record revenues . cnn 's todd benjamin spoke to her in london and began by asking her why there are so few women at the top . she said it goes beyond family issues . gooding : women sometimes do n't put themselves forward for things . and one of the things i think about and talk about a lot is that women often lack confidence to go for the next job , the top job . they sometimes do n't wish to compete or they do n't think they 're good enough for the next thing . benjamin : why do you think that is ? gooding : partly a lack of role models , partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family , in work . but also i think there is still -- i do n't like to call it a glass ceiling , but i think there is still an unseen barrier for women , which is that , if you ask most business people , would they like to promote more women , they would all say yes , they 'd love to :  where are these women , i want to promote them ,  will be the answer . but often they do n't really automatically think of a woman first for a top job . benjamin : and what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top ? gooding : well , first of all , to learn as much as you can and to make sure you 've got the right experience , the right qualifications , and to enjoy each job for its own interest and job satisfaction . but i think another piece of advice i would give to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want , because i think one thing that happens with women , which perhaps is a gender difference , is that women often hang back and think  i will be noticed for my results , everybody will see how great i am because i 've delivered these exceptional outcomes  . but actually life is n't like that , you have to tell people about your results and your achievements , and men are often better at doing that than women are . benjamin : what do you think separates good leadership from great leadership ? gooding : well , i think good leaders should be judged on their results . and i think of a good leader you should be able to say  she transformed the business ,   she upped the performance ,   she exceeded the expectations of the stakeholders .  i think of a great leader i would go to that old chinese saying ,  of a great leader the people will say  we did it ourselves   . benjamin : do you think that women in general as managers are more inclusive than men ? gooding : no , i do n't . in fact , i sometimes find these gender differences , when sort of represented in the business environment , are actually just not very useful . i think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and i do n't think it goes down to straightforward gender divide . because i have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial , and i 've equally seen men who are very consultative . so , i do n't just think it divides that way . benjamin : you clearly love what you do . what is it about business that you think is such a buzz ? gooding : it 's the constant challenge , there 's always something new , there 's a new competitor , there 's a new pressure , there 's a new opportunity , there 's a new challenge , i think that 's what keeps us all going . i think it 's the thrill of the chase , basically . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
