{"text": "tehran , iran iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki on sunday tried to allay iranian fears over a planned u.s.-iraq security pact , saying his government would not allow iraq to become a launching pad for an attack on its neighbor . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , left , greets iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki on sunday .  iraq today does n't present any threat as it used to be in the times of the former regime ,  al-maliki told iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad during a sunday meeting between two leaders , according to a statement from the prime minister 's office .  today 's iraq is a constitutional state based on the rule of law , and it seeks to develop its relations with the regional countries based on cooperation and mutual respect ,  al-maliki said . earlier , iran 's state-run news agency irna quoted the iraqi leader as saying that  baghdad would not allow its soil to be used as a base to damage the security of the neighboring countries , including iran .  his remarks come as the united states and iraq are trying to reach a bilateral agreement on how long the u.s. military will remain in iraq and what role it will play in iraq 's security . but al-maliki media adviser ali hadi said negotiations between iraq and the united states are in their  very early stages  and were not part of sunday 's talks . watch ahmadinejad and al-maliki sit down for talks   the treaty is purely an iraqi-american treaty . the iranians have nothing to do with it ,  hadi said .  we will not discuss the progress or the key elements of agreements or disagreements with them because this is an iraqi issue .  the proposed u.s.-iraqi pact has triggered street protests in iraq , where many suspect the deal could lead to the establishment of permanent american bases , a long-term presence of u.s. troops and a weakening of iraqi government control over those troops . shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr , whose militia was the target of a u.s.-backed iraqi clampdown in basra and baghdad recently , has called for weekly protests against the agreement . al-maliki and ahmadinejad met sunday afternoon , with ahmadinejad calling on iraq 's neighbors and the united nations to help restore security and stability to iraq , irna reported . and al-maliki thanked ahmadinejad for his call for an end to longstanding u.n. sanctions against iraq that date back to the 1991 persian gulf war . iran has long called for the withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq , which the united states invaded in 2003 . meanwhile , the united states has accused iran of arming and training  criminal  shiite militias in iraq and of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , allegations the iranians deny . it is al-maliki 's third visit to iran since he became prime minister more than two years ago . the two countries , which are neighbors , both have shiite muslim majorities , and al-maliki 's ruling coalition is dominated by shiite religious parties long backed by iran . adnan pachachi , a leading sunni arab member of iraq 's parliament , told cnn he wanted al-maliki to call on iran to stop supporting armed factions in iraq .  i think this has to stop ,  pachachi told cnn .  i hope that mr. maliki will make it absolutely clear that iraqis of all parties , of all sectarian origins and ethnic origins , are strongly opposed to iran 's attempt to interfere in iraq 's affairs .  pachachi , a former foreign minister , said al-maliki 's predecessor , ibrahim al-jaafari , allowed iraq 's security forces to be dominated by sectarian and ethnic militias , and that u.s. troops should remain until those influences are weeded out .  in the long run , it is in the interest of the united states to have a secure iraq and armed forces and security forces of iraq with undivided loyalty and allegiance to the state and not influenced by sectarian affiliations or party loyalties ,  he said .", "summary": "no summary"}
