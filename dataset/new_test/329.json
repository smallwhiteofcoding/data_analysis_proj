{"text": "humble woodcutter mohammed sultan nafeek 's teenage daughter moved to saudi arabia to work as a housemaid to support her family after they were displaced by the 2004 tsunami . now she is on death row , and all he can do is pray . razeena mohammad -lrb- left -rrb- and mohammad sultan nafeek , parents of rizana nafeek . rizana , who was 17 when she started work in saudi arabia , was convicted of killing a 4-month-old baby boy in her care just two weeks into her job . nafeek says the child died accidentally , choking on milk . his daughter was sentenced to beheading in a case rights groups say underlines the vulnerability of many of the 1.5 million sri lankans who work abroad -- nearly 400,000 of them in saudi arabia alone .  our family was suffering hardship , and so our daughter volunteered to go and work abroad to send money home ,  nafeek told reuters by telephone from his modest home in mutur in sri lanka 's war-torn northeast . after the december 2004 tsunami forced them from their home , the family was displaced again by renewed civil war between the state and separatist tamil tiger rebels . nafeek visited saudi arabia with sri lanka 's deputy foreign minister this month in a bid to secure clemency and met with relations of the dead child 's parents but came away empty handed . under saudi law , a pardon is the gift of the family of the victim , and so far the parents of the dead child have refused to meet either the family or sri lankan officials .  the cops told us : ` go and pray to allah . if you can get the forgiveness of the parents , your daughter will be free , '  he said .  so i am praying all the time .   if we had been able to meet the parents , we are sure they would have been willing to forgive our daughter after seeing our situation .  the sri lankan government is investigating the agency that sent rizana to work abroad when she was technically still a child but remains hopeful she will be pardoned or exonerated .  i am fairly confident ,  said deputy foreign minister hussein bhaila .  we have spoken to tribal leaders of their particular tribe , we have spoken to area officials ... it is they who will now have to speak -lrb- to the parents -rrb- .   his excellency the president -lrb- mahinda rajapaksa -rrb- has been following this case very keenly . this is an exceptional case because of her tender age ,  he added . rights groups accuse the government of failing to protect its expatriate workers -- one of the main sources of foreign-exchange revenues for the $ 23 billion economy -- with legal aid . they also decry saudi arabia 's legal system .  this case raises many troubling questions about the treatment of children and foreigners in saudi arabia 's criminal-justice system ,  human rights watch said in a statement issued overnight .  international law prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18 .  saudi arabia executed four sri lankans convicted of armed robbery earlier this year , and did not inform sri lankan authorities beforehand . sri lanka reinstated its own death penalty in 2004 after the murder of a high court judge , but it has been dormant since 1976 . there is no indication any of the dozens of convicted murderers , rapists and drug smugglers on death row in sri lanka and effectively serving life prison terms will actually be executed . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .", "summary": "no summary"}
