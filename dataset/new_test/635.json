{"text": "austrian investigators monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where josef fritzl kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years , along with three of their children . josef fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children . investigators believe fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978 , shortly after , according to his daughter , he began raping her at age 11 or 12 , said police spokesman franz polzer . the 73-year-old austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year , and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- polzer said . it took fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition , polzer said . investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison , which was blocked by a 500-kilogram -lrb- 1,100-pound -rrb- steel and concrete door that fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance , polzer said . fritzl , who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar , had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison .  you would have to open up a total of eight doors , and ... -lrb- for the -rrb- last door which would go into this space -lrb- where the family was imprisoned -rrb- , you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus ,  polzer said .  we will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we have n't discovered yet , and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting .  fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter , elisabeth , captive in the dungeon under the fritzl home for decades , repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived . three of the children were adopted by josef fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep . the story of the family 's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago , when one of the children still in the dungeon , 19-year-old kerstin fritzl , fell seriously ill with convulsions . the father agreed to take her to a hospital , the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers . dr. albert reiter , who is treating kerstin , said monday that while her condition is still  grave ,  it  has improved somewhat .   she has become more stable , but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help ,  reiter said , noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation . elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother , rosemarie , who police say knew nothing about the basement prison . they were also reunited with the three children that josef had taken from elisabeth . the reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic , where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic 's chief doctor .  the mother and the smallest child have , in just the last couple of days , increased their sensitivity to light ,  dr. berthold kepplinger said .  so we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses .  five-year-old felix is  getting more and more lively ,  kepplinger said .  he 's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air , the light , and the food -- all of these things are helping them ,  he said .  slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal -lrb- shade -rrb- .  he also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family . kepplinger praised elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity . he said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family , and the children make their beds . however , he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in fritzl 's home . he said the mother , elisabeth , takes breaks and naps several times a day . the health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying , kepplinger said . kepplinger said the children , after being confined to a small space their entire lives , are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces . initially the dungeon where fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters . in 1993 , around the time elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child , fritzl decided to add to the dungeon , building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters . on wednesday or thursday , prosecution authorities will attempt to question fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession , state prosecutor gerhard sedlacek said . a warden at the st. poelten jail , where fritzl is being held , told cnn that fritzl appears to be doing well , but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
