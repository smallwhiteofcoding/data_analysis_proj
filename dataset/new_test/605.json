{"text": "she 'll never forget the day her 17-year-old son , john , asked her permission to enlist in the u.s. military .  mom , i owe this to my country .  samantha schroeder of chester , maryland , worries about her 19-year-old son , john , who is deploying to iraq . now , at age 19 , her son is a marine preparing to deploy to iraq .  he does n't care if you do or do n't understand his choice ; he is n't concerned with political views , religion or race . his greatest concern is doing the job he is asked to do with skill and pride , protecting those abroad and at home and standing up to the standards he has set for himself ,  samantha schroeder said . ireporters shared an array of stories about how the iraq war has affected them over the past five years . one man said he met his wife , a fellow service member , while serving in iraq . others described the pain of having fathers so far away , especially when new children are born . some military wives said they often keep their true feelings to themselves , fearing that they would affect their husbands ' morale in the field . see photos , hear stories of sacrifice  below are a selection of responses from ireporters , some of which have been edited for length and clarity . angela fritz of fort hood , texas  having -lsb- my husband -rsb- gone is the worst kind of pain . it is the burden i chose to bear but am not happy to . on the outside , i have to stand strong . i have to support my country and my husband , regardless of what i feel . that is the army way . i am so proud of him for having the courage to step up and serve his country . on the inside , i am angry and worn thin . of course , i want my husband home , but it 's so much more than that now .  samantha schroeder of chester , maryland  i am the mother of a 19-year-old marine . he joined while still in his senior year . when he came to me to sign his enlistment papers , i was hesitant . no , i was downright , ` not in a million years . ' he was only 17 . how could i give him permission ? just wait , i asked , and think about it some more . he looked at me with a mixture of fear in thinking i might not sign and anger in knowing i did n't understand . and what he said next has stuck in my head through all his training , and now he leaves in a week for iraq . he told me , ` mom , i owe this to my country . ' ...  now , as he prepares for iraq deployment , i am a little better prepared for what the future holds mentally . but to me , he and most of the men who will accompany him are so young . they still seem like boys to me , but i know they are men . willing to serve their country . i remember 9/11 like it was yesterday , and i also remember the fear that was on that seventh-grader 's face when he was bused home early that day and watched the events unfold on the tv . and now he stands as a marine , willing to sacrifice his everyday freedoms to assure we are safe here at home .  katherine shigekane of virginia beach , virginia  the iraq war has changed our lives in many ways . my husband has been serving in the navy for 16 years , and since march 2003 , he has been on four different deployments . our lives have been affected in many ways . our wedding plans were changed due to the invasion . he missed most of my first pregnancy . he was able to be home for the birth of our twins but left again when they were a year old and was gone until after their second birthday . he is now gone again . ... as a family i think we have learned to appreciate the time we do spend together .  joshm  while serving in iraq with the united states marines , i met my wife . she is in the united states army . we met while on r&r in qatar . we did long distance for the remaining time that we had left of our deployment and then another year while i was still stationed in cherry point , north carolina . she is still stationed at fort campbell , kentucky . after i separated from the marines as a corporal , i moved to kentucky to be with her . we are now happily married , and she is on her third tour to iraq . so even though the news shows all the bad things of war , some good really does come from it .  christopherm  i am a soldier in the u.s. army . i am a 20-year-old combat veteran . i returned home this past summer and enrolled in college with hopes of going to law school . unfortunately , with future deployments likely to postpone my schooling , i will be in college long past traditional college years . that is just a minor nuisance compared with the fact that relating to my family and friends is infinitely more difficult since i 've returned . i find myself zoning out and going back to the war during family functions and when i 'm out with my friends , i apparently talk in my sleep about the war and occasionally sleepwalk .  sierra derrick of waymart , pennsylvania  this is the second time my husband is deploying to iraq , and trust me , it only gets harder !! the first time , i was 17 years old , two months pregnant and a brand-new bride . -lrb- we got married literally the day before he left . -rrb- now , exactly four years later , we are in the same situation , although things are a little different . together we have two amazingly beautiful little boys , connor and carson , ages 3 and 1 . needless to say , he is their hero as well as mine .  the impact that this war has had on our family has been extraordinary . we are so incredibly proud of him in ways that civilian families could n't comprehend . we have been brought closer because of these deployments , and the support we have is absolutely phenomenal .  in that sense , i believe it has been worth it .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
