{"text": "washington as he awaits a crucial progress report on iraq , president bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out . president bush pauses tuesday during a news conference at the north american leaders summit in canada . on wednesday in kansas city , missouri , bush will tell members of the veterans of foreign wars that  then , as now , people argued that the real problem was america 's presence and that if we would just withdraw , the killing would end ,  according to speech excerpts released tuesday by the white house .  three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left ,  bush will say .  whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , '  the president will say . the president will also make the argument that withdrawing from vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising u.s. credibility , citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam , according to the excerpts .  here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility , but the terrorists see things differently ,  bush will say . on tuesday , democratic senate majority leader harry reid said ,  president bush 's attempt to compare the war in iraq to past military conflicts in east asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two . our nation was misled by the bush administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of iraq under false pretenses , leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history .  while the president continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in iraq , paid for by the taxpayers , american lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the iraqi government . it is time to change direction in iraq , and congress will again work to do so in the fall .  the white house is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the american legion , as an effort to  provide broader context  for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop  surge  in iraq until the report comes out in september . watch bush criticize the iraqi government  it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush in wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from asia , including the u.s. defeat and occupation of japan after world war ii and the korean war in the 1950s , according to the excerpts .  in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom ,  bush will say .  today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies .  speaking about the korean war , bush will note that at the time  critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that america 's intervention was divisive here at home .   while it is true that the korean war had its share of challenges , america never broke its word ,  bush will say .  without america 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the south koreans after the war , millions of south koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
