{"text": "washington justice department officials blocked liberals and people with democratic party ties from a highly selective program that funneled young lawyers into government jobs , according to an internal investigation released tuesday . a bias against liberals existed in a justice program meant to hire young lawyers , an investigation found . esther slater mcdonald , a political appointee at the justice department ,  wrote disparaging statements about the candidates ' liberal and democratic party affiliations on the applications she reviewed and ... she voted to deselect candidates on that basis ,  said the report by inspector general glenn fine . mcdonald , who has left the department , refused to be interviewed for the investigation . the report , the first official investigation to document politicization of the justice department during the bush administration , is an offshoot of the larger investigation of justice department politics triggered by the furor over the firing of nine u.s. attorneys . it found two of three members of a screening committee considered political views and experience when choosing new lawyers for the justice department honors program and summer law intern program . the report found that mcdonald and michael elston , the chief of staff to deputy attorney general paul mcnulty , engaged in misconduct , an administrative violation . the third member of the screening committee , career lawyer dan fridman , was cleared of any involvement in the politicization of the process . elston was interviewed by the investigators , who asked him about the role of former justice department official monica goodling in politicizing the selection process . elston told investigators he could not recall goodling telling him to select lawyers who appeared to share attorney general alberto gonzales ' philosophy . goodling testified before a house panel last year that she had told elston he should identify such candidates . goodling directed elston to lead the selection committee in 2006 . she and elston have both left the justice department . she refused to be interviewed for the inspector general 's report . as a result of the controversy , the hiring process was changed in 2007 to insulate hiring decisions from political considerations . both justice department policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations . the report did not find clear evidence that an earlier screening committee took political considerations into account . it says data from 2002 shows a disparity in the hiring of liberal and conservative candidates , but there were no complaints about the committee 's work from 2003 to 2006 , when goodling put elston in charge of the process . the report tuesday is the first of perhaps several to be issued as the broad-ranging investigation into the role partisan politics has played in the justice department during the bush administration . goodling is expected to be a central figure in later inspector general reports examining efforts to increase the influence of conservatives in the department . the justice department office of professional responsibility , a separate watchdog office that monitors prosecutorial conduct , joined in the inspector general 's investigation . cnn 's terry frieden contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
