{"text": "beirut , lebanon the fiery leader of lebanon 's hezbollah militant movement assured lebanon on monday that his movement will cooperate in the country 's political life . supporters carry posters of hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah . hassan nasrallah said :  we do n't want to have control over lebanon , or to have governance over lebanon or to impose our ideas over the people of lebanon , because we believe lebanon to be a special and diverse country that needs the collaboration of everyone .  nasrallah spoke a day after lebanon 's parliament elected michel sleiman the country 's president after a six-month vacancy in the position . nasrallah , speaking at a packed stadium , told his followers :  i renew my appeal and invitation for a true national partnership with no eliminations or impositions . the national unity government is not the victory of the opposition against the pro-government . it is the victory of all lebanese .  he said sleiman 's election  renews the hope amongst the lebanese people to a new era and a new start .   i must say that there are deep wounds from our side and theirs , we are both in front of two choices ; either to expand the wounds and add salt to them or try to cure them for the sake of lebanon and we prefer the second choice .  the parliament had tried 19 times to vote on a new president , but failed because of disagreements over how to share power in a new cabinet . lebanon 's western-backed government and the hezbollah-led opposition reached a deal last week aimed at ending an 18-month political crisis that pushed the country to the brink of civil war , and paved the way for sleiman 's election . the agreement , reached in doha , qatar , calls for a consensus government in which the cabinet would be comprised of 30 posts -- 16 for the majority , 11 for the hezbollah-led opposition and three set aside for the president to nominate . the seat allocation had been a key sticking point for the opposition , which wanted to ensure it had the power to veto major decisions . with 11 cabinet posts , it will have that power . in exchange for the veto power and a redistricting plan ahead of next year 's elections , hezbollah agreed to end its sit-in protest that has paralyzed downtown beirut since late 2006 . in his speech , sleiman expressed gratitude to qatar and to the arab league for helping broker the deal . sleiman was the consensus candidate , and is viewed as a neutral party by lebanon 's political factions . the nation 's previous presidents have been seen as either pro-syrian or pro-western . in his 10 years as chief of the army , sleiman also is believed to have unified the splintered military . however , he inherits a nation grappling with divisions . lebanon 's elected , pro-western government has long been locked in a power struggle with hezbollah . in public statements and demonstrations in recent years , hezbollah threatened to use its power and popularity to oust the sunni-led government , triggering fears of a new civil war that could further destabilize the volatile region . the election helped end a political crisis that deteriorated into violence this month . that crisis was defused when the lebanese government gave in to two key hezbollah demands -- lifting a government ban of hezbollah 's telecommunications system and reinstating the chief of security at beirut 's airport .  the performance of the opposition proved that it did not organize a coup , but only wanted the illegal government to withdraw its two decisions ,  nasrallah said .  i promise that the opposition 's representation in the government will not be monopolized by hezbollah , amal and the change and reform bloc . we will give other opposition parties shares - and unfortunately we must speak of shares - even if it is at the expense of hezbollah 's shares .  hezbollah has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks against u.s. , israeli , and other western targets and the united states lists it as a terrorist organization . but many in lebanon and other parts of the middle east -- particularly shiites -- view hezbollah militants as freedom fighters .", "summary": "no summary"}
