{"text": "croatia held off a furious late onslaught from euro 2008 co-hosts austria to win 1-0 in their opening group b match in vienna on sunday . emmanuel pogagtetz , left , fouls croatia striker ivica olic to concede the match-winning penalty . the croatians took the lead in the fourth minute when midfielder luka modric coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after emmanuel pogatetz clumsily body-checked striker ivica olic in the area . slaven bilic 's team dominated the first half , and should have gone further ahead in the 35th minute but olic 's strike partner mladen petric blazed over the bar with a left-foot volley after beating the offside trap to run on to vedran corluka 's cross . austria 's main threat had come from set-pieces , but they were not able to capitalize on a string of corners . however , the home players kept battling in the second half and squandered a series of chances to level the score in the final 15 minutes . martin harnik fired over the bar on 78 as croatia scrambled to clear the danger , then substitute ivica vastic had a powerful header well saved by goalkeeper stipe pletikosa , who then kept out another low effort by the veteran midfielder . pletikosa also had to deny a driven shot from umit korkmaz , who also came off the bench , while another substitute in roman kienast flicked a header just wide from a free kick in the third minute of time added on . croatia went into the tournament as one of the outside bets , having qualified top of their group ahead of russia with a victory away to england which eliminated the british team . however , their chances of success were dealt a massive blow when top scorer eduardo da silva was ruled out of the tournament due to a broken leg . none of croatia 's strikers managed to score in the warmup matches , and the arsenal forward 's goal-poaching ability was sorely missed on sunday . the winning goal came after modric and olic combined down the left wing from a throw-in , and pogatetz clearly impeded the striker well away from the austria goal . the middlesbrough defender was booked for protesting the referee 's decision , but he could have no complaints with the ruling . austria are the lowest-ranked of the 16 teams at the tournament in 92nd place , but showed great courage against a 15th-seeded croatia side stacked with attacking talent . but they joined fellow co-hosts switzerland in losing their opening match , following the czech republic 's 1-0 victory on saturday . croatia next play germany on thursday , when austria take on poland . coach bilic was delighted to start with a victory , but was not so impressed with his team 's performance .  some players were overwhelmed by playing at a great tournament but we started off with the best possible way -- with a win ,  bilic told reporters .  in the first 35 minutes we played excellently , of course the early lead contributed to that .  they exerted more pressure in the second half and i 'm sure that is not to do with a lack of strength from our players . but we confined ourselves to our penalty area too early .  the last 15 minutes or so when they play all or nothing , you can do that -- but we started in the 60th minute or so . i did n't think the players were happy when they got back in the dressing room . i turned on the cd player and said they should sing because they won .  austria coach josef hickersberger was left frustrated by his side 's failure to take their chances .  this was the worst possible start you can have in an opening match of a major tournament ,  he said .  we took some time to recover , during the first 30 minutes we were nervous .  for the rest of the match we were playing the way we should have been playing . we even dominated in the second half of the match . we had good opportunities but unfortunately we were n't able to score a goal , so we are empty-handed . in our remaining games we need four points to go through .  austria : jurgen macho ; sebastian proedl , emanuel pogatetz , martin stranzl ; joachim standfest , rene aufhauser , andreas ivanschitz , jurgen saumel , ronald gercaliu ; martin harnik , roland linz . croatia : stipe pletikosa ; ivan corluka , robert kovac , josip simunic , danijel pranjic ; darijo srna , niko kovac , luka modric , niko kranjcar ; ivica olic , mladen petric .", "summary": "no summary"}
