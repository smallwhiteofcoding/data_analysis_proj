{"text": "boise , idaho firefighter jonathan frohreich had never heard of the wildland firefighter foundation , much less its founder , until recovering from severe work-related injuries last month . vicki minor 's wildland firefighter foundation has granted more than $ 1.5 million in aid to more than 500 families . as he lay in his hospital bed in sacramento , california , vicki minor put her hand on his shoulder .  she introduced herself and told me that she was there to help ,  recalls frohreich , who had been in a helicopter crash that killed nine of his colleagues .  she just said , ` anything . ' she was there to do anything for me .  since 1999 , minor has dedicated herself to providing emergency assistance and ongoing support to injured and fallen wildfire fighters and their families nationwide through her wildland firefighter foundation . wildland firefighters are called into action when the united states ' vast natural resources are threatened by fire . for frohreich , minor 's foundation supplied lodging and food for family and friends who visited his bedside . it also provided emergency funds for medical and other expenses , arranged for frohreich to meet with firefighters who carried him to safety , and brought his fallen comrades ' family members to a bereavement ceremony .  she means everything ,  frohreich said .  she 's one of the best things to ever happen .  minor first became involved with the wildland firefighter community 21 years ago after witnessing a wildfire for the first time .  i had never seen anything like it ,  minor recalls of the blaze in the mountains of idaho .  all those firefighter units mobilized in camps that cropped up . it was like an invasion , and i was mesmerized .  minor started a fire camp commissary , providing dry goods , clothing and necessities to the firefighters . but it was n't until tragedy struck in 1994 at storm king mountain , colorado , where 14 firefighters perished in a single day , that minor was overcome with a need to assist the families . the storm king fire was a turning point .  fighting fire is much like fighting a war . there 's no time to tend to the injured , or tend to the dead . the fire does n't stop raging ,  minor said .  i looked up at the heavens and i said to those kids , ` help me help your families . '  grieving wildland families , like those of fallen soldiers , tend to be young and scattered throughout the country , often enduring their sudden loss in isolation from their firefighting community . taking cues from a visit to the vietnam veterans memorial in washington , d.c. , minor spearheaded fundraising efforts for the erection of the wildland firefighters monument in boise , idaho , which contains markers  for almost every wildland firefighter that has fallen ,  minor said .  i had seen and felt the healing of those combat veterans that would touch a name of their friend ,  minor said .  our wildland firefighters had nothing like that to process their grief . i wanted to create a place where our families could congregate , reach out in solidarity and comfort to honor their fallen and injured .  watch minor describe the sculptures in the firefighter monument  since 1999 , the foundation has continued to grow , assisting more than 500 wildland firefighters and their families with more than $ 1.5 million in emergency funds and services , including communication support ; travel and lodging for the injured and fallen ; and emotional and benefit counseling and advocacy . watch minor describe how her foundation takes action to aid wildfire fighters   there is a need for these families to be taken care of , and a long-term need ,  minor said .  but most of it is to maintain that home until benefits come in .  when survivors suddenly lose their income and do n't know how to apply for the compensation they 're entitled to , minor 's foundation steps in to guide them , often fighting for them when benefits are delayed or denied . watch minor explain why her foundation fights for firefighters and their families  minor says she hopes the wildland firefighters know  we have their back .   i hope that they feel they can go on and fight that fire and know that we 'll take care of their family and their friends .
