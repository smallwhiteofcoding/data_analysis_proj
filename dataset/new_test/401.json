{"text": "do you live in one of the nation 's worst cities for road rage ? if you live in a major metropolitan area on either coast , chances are you do . if you live in the midwest or northwest , odds are that you do n't . miami ranks as the worst city for most aggressive drivers for the second straight year in a nationwide study of driver habits followed by new york , boston , los angeles and washington . but if road rage is a  cultural phenomenon  as one of our experts suggests , how best do we go about combating driver frustration across the nation ? traffic black spots . the nation 's roads are peppered with traffic black spots , junctions where car snarls elicit road rage in even the most mild-mannered drivers . southern california has the san diego -lrb- i-405 -rrb- freeway , and the nation 's busiest junction , where u.s. 101 meets it to the north of los angeles . miami and the east coast have i-95 , which snakes from the world 's busiest cruise port up to maine . the district of columbia and the beltway are infamous for gridlock . i 've spent three very nervous hours getting to chicago 's o'hare airport from the city center -lrb- before missing my flight -rrb- . traffic by definition is worst in major metropolitan areas -- if your farming community is gridlocked , you 'd better be grousing at your local council meetings -- but it is the increase in traffic that leads many to suggest it 's just going to get worse . traffic levels are rising seemingly as fast as home foreclosures in los angeles and miami . in these areas , it 's not only the rise in number of drivers , but the rising age of drivers . aaa points out that seniors are the fastest growing demographic in the u.s. . that suggests drivers should adjust their habits accordingly . aaa has launched its lifelong safe mobility campaign to help seniors adjust to more crowded roads and perhaps more aggressive drivers . the facts and remedy . when the aaa foundation for traffic safety studied more than 10,000 incidents of road rage and violent aggressive driving committed in the 1990s , it found that at least 218 people were killed and another 12,610 injured when drivers got angry . many of these aggressors are males aged 18 to 26 . the aaa web site offers a three-step plan to avoid becoming the victim of aggressive driving : . • the first tip is  do n't offend ,  which includes cutting off other drivers , driving slowly in the left lane , tailgating and gesturing to other drivers . • the agency then warns to  not engage ,  which advises steering clear of trouble , not making eye contact and getting help , by calling 911 , in the event of experiencing dangerous , aggressive driving . it then asks at-risk drivers to  adjust their attitude ,  which involves  forgetting winning  -lrb- for the drivers to whom driving is a darwinian survival of the fittest -rrb- , or putting themselves in the other drivers ' shoes . • finally , they recommend that , if you think you have a road rage problem , seek professional help . other people 's actions . so the wife and i were looking for sofas . it was a sunday morning and , with me behind the wheel , we were dawdling around quiet streets trying to find one of those seemingly ubiquitous furniture warehouses . soon , the wife pointed one out but we were almost past it . i hit the brakes and quickly pulled in , then realized that a mercedes m-class had pulled in right behind me . a large , squat tattooed guy jumped out and started shouting , about 10 feet from my car .  i have children in the car , i had to slam on the brakes , -lsb- how dare -rsb- you brake so quickly ,  he said , getting real mean . i appreciated i 'd probably braked quickly and that it was bad driving on my part . however , as his tirade continued , i very calmly asked why he was setting such a bad example for his young children by following another driver off the road , then shouting and swearing . the man continued his harangue before climbing back into his vehicle and driving away . the next time you 're fulminating in your front seat about another 's aggressive driving , remember that your driving will almost inevitably elicit the same response in someone else . and do n't swear in front of your kids or set a bad example for them . ` cultural phenomenon ' dr. leon james is a professor of psychology at the university of hawaii and web master of drdriving.org . he is also the co-author of  road rage and aggressive driving  with this wife , diane nahl . james began studying driving psychology about 20 years ago after his wife told him her mother thought he took turns too fast . over a period of self-study , he said he was amazed by the mistakes he made and the aggressive thoughts he experienced toward other drivers . he recorded them via his  speakaloud  method . using his method on students , he discovered that road rage is a  cultural phenomenon .   we call the back seat of the car the ` road rage nursery ' , where -lsb- young children -rsb- pick up all the driver 's bad habits ,  james said .  it 's a cultural temper tantrum .  james said  local norms  can play a part . for example , florida drivers yell at each other more than in california , where verbal interplay can be interpreted as road rage in a criminal court . but , in the main , it 's  drivers trying to deal with their emotions in stressful situations .  james said that , in his studies , an awareness gap exists in aggressive drivers : when asked about drivers ' habits , respondents suggested that about 85 percent of other drivers drove aggressively , while just 35 percent said they themselves drove aggressively . if you feel your blood boiling frequently behind the wheel , classes like james ' are sprouting all over the nation . addressing road rage . in an ideal world , an increase in drivers would automatically be met by an improvement in infrastructure , and fewer road-rage-inducing distractions . another utopian ideal is for everyone else to drive more considerately . one look at our nation 's crumbling roads tells us that this fantasyland clearly does n't exist . instead of looking outside your car at road conditions or the habits of other drivers , the answer to aggressive driving , most likely , lies within the confines of your own cabin . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no
