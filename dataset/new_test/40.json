{"text": "abeche , chad most of the 103 children that a french charity attempted to take to france from chad for adoption are neither sudanese nor orphans , three international aid agencies reported on thursday . hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-french slogans wednesday in abeche , chad . six members of zoe 's ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to france , where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in . three french journalists , a seven-member spanish flight crew and one belgian were also arrested . representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with zoe 's ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission . chadian president idriss deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed , his chief of staff , mahamat hissene , said thursday . the president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of abeche , where the children were taken , to a judge in n'djamena , the capital , hissene said . the transfer will take place monday , according to media reports . the international red cross committee , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees and unicef said most of the children were living with their families before zoe 's ark took them . the charity said the children were sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation . the agencies said most of the children also probably come from chadian villages along chad 's border with sudan . the children have been living in an orphanage in abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities . watch a report on whether the children are orphans  chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities . chad 's interior minister said zoe 's ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help . the charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted . the spaniards and belgian are charged with complicity . the spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released , a company executive said thursday .  we thought we were doing a humanitarian transport ,  said antoni cajal , sales director of spain 's gir jet charter firm .  if an ngo -lsb- nongovernmental organization -rsb- has done something wrong , it 's impossible for us to know .  spain 's foreign ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to chad to try to win the group 's release . over the weekend , the captain appealed urgently to be rescued , fearing the crew could be harmed or killed , cajal said . but the four women and three men are in good condition in custody , cajal said , based on his conversations with a spanish consular official who came from cameroon to chad and has been able to visit them . the detention is the first problem of its kind for the company , which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue , cajal said . on its web site , zoe 's ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in paris that sends teams of physicians , nurses , firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in france , who then apply for asylum on their behalf . the red cross , unhcr and unicef said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10 , and they are healthy . the agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds .  so far , the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from chadian villages near the cities of adre and tine along the chadian-sudanese border ,  the agencies said .  ninety-one children said they had been living with their family , consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent ,  the agencies said , adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing . the agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children , their youth and the situation in the region . other french charities earlier had questioned whether zoe 's ark could legally arrange adoption of children from darfur , and contacted french authorities , according to french newspapers and the associated press . french authorities have reacted angrily to the zoe 's ark trip , calling the group 's actions  illegal and irresponsible .  the french foreign ministry has said the dispute will not affect france 's participation in a european peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between chad and sudan . in response to the dispute in chad , the republic of congo said late wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions , the associated press reported . reporters without borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in chad . the organization said photographers marc garmirian of the capa news agency and jean-daniel guillou of the synchro x agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity 's efforts . the third journalist , marie-agnes peleran of the tv station france 3 miditerranee , was traveling with the group in a personal capacity , though she carried a camera from her station , reporters without borders said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's al goodman contributed to this report . copyright 2007 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten
