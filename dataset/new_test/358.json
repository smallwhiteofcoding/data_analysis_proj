{"text": "as the war in iraq reaches its five-year anniversary this week , two of the world 's leading humanitarian groups issued extensive reports monday describing a crisis of huge proportions with little reason for hope . iraqi women mourn the death of their relative outside the morgue in the restive city of baquba , iraq , on march 12 .  despite claims that the security situation has improved in recent months , the human rights situation is disastrous ,  amnesty international says in its report , titled  carnage and despair : iraq five years on .  in a summary of the report , amnesty writes that  a climate of impunity has prevailed , the economy is in tatters and the refugee crisis  keeps escalating . the international committee of the red cross , in a report titled  iraq : no let-up in the humanitarian crisis ,  writes ,  despite limited improvements in security in some areas , armed violence is still having a disastrous impact . civilians continue to be killed in the hostilities .  the injured often do not receive adequate medical care . millions of people have been forced to rely on insufficient supplies of poor-quality water as water and sewage systems suffer from a lack of maintenance and a shortage of engineers .  the bush administration and many republican lawmakers , including presidential candidate sen. john mccain , have frequently praised successes in iraq in recent months , noting improvements in security in key areas . they attribute that in part to the buildup of u.s. troops in iraq ordered by president bush last year . vice president dick cheney described the five year u.s.-led invasion of iraq in a news conference monday during a visit to baghdad .  this week marks the fifth anniversary ,  said cheney .  it has been a difficult , challenging , but none the less successful endeavor .  democrats , including presidential hopefuls hillary clinton and barack obama , have said the government failed to use the downturn in violence to achieve the steps it was supposed to make possible . sen. john mccain met with iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki on monday where he stressed the united states ' commitment to iraq .  we recognize that al qaeda is on the run , but they are not defeated . al qaeda continues to pose a great threat to the security and very existence of iraq as a democracy . so we know there 's still a lot more work that needs to be done ,  he said . amnesty writes ,  key political benchmarks have yet to be realized .  both amnesty and the red cross slam the iraqi government for failing to grapple with the critical needs of their populations . amnesty also says the iraqi government and the u.s.-led multi-national forces are responsible for some nightmarish circumstances .  civilians are also at risk from multi-national forces and iraqi security forces , with many killed by excessive force and tens of thousands detained without charge or trial ,  amnesty writes in its summary .  the death penalty was reintroduced in 2004 and hundreds of people have been sentenced to death . at least 33 people were executed in 2007 , many after unfair trials .  in its report , amnesty says the iraqi government  has failed to introduce practical measures to deal with the gross and serious human rights violations perpetrated by its security forces . there appears to be no serious willingness to investigate properly the many incidents of abuses , including killings of civilians , torture and rape , and to bring those responsible to justice .  the government has also been unable to reign in shiite militia groups , such as the mehdi army , or to rid the interior ministry of death squads . the fact that the government is divided along sectarian lines has serious repercussions on its effectiveness and bodes ill for the future .  the two reports cite a litany of concerns , including severe widespread poverty , a lack of food and water , and broken families left to scrounge for whatever they can find to get amnesty also says conditions for women have worsened with the rise of fundamentalist religious groups . many women  have been forced to wear islamic dress or targeted for abduction , rape or killing .  the group notes a study by the world health organization in 2006/2007 that found 21 percent of iraqi women had experienced physical violence . amnesty adds that the  predominantly kurdish region of northern iraq has been more stable with fewer acts of violence , and has seen growing economic prosperity and foreign investment . however , here too there continue to be serious human rights violations , including arrests for peaceful political dissent , torture , ill-treatment , the death penalty and the killing of women in so-called honor crimes .  the red cross says that despite the struggles in iraq , the organization  has been able to help hundreds of thousands of the neediest iraqis .  the group called for a  renewed effort  to  address the needs of everyday iraqis .
