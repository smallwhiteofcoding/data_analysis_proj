{"text": "washington republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination sunday to blistering criticism of the iraq war from former coalition commander retired lt. gen. ricardo sanchez . lawmakers lashed back at retired gen. ricardo sanchez on sunday after he criticized the war effort . on friday , sanchez , who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004 , called the iraq war  a nightmare with no end in sight .  he said the bush administration , the state department and congress all share blame . speaking with military reporters in virginia , sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial , but the politicians have not been held accountable .  i 'm astounded , really ,  south carolina republican sen. lindsey graham on cnn 's  late edition  with wolf blitzer on sunday . graham , who recently returned from baghdad , said he and gop presidential candidate sen. john mccain had visited sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004 .  every time we talked to gen. sanchez , we got pushback -- we have enough troops ; guard and reserves are n't being strained ,  graham said . he added that sanchez 's own record in iraq is blemished : abu ghraib  got out of control under his watch . the war in general got out of control under his watch .  but graham said that  finally ,  with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional u.s. troops since january ,  we are getting it right .  sanchez told reporters that american political leaders have cost american lives on the battlefield with their  lust for power .  sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty , but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired .  while the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power , our soldiers die ,  he said . that brought a tart response from mccain , the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee .  i wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time ,  mccain told cbs 's  face the nation .  he said sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but  unfortunately , that does n't happen very often .  one of the reasons few speak out , he said , is evidenced by what happened to former army chief of staff gen. eric shinseki , mccain said . shinseki was sidelined after telling congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy iraq . sen. mitch mcconnell , a republican from kentucky , told abc 's  this week  that sanchez is simply wrong .  my definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror ,  he said .  i think we 're making significant progress toward that end .  but , he added ,  i think the central government in iraq has been an embarrassment . they 've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for .  graham said he hopes the government of prime minister nuri al-maliki will  step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year .  if that does not happen , he said ,  it will be incumbent upon us , as a nation , to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable iraq .  that brought a blistering response from zbigniew brzezinski , national security adviser under president carter .  what is this ? this is a colony ,  he said .  that 's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter .  even those iraqis who were happy to see saddam hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing u.s. presence , brzezinski said . though some countries are willing to go along with the united states ,  no one in the world really supports our policy in iraq ,  he said . in his friday speech , sanchez added that the  surge  of u.s. troops into iraq represents  a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war .  national security council spokeswoman kate starr did not address the comment . instead , she said ,  we appreciate his service to the country . as gen. petraeus and ambassador crocker said , there 's more work to be done but progress is being made in iraq . and that 's what we 're focused on now .  gen. david petraeus is the u.s. top commander in iraq . ryan crocker is the u.s. ambassador to iraq . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
