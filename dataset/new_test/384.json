{"text": "washington president bush vetoed an expansion of the federally funded , state-run health insurance program for poor children for a second time wednesday , telling congress the bill  moves our country 's health care system in the wrong direction .  in his veto message , president bush calls on congress to extend funding for the current program . in his veto message , bush said the bill is almost a duplicate of the proposal he spiked in october .  because the congress has chosen to send me an essentially identical bill that has the same problems as the flawed bill i previously vetoed , i must veto this legislation , too ,  he said in a statement released by the white house . the bill would have expanded the state children 's health insurance program by nearly $ 35 billion over five years , the same as the measure bush vetoed october 3 . track recent and historical presidential vetoes  the president had proposed adding $ 5 billion to the program and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state-run program . democratic leaders said the new version addressed republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving schip benefits , capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program and preventing adults from receiving benefits . though the measure had strong bipartisan support , it fell short of the two-thirds majorities needed to override a presidential veto in the house and senate . house minority leader john boehner , r-ohio , said democrats were more interested in scoring political points with the veto than in reaching a compromise with republicans .  we could have resolved the differences in his program in 10 minutes , if the majority had wanted to resolve the differences ,  boehner said .  this has become a partisan political game .  the program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who ca n't afford private insurance . democrats wanted to extend the program to another 4 million , paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes .  what a sad day that the president would say that rather than insuring -lsb- millions of -rsb- children , ' i do n't want to raise the cigarette tax , '  said house speaker nancy pelosi . she called for a january 23 vote on whether to override the veto . meanwhile , bush called on congress to extend funding for the current program to keep the 6 million now covered on the rolls . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
