{"text": "german zookeepers in nuremberg will bottle-feed a four-week-old polar bear and rear it away from its mother after concerns the mother would eat her cub , officials said thursday . zookeepers fear the unnamed polar bear cub could be at risk of being eaten . the cub , which does n't yet have a name , was being cared for at nuremberg city zoo , where it was resting under heat lamps and is drinking formula .  it 's gaining weight , it 's very hungry , it drinks a lot of milk ,  said alexandra foghammar , a spokeswoman for the city . the zoo announced thursday that the cub is female . wednesday , the zoo said keepers decided to take the cub away from its mother , vera , because the mother was showing signs of being upset and confused , taking her baby in and out of the animals ' enclosure .  we were 100 percent sure that the baby was going to die if we did n't take it away from her ,  nuremberg zoo director dag encke told time magazine .  this would have been a death verdict for the cub .  the zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear , vilma , had eaten her two offspring . the zoo said it feared vera would do the same , so it took her cub away as a precaution . since then , the cub is thriving in the care of humans , but vera seems to miss her cub , foghammar said . watch how zoo has faced criticism over polar bears .   the mother is a little bit nervous ,  she said .  she walks around and is searching for the baby , but the responsible persons for the zoo say this is normal . it will continue for three or four days . it 's a normal situation .  the zookeepers are pondering whether to bring another adult bear , possibly the cub 's father , felix , to the zoo to help vera overcome her loss , and are seeking another small bear to serve as a companion for the rescued cub , time reported . the zoo said a keeper entered vilma 's enclosure monday and noticed that her two cubs were nowhere to be found . the zoo said it assumes vilma ate her young because she believed the cubs were sick , though zookeepers say the cubs were last seen on sunday and appeared in good health . but foghammar told time that the separation of the bears was bad for the  principle of wildlife conservation  at the zoo :  now the cub will not grow up to act in a natural way , just as the mother lacked the experience to bring up a cub .  the plight of the cub follows the case last year of knut , a cub rejected by its mother at berlin zoo who became the focus of a media frenzy after animal rights campaigners called for it to be killed , claiming it had become too dependent on humans . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
