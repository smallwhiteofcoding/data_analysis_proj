{"text": "before dying , 2-year-old riley ann sawyers was beaten with belts , picked up by her hair , thrown across the room and held under water , according to an affidavit from the galveston county sheriff 's office . police believe 2-year-old riley ann sawyers is  baby grace .  the affidavit says the girl 's mother , kimberly dawn trenor , described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box that trenor and her husband , royce zeigler , later dumped into a galveston waterway . trenor told police zeigler tried to commit suicide the weekend before thanksgiving , and wrote a note that said ,  my wife is innocent of the sins that i committed .  the body of the then-unidentified toddler was found on october 29 . a fisherman found riley 's body stuffed inside a blue storage container that washed up on an uninhabited island in galveston 's west bay . a medical examiner said the child 's skull was fractured , and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years . police dubbed the child  baby grace .  a police artist 's sketch of her was widely circulated in the news media and prompted a call to galveston police from riley 's grandmother in ohio , who had not seen the girl in months . on saturday , police arrested trenor and zeigler on charges of injuring a child and tampering with physical evidence , the sheriff 's department said . their bonds were set at $ 350,000 each . the affidavit , obtained by cnn , says when police interviewed trenor on november 23 , she  gave a voluntary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement , with royce zeigler , in the physical abuse , death and disposal of the remains of her daughter , riley ann sawyers .  trenor 's statement said on july 24 , she and zeigler both beat the child with leather belts and held her head under water in the bathtub . she said zeigler picked the girl up by her hair and also threw her across the room , slamming her head into the tile floor . after her daughter died , trenor 's statement said , she and zeigler went to a wal-mart that night and bought the sterilite container , a shovel , concrete mix , and other supplies . the statement said the box containing the child 's body was hidden in a storage shed for  one to two months .  then , trenor said , she and zeigler carried it to the galveston causeway and tossed it in , and she saw it drifting away . riley ann 's father , robert sawyers , on monday tearfully remembered her as a  fun-loving girl ... with a big imagination .  watch riley ann 's father describe the little girl  riley was  very active , very hyper , but also very well-behaved ,  sawyers told reporters in mentor , ohio . she would play  with a water hose ... spraying the whole patio soaking wet until she was done with it ,  he said , as he sat behind two photographs of his daughter , a toddler with wispy blond curls . robert sawyers ' mother , sheryl sawyers , said the family was  devastated  to learn that police believe riley is dead .  it 's hard to think that i 'll never see her again ,  she said , clutching a red elmo doll she had planned to give riley for christmas . maj. ray tuttoilmondo of the galveston county sheriff 's department said monday that authorities are  fairly confident  that the toddler whose body was found on october 29 is riley ann sawyers . dna analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification . the results will be available in two to three weeks , tuttoilmondo said . tuttoilmondo said riley is originally from mentor , ohio , a cleveland suburb , and that  she and her mother came down to texas earlier this year .  the toddler was last seen in texas  three or four months ago ,  tuttoilmondo said , although he did not know by whom . tuttoilmondo said police did investigate whether child protective services had taken riley away , something the mother had reportedly alleged . of that report , tuttoilmondo said ,  what we believe is that is not what happened .  the affidavit said trenor admitted that after the body was found , zeigler had her type up a fake letter from the ohio department of children 's services saying that riley was to be taken away . trenor left ohio in late may , after filing an allegation of domestic violence against robert sawyers and reaching a joint voluntary agreement that gave her custody of riley and gave robert sawyers visitation rights , the sawyers ' family lawyer said monday .  she disappeared ,  laura depledge said monday at the ohio news conference with the sawyers . sheryl sawyers said monday that she saw widely distributed police sketches of  baby grace  and contacted galveston police in november . the girl in the police sketches strongly resembles photos of riley .  no , i never did think it would end up like this ,  sheryl sawyers said monday , eyes welling .  i guess knowing is better than not knowing .  the girl 's family in ohio has been  very helpful  in this case , tuttoilmondo said , adding that the fbi and a galveston county police officer visited the family in ohio on sunday . depledge said riley was the product of a  teenage pregnancy .  trenor and robert sawyers were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy , depledge said , during which time they lived with sheryl sawyers . depledge said monday that the family , whose grief she described as  simply overwhelming ,  wants riley 's body returned to ohio for a memorial service .  what riley needs is to be brought home ,  she said .  i think this family needs some closure .  tuttoilmondo asked anyone who knew the child or her family to help detectives reconstruct the events of riley 's short life . the toddler 's case has touched even hardened police officers , he said .  any way you look at it , we carry a piece of her with us , and we 'll always carry a little piece of her with us ,  he said monday . he held up a small , pink-and-white shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was found .  that says it all . a little-bitty shoe .  e-mail to a friend . cnn 's sean callebs contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
