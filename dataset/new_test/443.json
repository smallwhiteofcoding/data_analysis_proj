{"text": "for two weeks in 1976 , nadia comaneci was probably the most recognizable person on the planet . comaneci scored seven perfect 10s in montreal in 1976 . just 14-years-old and standing less than five feet tall , the elfin romanian was the undisputed star of that year 's games in montreal after becoming the first gymnast in history to score a perfect 10 . comaneci finished up with three gold medals and -- just to prove that her initial effort had been no fluke -- seven perfect scores . her initial performance on the uneven parallel bars was greeted with uproar as the three-digit scoreboard , struggling to cope with what had been considered an unachievable feat , flashed up 1.00 . comaneci finished with four perfect 10s and the gold medal on the bars , but it was on the balance beam , one of gymnastics ' most dangerous disciplines , that comaneci truly dazzled . seemingly fearless , comaneci pirouetted and back-flipped her way to two more perfect 10s and her second gold . her final perfect score came in the floor routine as she also collected first place in the overall competition . comaneci 's transformation into an international celebrity -- she appeared on the front covers of time , newsweek and sports illustrated in the same week -- had been as unexpected as it was sudden . yet comaneci had been working towards the olympics ever since she had been picked out as a gymnast of rare talents as a six-year-old growing up in the industrial town of onesti . the reality of life as an olympic champion at home in nicolae ceausescu 's romania however , was not easy . constant surveillance comaneci was honored as a hero of socialist labor on her return home , yet the regime -- terrified that comaneci would defect after enjoying her taste of western celebrity -- kept its greatest star under constant surveillance . four years later , a very different comaneci returned to olympic competition in moscow . as an 18-year-old , she was four inches taller , 20 pounds heavier and suffering from sciatica -- a teenage starlet already starting to fade . still , comaneci was able to retain her gold medal on the balance beam , and collected another one in the floor exercises . but she was also involved in one of the bitterest incidents of the games when she was controversially beaten in the all-round competition by the soviet gymnast yelena davydova . it took the judges 28 minutes to decide the result and , ultimately , it was a lower score from the soviet judge -- perhaps reflecting the worsening relations between the soviet union and its formerly loyal satellite -- that denied comaneci her second straight gold in the event . comaneci retired in 1984 , traveling to los angeles that year as a team coach , yet she found it difficult to adjust to a life out of the spotlight . in 1989 , a few weeks before the collapse of the ceausescu regime , she defected to the united states , finally settling in norman , oklahoma to run a gymnastics school after marrying u.s. gymnastics star bart conner in 1996 . in 2000 comaneci was named as one of the athletes of the century by the laureus world sports academy . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
