{"text": "new york sen. charles schumer said sunday the bush administration is trying to  blame the fire on the person who calls 911  by suggesting he had a role in one of the costliest u.s. bank failures . sen. charles schumer said the ots  ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame .  federal regulators with the office of thrift supervision were  asleep at the switch  when it came to indymac 's  reckless  behavior , the new york democrat complained . the ots announced friday that it was taking over the $ 32 billion indymac and transferring control to the federal deposit insurance corporation . the ots pointed the finger directly at schumer for the failure , accusing him of sparking a bank run by releasing a letter that  expressed concerns about indymac 's viability .  watch what 's next for indymac   in the following 11 business days , depositors withdrew more than $ 1.3 billion from their accounts ,  the ots said in a statement announcing the california-based lender 's takeover on friday . the statement included a quote from ots director john reich saying ,  although this institution was already in distress , i am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process .  schumer , a member of the senate banking committee , chairman of congress ' joint economic committee and the third-ranking democrat in the senate , rejected any suggestions of responsibility for indymac 's collapse .  ots ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame and start doing its job to protect the future of the banking system , so that there wo n't be other indymacs ,  he said . schumer 's june 26 letter said he was  concerned that indymac 's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers .  in a sunday news conference , he said everything in his letter was already known to the public .  indymac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks ,  he said .  it was a spinoff from the old countrywide , and like countrywide , it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have . both indymac and countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we 're now in .  the embattled countrywide financial corp. was recently purchased by bank of america . schumer argued that the  breadth and depth  of the problems at indymac were  apparent for years , and they accelerated in the last six months .  but ots , he said ,  was asleep at the switch and allowed things to happen without restraint .  and now they are doing what the bush administration always does : blame the fire on the person who calls 911 .  the white house had no immediate response . schumer said ots is  known as a weak regulator ,  and added ,  my job was to try and toughen them up and that 's what i tried to do .  indymac , with assets of $ 32 billion and deposits of $ 19 billion , is the fifth bank to fail this year . between 2005 and 2007 , only three banks failed . and in the past 15 years , the fdic has taken over 127 banks with combined assets of $ 22 billion , according to fdic records . indymac will reopen monday with a new charter and a new name -- indymac federal bank .", "summary": "no summary"}
