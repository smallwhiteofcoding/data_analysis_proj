{"text": "in the words of vice president john nance garner , the vice presidency  is n't worth a pitcher of warm piss .  vice president aaron burr is best known for shooting and killing alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 . that may be true , but the characters who 've held the job are definitely worth a few good pages of trivia . join mental_floss in toasting seven backup plans that made this country great . 1 . chester arthur : james garfield 's v.p. chester arthur took office under the thickest cloud of suspicion . as a lieutenant in senator roscoe conkling 's political machine , arthur held one of the most lucrative positions in government : collector for the port of new york . for seven years , arthur raked in approximately $ 40,000 annually -lrb- about $ 700,000 today -rrb- , running a corrupt spoils system for thousands of payroll employees . with so much money and power , arthur developed an affinity for fancy clothes and earned the nickname  the gentleman boss .  but his luck did n't last . president rutherford hayes eventually stepped in and fired him from the post . even with the kickback scandal and claims that he 'd been born in canada -lrb- which should 've disqualified him for the vice presidency -rrb- , arthur still managed to get elected on james garfield 's 1880 ticket . after garfield passed away 199 days into his presidency , arthur did n't hesitate to sign the pendleton civil service reform act . much to the chagrin of conkling , the act revamped civil service by effectively killing the same patronage system that made arthur very , very rich . in cleaning up civil service , arthur also cleaned up his reputation , and he exited the white house a hero . 2 . henry wallace : franklin roosevelt 's second v.p. henry wallace was a dedicated devotee of eastern mysticism . while serving as u.s. secretary of agriculture in the 1930s , he allegedly sent his guru to mongolia under the pretense of collecting grasses that could withstand drought . in reality , wallace was diverting funds to help his guru hunt for evidence that christ had visited asia . but it was n't wallace 's spiritual beliefs that landed him america 's no. 2 job . wallace was a big franklin roosevelt fan and supported his entire platform , which is why roosevelt handpicked him as his third-term running mate in 1940 . wallace was n't popular with the democratic party , but when roosevelt made it clear he would n't run without him , the party acquiesced . as vice president , wallace made many international goodwill trips . most famously , he traveled to the soviet union , where he experienced a political transformation that resulted in him becoming an avowed soviet apologist . his communist leanings did nothing for his image , especially once he became secretary of commerce under president truman . in 1948 , wallace unsuccessfully ran for president on the progressive party ticket , espousing views that sounded shockingly marxist . he even described corporations as  midget hitlers  attempting to crush the labor class . but nobody can say wallace did n't know how to own up to his mistakes . in 1952 , he recanted his support of the soviet union in a magazine article called  where i was wrong .  by then , however , his political career was over . wallace spent the rest of his life conducting agricultural experiments on his farm in new york . 3 . william rufus de vane king : franklin pierce 's v.p. william r. king was sworn into office in cuba , becoming the only executive officer to take the oath on foreign soil . king had gone to cuba to recuperate from tuberculosis and severe alcoholism , but it did n't work . he died in 1853 after being vice president for just 25 days . that might not be the most memorable thing about king , though . it 's widely rumored that the former v.p. was homosexual . further still , he 's suspected of being james buchanan 's lover . neither king nor buchanan ever married , and they lived together in washington for 15 years before buchanan became president . of course , king 's predilection for wearing scarves and wigs only fanned the rumors . president andrew jackson used to call him  miss nancy ,  and aaron brown , a fellow southern democrat , dubbed him  aunt fancy .  4 . richard m. johnson : martin van buren 's v.p. despite his credentials as a war hero and a kentucky senator , vice president richard m. johnson was never accepted in washington . perhaps that 's because he dressed like a farmhand , cursed like a sailor , and made no secret of his three black mistresses , who were also his slaves . the first mistress bore him two daughters before she passed away ; the second tried to run off with a native american chief , but johnson captured and resold her ; and the third was the second one 's sister . johnson attempted to introduce this third mistress into polite society , but the couple was n't well-received . with the support of andrew jackson , johnson landed the vice presidency under martin van buren in 1836 . after four years of public relations disasters , jackson withdrew his support . nonetheless , van buren kept johnson on his ticket , and the two lost their re-election bid in 1840 . 5 . aaron burr : thomas jefferson 's v.p. no story on vice presidents would be complete without aaron burr -- best known for shooting and killing alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 . after the incident , burr went back to presiding over the senate . from there , he plotted a treasonous conspiracy to become emperor of the western united states and mexico . the plan could have worked , but one of burr 's co-conspirators ratted him out . he was tried in 1807 before the supreme court , which found him not guilty , mainly because he had n't actually committed the treason yet . a free man , burr turned his sights on florida . he went to france and tried to convince napoleon bonaparte to help him conquer the swampland , but that plan foundered , too . although his political high jinks often failed , burr consistently found success with the ladies . after his wife died in 1794 , burr remained a bachelor for 40 years , making the acquaintance of several eligible socialites . he enjoyed flirtations with philadelphia debutantes , as well as a widow named dolley payne todd -- later known as dolley madison , wife of james madison . at age 76 , burr married a wealthy widow of ill-repute and plundered her fortune . citing numerous infidelities on his part , she filed for divorce and was actually granted it . unfortunately for her , it came through on the day burr died . 6 . andrew johnson : abraham lincoln 's 4th v.p. andrew johnson took his 1865 vice-presidential oath drunk as a skunk and belligerent as hell . having grown up dirt poor , johnson felt the aristocracy in washington had abused his kinfolk . glassy-eyed and smelling of whiskey , he reminded congress , the supreme court , the cabinet , and pretty much everyone within hearing distance that they owed their positions to  plebeians  such as himself , then kissed the bible and staggered away . needless to say , his address was poorly received . the new york world opined ,  to think that one frail life stands between this insolent , clownish creature and the presidency ! may god bless and spare abraham lincoln !  unfortunately , god did n't . the south surrendered six days before lincoln 's assassination , leaving johnson to handle reconstruction -- a job he bungled so completely that congress moved to impeach him . incredibly , johnson avoided being booted out of office by just one vote . 7 . john cabell breckenridge : james buchanan 's v.p. by all accounts , john c. breckenridge was a kentucky gentleman in the grandest sense . he had an impressive career as a lawyer and a representative in the kentucky house . more notably , at age 36 , he became the youngest vice president in history . but , like aaron burr , things took a turn for breckenridge when he was charged with treason . in september 1861 , only a few months after his vice presidential term had ended , union and confederate forces invaded his home state of kentucky . breckenridge cast his lot with the confederates , and the federal government promptly indicted him . breckenridge headed south and became jefferson davis ' secretary of war . but when the confederacy surrendered in 1865 , breckenridge was forced to go on the lam . he hid for the next two months in georgia and florida before escaping to cuba . breckinridge , his wife , and their children spent the next four years in exile , wandering through canada , england , europe , and the middle east , until president andrew johnson issued a general amnesty proclamation on christmas in 1868 . the following march , breckenridge returned to the country with his family , but his name was n't officially cleared until 1958 , when a kentucky circuit court judge dismissed his indictment . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
