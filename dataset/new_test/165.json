{"text": "it all boils down to this . it does n't really matter all that much what hot , nubile french maverick has set the fashion world on fire . or which milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to angkor wat that 's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist . or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries . because , in the end , he 's ralph lauren , and we 're not . ralph lauren has his eye on china and japan . for four decades no other designer has had a greater impact , not only on the way american men and women dress but also on the way they imagine , seek and indulge in the good life , than the former tie salesman from the bronx .  those ties were handmade , by the way ,  recalls lauren .  back then , ties , even designer ones , did n't sell for more than $ 5 apiece . mine were $ 12 to $ 15 . such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary .  and ironic . because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony , lauren originally named his company polo because  it was the sport of kings . it was glamorous , sexy and international .  see his designs  in the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after marco polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of lauren 's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial . lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire , not just to be a success but to look like one before you 'd even achieved your goal . what 's more , lauren made it look as easy as fred astaire dancing down a staircase .  what matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible ,  says the designer .  when i look at the people i 've admired over the years , the ultimate stars , like frank sinatra , cary grant and astaire , the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency , whose naturalness is part of their excitement . and when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there , the ones you believe in and the ones you remember , like chanel and armani , are the ones that stand for something . fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality . and it 's an image that can change , that can evolve . it does n't reinvent itself every two years .  however , with a media that is insatiable for the new , the now and the next , being steadfast does n't always make for good copy .  the spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer ,  lauren admits .  and that 's fine . but the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else . we work real hard at that . it 's about getting your message out to the consumer . it 's about getting their trust , but also getting them excited , again and again . my clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- are n't concepts . they go into stores . our stores . thankfully , we have lots of them ,  says lauren .  what i rely on is people walking into my store saying , ' i want your clothes . '  well , if all of lauren 's customers shouted that together , he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers . lauren 's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet , on ski slopes and boats , at wimbledon and elsewhere . it furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables . it 's on the bed , in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables , thanks to the tome ralph lauren -lrb- rizzoli -rrb- , celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career . but far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his colorado-ranch sunset , the designer is going even more global .  americans have a real inferiority about their own style . we 've brought sportswear to the world , and yet we have a long way to go .  already in milan , london , paris and moscow , lauren has more stores planned for china , japan ... oh , everywhere .  there are n't enough americans out there ,  he says . who better to start with than ralph ? just as long as he does n't let on that most of us still ca n't play a lick of polo . e-mail to a friend . get a free trial issue of instyle - click here ! copyright Â© 2007 time inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
