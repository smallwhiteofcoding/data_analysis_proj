{"text": "some drivers would say that the united states is a crazy quilt of speed limits , with an emphasis on the  crazy .  a sign indicating the highest speed limit in the country stands by interstate 10 outside of the west texas town of el paso . since 1995 , states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits , leading to long debates on safety standards . to some folks , the speed limits are just insane -- either too low or too high , depending on their views about what makes driving safe . advocates of low speed limits wo n't find much to like about texas . true to its frontier roots , it stands out as the land of the fast getaway . the top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph , but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour , the highest speed limit on the country , on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner . this includes parts of interstate 10 between kerrville and el paso and of i-20 between monahans and the i-10 interchange . the speed limit for rural roads in montana is 75 mph . as a result , it takes just three hours to travel the 228 miles from billings to butte at the posted speed . but that 's much slower than a montana driver could have made the trip in early 1999 . at that time there was a six-month speeders ' honeymoon when the state had almost no control over rural speeds , partly as a result of an unfavorable court ruling . st. thomas in the u.s. virgin islands is at or near the other end of the spectrum . in the u.s. territory the speed limit is 20 mph in the city and 30 out in the country . when it comes to accident rates , though , you would be far better off on a montana interstate than competing with the island 's frenetic drivers on the way to paradise point . nationwide , maximum speeds range from 60 miles per hour in hawaii to 75 in most of the west . meanwhile , much of the eastern midwest and the northeast has opted for maximum speeds of 65 mph , although michigan and indiana chose the 70 mph standard more common to the south and the great plains states . so if you are cruising west along i-90 out of ohio , you can enjoy the increase in speed across 150 miles of indiana before illinois ' lower speed limit -- or its state police -- reins you in . as you continue west , interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in iowa , and then you can maintain a steady 75 from nebraska through to the california line , where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again . should you choose to detour into oregon , you 're back down to 65 . from a highway safety standpoint , the patchwork of speed limits at least seems to make sense . speeds are slower in more populous eastern states and faster in the wide-open west , although the insurance institute for highway safety argues that some of the new , higher speed limits out west and elsewhere are costing lives . it estimates that deaths on interstates and freeways have increased 15 percent due to the higher speed limits . but some researchers are skeptical about the link between accidents and high speeds on rural highways , if not on city streets and rural two-lanes . they point to the lower fatality rates on european highways , even though the speeds are generally higher . the maximum legal speed is roughly 80 mph in poland , austria , france and a few other countries . there is no speed limit on much of germany 's autobahn , although some sections are restricted to about 80 mph or less . ironically , the new regime of u.s. speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous . political scientist robert yowell , a professor at northeast lakeview college in texas , examined what happened after states began setting higher rural speed limits in 1995 . with the federal 65 mph limit gone , it was possible to compare the accident rates before and after the new limits went into effect . the results were clear :  by and large , across the 50 states , there was no discernible effect from the higher limits ,  yowell said .  two or three states actually had a decrease in fatalities .  once speed limits are raised on interstates , drivers are more likely to get off the more dangerous two lanes and use the faster routes , yowell said . furthermore , the motorists traveling the fastest on the higher-speed interstates tend to be good at that kind of driving . the less competent drivers at high speeds tend to drive more slowly . while yowell admits most states are well-intentioned , he 's  not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety ,  he said .  they are a function of revenue generation as well . there have been cases of judges saying communities have to raise their speed limits because they were obviously being used to raise revenues and that 's not a proper use of the law .  in part , yowell looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits .  it may be that certain states have a different approach to questions involving personal liberty versus collective safety ,  he said . his research does n't surprise jim baxter , president of the waunakee , wisconsin-based national motorists association . his organization had lobbied heavily for an end to the federal limits . baxter 's rule of thumb for computing the right speed limit is the traffic engineering standard known as the 85th percentile speed . that 's the speed that 85 percent of motorists drive at or below . but it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set . with the speed limit set at that level , traffic tends to move smoothly , reducing the risk of accidents , baxter said . if you put the limit below that speed , some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers , creating the most dangerous conditions of all . baxter argues that most drivers naturally tend to drive at speeds that suit the road conditions and their driving skills . st. thomas is a case in point , albeit an extreme one . with its congestion and rugged terrain , the island is bereft of performance cars ; many of the vehicles are older pickups , aging japanese compacts and suvs . the treacherous conditions restrict speeds far more effectively than any local law . as joe aubain , executive director of the st. thomas-st . john chamber of commerce , puts it ,  even if you wanted to go a whole lot faster , you could n't ,  he said . e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
