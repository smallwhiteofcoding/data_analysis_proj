{"text": "editor 's note : saturday marks one year since hamas ' defeat of fatah in the fierce struggle for control of gaza . cnn correspondent ben wedeman has been covering the region for over 15 years . he reports from gaza on daily life and reality over the past year in this fractious land . cnn 's ben wedeman reports on the past year in gaza , where people are safer but out of food , gas , and patience . gaza city , gaza  if you take pictures , i 'll kill you ! i 'll kill you !  screamed a masked fatah gunman , pointing his ak-47 assault rifle at my cameraman , joe duran .  calm down ! calm down !  i shouted back at him , turning to joe to tell him to put the camera down . joe and i had ducked into a fruit and vegetable shop in gaza city . we had been covering the funeral of a fatah gunman killed in a clash with hamas rivals when our third gunbattle of the day had broken out . the gunman left , much to everyone 's relief , and i put my small video camera on the floor and pressed the button to record the constant roar of machine gun fire , which went on for more than half an hour . earlier in the day , joe and i were on a street corner videotaping hamas militiamen when a jeep full of fatah irregulars opened fire , just down the street from an elementary school . as guns blazed , schoolchildren ran for cover . i watched as shopkeeper khadar aliyan slammed shut the doors of his grocery store , the expression on his face one of fear and utter exasperation .  i 'm going home ,  he told me .  i 'm afraid . we 're done for . it 's never been this bad .  it was violence like this , which we witnessed on december 2006 , that reached a climax in the second week of june 2007 . when it ended on june 14 , 2007 , with hamas roundly defeating fatah , gaza went quiet . and quiet -- relative quiet , that is -- has been hamas ' biggest accomplishment since . no longer do you worry about being kidnapped . gunbattles , though they can happen , are much less common . after last june 's takeover -lrb- or coup d'etat , as fatah supporters call it -rrb- , hamas quickly imposed law and order , tried to reacquaint gaza 's drivers with long-forgotten traffic regulations , launched a municipal cleanup campaign , and forced the release of kidnapped bbc journalist alan johnston , who had been held in captivity for almost six months . chaos-weary gazans applauded all of these initiatives . but the honeymoon ended quickly as reality sank in . since hamas won parliamentary elections in january 2006 , and even more so since last year 's takeover , israel has tightened its siege of gaza . israel has restricted supplies of gasoline , diesel and electricity to gaza , limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip , and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in gaza to export anything to the outside world . israeli officials say these measures are intended to pressure hamas , which is on the u.s. government list of terrorist groups , to stop its members and other factions from firing mortars and rockets into israel . israel defense forces reports that 1,500 qassam rockets were fired into israel from gaza in 2007 , and 2,383 in the past six years . as a result , almost all of gaza 's factories have shut down and thousands of workers have lost their jobs . between 70 and 80 percent of the population is dependent on food supplied by the united nations refugee works agency , set up after more than 700,000 palestinians became refugees after the war that resulted in israel 's creation in 1948 . life in gaza , never easy , in the last year has become a grinding daily struggle to make ends meet . for the vast majority of gazans , it means they must spend much of their time trying to secure basic commodities . such as cooking gas , which comes from israel . in the past , when supplies were plentiful , it was sold from the back of trucks and donkey carts . not anymore . when there are supplies , people flock to a few distribution centers . one is a hot , crowded compound north of gaza city , where the stench of gas is so strong you shudder with fear that someone will light a cigarette and the whole place will go up in flames . people have to wait for their cooking gas for hours some claim days , in the hot sun . there i met a woman who identified herself as um wadi'a -lrb- the mother of wadi'a -rrb- , who at 2 p.m. told me she had been waiting since 5 a.m. . she said she had run out of cooking gas three days before . typical of so many people here , she blamed both main palestinian factions for her woes .  hamas has n't done anything for us , nor has fatah ,  she said .  all those people want is to sit comfortably on their thrones .  in gaza city , long lines of immobile cars and trucks wind around the block from gas stations , their owners waiting , surprisingly patiently , for supplies to arrive . the only other option is to go in search of black market gasoline , much of it smuggled through tunnels from egypt . it goes for more than $ 10 a liter , which comes close to almost $ 50 a gallon . it is now common for families to divide up responsibilities for the day . one family member will go in search of cooking gas , another will join the line for gasoline or diesel , another for whatever else is in short supply . to get around the shortages , some motorists mix their fuel with cooking oil , a practice that is n't particularly good for the motor . many people complain that it 's unhealthy -- but it works . others , like electrical engineer wasim khazandar , are thinking completely outside the box . wasim has invented an electric car , which he is more than happy to show off . he 's already received dozens of orders from motorists weary of the search for fuel . beyond material concerns , there are worries here that hamas has a barely concealed hardline islamist agenda , and one often hears complaints that the group is intolerant of any form of dissent or criticism . one man who can testify to that is ibrahim abu al-naja , the most senior fatah leader to remain in gaza after most fled to safety in ramallah . abu al-naja is from the fatah old school , a grizzled veteran of the group 's wars in lebanon . he told me earlier this year hamas security officials showed up at his home late at night , bound his hands , put a blindfold on him and dragged him to their headquarters , where they shaved his head and cut off his moustache , then released him without apology or explanation . he makes no excuses for fatah 's dismal track record of corruption and mismanagement when it ran gaza , but says the crisis that began with hamas ' rise to power is nothing short of a catastrophe .  our people has been transformed ,  he said ,  into a desperate people , who must search for food , for the minimum of survival . it 's as if we returned to 1948 , dependent on gifts and assistance and relief .  despite all the difficulties of life under hamas , despite all the grumbling , the men who run gaza are as confident today as they were a year ago that they will weather the crisis and emerge stronger . last wednesday i went to see ahmed yusif , a senior adviser to hamas prime minister ismail haniya .  whatever the israelis think ,  said the u.s.-educated yusif ,  whatever pressure they put on us , it 's not going to make us buckle or give concessions .  this is part of the palestinian struggle for more than 60 years living in the refugee camps ,  he said .  we do n't always enjoy a good life . it 's the toughness and the suffering -lsb- that -rsb- are part of the struggle .  others here do n't quite see it that way , like a man i met in gaza 's old market who would only identify himself as abu khalid . i asked him if he was better off today than a year ago . he laughed , cursed israel , hamas , fatah , the united states , the european union and the rest of the world , then made the following suggestion :  let them open a market in gaza so we can sell some of our children -lsb- in order to -rsb- feed the rest .
