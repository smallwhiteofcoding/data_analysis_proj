{"text": "phnom penh , cambodia cambodia has sent a letter to the united nations security council to call attention to its continuing standoff with thailand over an ancient border temple on disputed land . cambodian soldiers stand guard near preah vihear temple , close to the thai border . the country is not asking for u.n. intervention , said information minister kheu kanharith . rather , the letter that cambodia 's permanent mission in new york submitted to the chairmen of the security council and the general assembly is meant to draw attention to a crisis that entered its sixth day sunday . the two countries agreed to meet monday to defuse tensions -- even as each side continued to amass more troops to the site of the preah vihear temple . both cambodia and thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple , which sits atop a cliff on cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the thai side . the international court of justice awarded the temple to cambodia in 1962 . thailand claims , however , that the 1.8 square mile -lrb- 4.6 sq. km -rrb- area around it was never fully demarcated . thailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the cambodian government used a map drawn during the french occupation of cambodia that places both the temple and the surrounding area in that country 's territory . earlier this month , the united nations approved cambodia 's application to have the temple listed as a world heritage site -- places the u.n. says have outstanding universal value . the decision re-ignited tensions , with some in thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple . opposition parties in thailand used the issue to attack the government , which initially backed the heritage listing . a thai court overturned the pact , prompting the resignation of thailand 's foreign minister , noppadon pattama . he had endorsed the application . cambodia , meanwhile , is preparing for general elections on july 27 . and prime minister hun sen , who has been in power since the mid-1980s , has portrayed the u.n. recognition as a national triumph . the current flare-up began tuesday , when cambodian guards briefly detained three thais who crossed into the area . once they were let go , the three refused to leave the territory . cambodia claims thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers . thailand denies the charge , saying its troops are deployed in thai territory . each side has asked its troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon . so far , the only casualty has been a thai soldier who was injured tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the khmer rouge occupied the area . the khmer rouge , a radical communist movement that ruled cambodia from 1975 to 1979 , won power through a guerrilla war . it is remembered for the deaths of as many as 1.5 million cambodians . -- journalist soeum yin contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
