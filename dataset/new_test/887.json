{"text": "sen. john mccain 's campaign rebuked sen. joe biden on tuesday , saying the democratic vice presidential nominee had  sunk to a new low  by raising a debate over who cares more for special needs children . sen. joseph biden embraces a supporter during a campaign stop in columbia , missouri , on tuesday . the republican camp 's sharp response came after biden said gop advocates for children with birth defects should support stem cell research . during a campaign event in columbia , missouri , biden did not mention his republican counterpart by name but said ,  i hear all this talk about how the republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy ... and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability , who were born with a birth defect .  biden 's support of stem cell research is at odds with the position taken by the republicans ' vice presidential nominee , alaska gov. sarah palin , whose 5-month-old son , trig , has down syndrome . palin , an evangelical christian , opposes stem cell research because it involves the use of human embryos , but her running mate , gop presidential nominee mccain , does support stem cell research .  well , guess what , folks ? if you care about it , why do n't you support stem cell research ?  asked biden , the running mate of democratic presidential nominee sen. barack obama . those comments brought a sharp response .  barack obama 's running mate sunk to a new low today , launching an offensive debate over who cares more about special needs children ,  mccain-palin spokesman ben porritt said .  playing politics with this issue is disturbing and indicative of a desperate campaign .  biden spokesman david wade insisted that the delaware senator 's comments were not directed at palin .  this is a clash of policies , not a clash of personalities ,  wade said .  we 've heard not a dime 's worth of difference between the mccain-palin ticket and the bush administration on medical breakthroughs that millions of parents and doctors believe could save lives and transform the quality of life for countless americans .  during her acceptance speech at the republican national convention last week , palin told parents of children with disabilities that she would be  a friend and advocate in the white house .  but the alaska governor 's support for the disabled has come under scrutiny since mccain chose palin to be his running mate nearly two weeks ago . before her run for the vice presidency , advocacy for special needs programs had not been a central part of her political campaigns or during her administration , despite her sister 's autistic son . watch more on palin 's budget priorities  palin signed a bill this year increasing special needs funding but frustrated some of the bill 's co-sponsors by stepping in only at the last minute . sonya kerr , an anchorage attorney specializing in disability rights , filed a lawsuit against the state and palin , alleging that there are not enough services for kids with special needs , specifically a child with autism .  i would say , welcome , gov. palin , to our reality and what we 've been trying to deal with for a long time ,  kerr said .  i hope that it means that there will be support on a bipartisan basis for what people with disabilities need so we are not a bargaining chip in the political process .  cnn 's deb feyerick , alexander mooney and rachel streitfeld contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
