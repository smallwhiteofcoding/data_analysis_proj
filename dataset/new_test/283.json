{"text": "the death of a passenger last week aboard an american airlines flight underscores the importance of taking precautions before flying , a travel health industry representative said monday . an american airlines passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week . jill drake , a marketing representative for medaire , inc. , said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17,000 in-flight medical events . flight attendants with sick passengers call good samaritan hospital in phoenix , arizona , a level-one trauma center where emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions from any of 2 million airline passengers flying at any given time , she said .  very rarely  does the call result in a diversion , a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passenger 's health , she said . the pilot must weigh weather conditions , remaining fuel and proximity to an airport . as of 1 p.m. -lrb- 3 p.m. et -rrb- monday , medaire had fielded 110 calls ,  which is a very busy day for us ,  she said . on average , the company gets about 50 in-flight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day , and an additional 25 or 30 calls related to events that occur at airport gates or aboard yachts and commercial ships , she said . airlines contracting with medaire include continental , southwest and british airways . american has its own in-house medical team . drake said medaire 's doctors documented 97 onboard deaths in 2007 , down from 110 in 2006 . the top categories of in-flight illness are fainting , gastrointestinal problems , respiratory issues such as shortness of breath , heart problems ranging from arrhythmias to arrest and orthopedic problems , such as broken bones , drake said . by law , u.s.-based commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators , oxygen and medical kits . some airlines choose to carry extra , non-mandated medications . if a passenger already has breathing problems , airplane travel will only worsen the condition because cabins are typically pressurized at 8,000 feet , said drake . her advice to anyone not feeling 100 percent :  do not travel .  and anyone with a medical condition who travels should pack any critical medications in a carry-on bag , she said . though flight attendants are trained to handle on-board emergencies ,  they are not medically trained ,  she said .  to think that they are going to be able to assist your every need , that 's quite a high expectation .  hydration and moderation are key , and passengers should carry water and a snack , she said . vacationers often return home from tropical locales sunburned and , in some cases , drunk .  altitude amplifies the buzz ,  drake said .  you have a couple of cocktails in denver , you feel it a little bit more than in omaha .  denver 's altitude is 5,280 feet ; omaha 's is 1,040 feet . flying in a fresh cast can also prove dangerous .  your arm could expand and it could cut off your circulation ,  she said , noting that the risk is reduced with older casts , which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling . though the faa began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago , the list was tiny . during the 1990s , overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment , and pressure increased for u.s.-based airlines to follow , said dr. russell rayman , executive director of the aerospace medical association , which has roughly 3,000 members including physicians , research scientists and flight nurses . congress held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004 . american airlines was among the first to do so , said dr. david mckenas , who served for 10 years as the airline 's corporate medical director until 2002 . he lauded the defibrillator as  so good it 's like 100 cardiologists in a box .  the machine will only work if the patient 's heart is fibrillating , a condition where the contractions become so irregular it loses its ability to pump blood efficiently . american airlines buys its kits from banyan international corp. , which describes itself as  the nation 's leading provider of emergency medical kits .  each of the nine-pound , $ 250 kits includes aspirin , alcohol swabs , nitroglycerine tablets , antihistamines , iv tubing , a stethoscope , a blood-pressure gauge , a bronchodilator , syringes , gloves , saline solution , epinephrine , dextrose , a manual resuscitation bag , alcohol pads and shears . oxygen comes in several forms aboard planes . the oxygen that flows into masks stored above individual seats is not medical oxygen and would not suffice for a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency , said rayman . flight attendants have portable bottles of oxygen that they are to use for themselves in the event of a cabin decompression .  it could be used if there is a medical emergency on board , but that 's not its purpose ,  he said . more oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots . though medaire keeps track of its clients ' medical air incidents , rayman criticized the faa 's failure to do so .  there is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved ,  he said .  they do n't want to report it because it just does n't look good . it 's not good p.r. , you could say .  he said even an anonymous registry would serve a useful purpose .  we 're concerned for safety on the flight ,  faa spokeswoman alison duquette said .  once someone leaves the aviation system , there is no way for us to track the outcome .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
