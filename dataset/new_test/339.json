{"text": "london , england -- football will pay its tribute to the legend of manchester united 's busby babes on wednesday in moments of remembrance on the 50th anniversary of the munich air disaster . a memorial stone recalls the place of the munich air disaster in kirchtrudering near munich . eight players lost their lives on february 6 , 1958 , when flight 609 zu crashed on the third attempt to take off after re-fuelling in germany as united returned from knocking red star belgrade out of the european cup . sir matt busby 's side , back-to-back english champions and well positioned for a hat-trick attempt , were arguably on course to become the best united team . the united players killed at munich were geoff bent , aged 25 , roger byrne -lrb- 28 -rrb- , eddie colman -lrb- 21 -rrb- , mark jones -lrb- 24 -rrb- , david pegg -lrb- 22 -rrb- , tommy taylor -lrb- 26 -rrb- , liam whelan -lrb- 22 -rrb- and 21-year-old duncan edwards who died in hospital 15 days after the crash . they and the other 15 people who lost their lives will be remembered with a commemorative service at old trafford while a short ceremony , organised by supporters , will also take place at the memorial site in kirchtrudering , on the outskirts of munich . in keeping with tradition , united supporters will also gather under the memorial plaque at old trafford where the clock is fixed at the exact time of the final fateful take-off attempt . later in the day , a minute 's silence will take place ahead of england 's friendly with switzerland at wembley as a further mark of respect . as he bows his head during this week 's munich commemorations , survivor harry gregg 's mind will understandably flash back to that snow-laden runway , but only briefly . the 75-year-old ulsterman prefers not to remember the afternoon he lost so many friends among the victims , but instead the days when the dream of the ` busby babes ' was still vibrant and alive . goalkeeper gregg , hailed a hero in the wake of the crash after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors , is adamant those are the times which always burn brightest in his memory .  i was part of something that was a very , very beautiful thing at that time ,  said gregg , who cost united a record 23,000 pounds sterling when he joined from doncaster rovers two months before the disaster .  i 'll always be proud of that . the fact there 's going to be a minute 's silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people i played with , but one must remember as well there were other people on board that aircraft , a lot more people .  i want the minute 's silence to be over and then i want to remember the happy times , that 's what i want the world to remember , that 's what i want the families to remember .  e-mail to a friend .", "summary": "no summary"}
