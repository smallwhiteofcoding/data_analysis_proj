{"text": "macau , china -- pete sampras rolled back the years to upset current world number one roger federer in an exhibition match in macau on saturday . sampras enjoyed the spoils of victory in macau after two previous defeats to federer . federer had one the two previous clashes in an asian series in straight sets but was handed a 7-6 6-4 defeat in the finale . american ace sampras downplayed his victory , noting federer was coming off a long season and that he was helped by his big serve and the fast indoor carpet surface . he had only aimed to win one set during the three-match series .  let 's not get carried away ,  he said at a news conference . sampras ruled out a comeback from retirement , telling the audience after the match ,  i had my time in the 90s .  federer tried to put on a positive spin on the loss , saying he was n't embarrassed to lose to his idol , but still showed some disappointment .  it 's been tough beating my idol the last two times . i 'm happy that he got me at least once ,  he said , but adding ,  i hope we can do it again in the future . i 'd like to get him back .  the two players have won a combined 26 grand slam titles , but sampras , 36 , retired five years ago after winning the u.s. open in 2002 . federer is coming off another outstanding season in which he won three grand slams and last week 's masters cup in shanghai .  i 'm sort of surprised . this guy can play tennis , you know ,  the swiss player said after his loss saturday . federer beat sampras 6-4 6-3 in seoul on tuesday and edged the american 7-6 7-6 in kuala lumpur on thursday . in macau , federer was never able able to force a break point on the powerful sampras serve , but had set points at 6-5 and 8-7 in the tiebreak . but sampras saved both and a run of three points , capped by a forehand winner , gave him the opener . the ninth game of the second second proved vital as a forehand error by federer gave sampras a break point which he gratefully took with another fine forehand . sampras closed out the match as a federer backhand return sailed long . federer said he thought sampras could still beat the world 's top five players on a fast surface . sampras then predicted that federer could beat his record of most grand slam wins -lrb- 14 -rrb-  if not next year , pretty soon .   he 's a great , great player . he 's got things in his game that i could n't do ,  he said . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .", "summary": "no summary"}
