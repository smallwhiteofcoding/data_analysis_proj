{"text": "it takes a truly adventurous actress to pull off a razored mohawk , a platinum pixie and a louise brooks bob , but we 'd expect nothing less from the ever provocative selma blair , who experimented with all three looks in under a year . selma blair says she works with hairstylists and makeup artists who  have a vision .   i have no fears when it comes to my hair or clothes ,  proclaims the 36-year-old star of nbc 's upcoming mom-and-daughter sitcom  kath and kim  and july 's action flick  hellboy ii : the golden army .  makeup , however , is an entirely different matter for the self-declared  poor applier ,  who sticks with basics like nude lipstick and pink blush , and ducks whenever she sees a liquid liner .  i avoid anything difficult ,  she says . blair 's signature look :  a rosy cheek , a smudgy eye , a lot of mascara -- i look like a doll that has too much makeup on , and i love it !  have you always been a beauty chameleon ? in high school i would mess with my hair and makeup all the time . i used to wear a shirt that said  ms. clairol  because i changed my hair color so much . i was blond for a long time , then what my mom called  barnyard red .  do you still dye it yourself ? only when i have to cover up stray grays . and i 'll just use whatever color i find in the grocery store that looks good on the box , like preference by l'oréal -- because i 'm worth it -lsb- laughs -rsb- . but for my platinum hair , i went to sheri at román salon in l.a. . she was a saint . i had just dyed my hair dark brown , so she had to very slowly strip out all the color so that my hair would n't burn off . and the cut -- are you keeping it short ? i tend to like my hair whatever way it 's not , so now i miss it being long . i think i 'm more approachable with long hair . when it 's short , i come across as being artsy and weird . what 's your typical makeup look ? i used to wear a lot of red lipstick , and when i got a pimple , i 'd cover it up with eyeliner to turn it into a beauty mark . but everything has changed since i hit 35 . i 'm at an age where any makeup that 's meant to look  slept in  really looks like i slept in it . that 's for youngsters ! now less is more . i do n't like to wear concealer or anything . i 'd rather have uneven skin than feel like my face is cracking from too much foundation . then you must be serious about your skin care . i go to a spa in l.a. called kinara for its skin care bootcamp . you go once a week for 12 sessions and they 'll look at your skin and tell you how to get it in better condition . they really helped me a lot . i also stay out of the sun . any thoughts on botox or plastic surgery ? i wanted to get botox once to make me feel younger . but i do n't really have -lsb- enough wrinkles -rsb- to justify it yet . as for going under the knife , i ca n't say i would n't , but i have n't thought too much about it . best beauty product ? egyptian magic cream is my saving grace for everything . it works for my friend 's baby 's bottom , and i can also use it instead of chapstick . so what 's next ? i 'm really excited about having a perma-tan and wearing long highlighted hair extensions for my role on  kath and kim .  and i 've been gaining weight for the part by eating a little bit more of what i want and not moving around as much . i 've already put on 15 pounds , and i 'll probably gain another 10 . it 'll be a whole new me ! will this be your most drastic transformation ? actually i wore huge prosthetic boobs for a john waters movie . they were glued on every day by a really handsome guy , but ripping them off every night was definitely outside my realm of comfort . after those bosoms , i did n't mind being flat-chested anymore ! get a free trial issue of instyle - click here ! copyright © 2008 time inc. . all rights reserved .", "summary": "no summary"}
