' overlooked : paula stevenson told an inquest her one-year-old daughter was neglected at the hospital . the coroner heard from a succession of doctors and nurses who said hayley 's rapid deterioration had come as a shock to them . mrs stevenson has told the inquest she begged nurses to move hayley into intensive care , but was repeatedly assured this was unnecessary . at one point , she even tried ` bribing ' a nurse with # 100 to pay more attention to hayley , who was born in northern ireland . mrs stevenson told coroner aidan cotter : ` i could not believe that hayley had just been left to deteriorate . all along the family had expressed their concerns about hayley 's breathing and had even asked if there was a problem with her lungs , yet nothing was done . ` all she did was sleep . i missed my little girl so much and i felt as though i had n't seen her eyes in so long , her big blue eyes . ' hayley was born with a hole in her heart and was recovering from surgery when complications arose . describing the awful moments as her daughter 's life ebbed away , she said : ` i saw that hayley was really gasping for breath . ` her eyes were panic-stricken and they started rolling back in her head . ` hayley looked awful , she was like a fish out of water . she was gasping and gasping for every breath . ' paula stevenson , seen here with a picture of her baby girl hayley , says the staff at birmingham children 's hospital failed ` abominably ' mrs stevenson said there were around 15 people in the room working to save her daughter . she said : ` all the time i was stroking her head and telling her she was the best wee girl in the world . ` they worked on her until their hands hurt . all i could see was the monitor flashing -lsb- cardiac -rsb- arrest . ` all the time i kept squeezing her hand gently just to see if she would squeeze it back . hayley never squeezed my hand back . it was cold and lifeless . ` after 19 minutes everyone had stopped looking at hayley and they were now all looking at me with pity in their eyes . ` at 20 minutes -lsb- a doctor -rsb- confirmed my worst fears . he said , `` sorry mum , we 've lost her . '' ` and all i could think about was that i was no longer a mummy because hayley was my only child and she was dead . i was in shock and utterly devastated . ` the treatment has led me to question how can the staff at birmingham children 's hospital fail hayley so abominably ?

' mr miliband proposed new measures to prevent britons being ` locked out ' of jobs by foreign workers , including forcing firms to declare if they employ high numbers of immigrants . labour would ban employment agencies that only use foreign workers and job centres would have to be informed of firms employing more than one in four staff from overseas . mr miliband distanced himself from the rhetoric of his predecessor gordon brown , saying : ` i am not going to promise `` british jobs for british workers '' . ' he also said worrying about immigration ` does not make people bigots , not in any way ' , a reference to mr brown 's rebuke , during the 2010 general election , of pensioner gillian duffy , who he dismissed as a ` bigoted woman ' after she raised concerns with him about immigration . changes : mr miliband proposed new measures to prevent britons being ` locked out ' of jobs by foreign workers , including forcing firms to declare if they employ high numbers of immigrants . in a reference to the last labour government , mr miliband added : ` we too easily assumed those who worried about immigration were stuck in the past , unrealistic about how things could be different , even prejudiced . ` but britain was experiencing the largest peacetime migration in recent history , and people 's concerns were genuine . to those who lost out , labour was too quick to say `` like it or lump it '' . ' sir andrew green , of migrationwatch , said : ` what was missing from his speech was an appreciation of the scale immigration has reached . it 's running at 250,000 a year . that is going to add millions to our population in 15 years . ' immigration minister damian green said : ` until ed miliband supports the government 's measures to cut and control immigration , labour will have no credibility . under his leadership , labour have opposed our aim to get annual net migration down to the tens of thousands , and they have opposed the cap on economic migration , our changes to student visas and our reforms to family visas .

' in fact , slough is bordered on three sides by south buckinghamshire district council , which pays its councillors a basic # 4,100 a year . of the 12 which raised allowances above inflation , five councils also increased council tax . the tpa pointed to major differences between the allowances in neighbouring authorities , and questioned why manchester pays # 16,000 while next door trafford pays less than # 6,500 . of large metropolitan authorities , birmingham pays # 16,267 -- almost # 10,000 more than trafford . tpa chief executive matthew sinclair said : ` with local authorities up and down the country having to rein in spending , councillors who have awarded themselves an increase in their allowances in defiance of government advice should hang their heads in shame . ` they can not retain the moral authority to make tough decisions on spending . ' mr neill said : ` most councils have frozen or cut councillor allowances to do their bit . ` however , a small minority have hiked them which is completely unjustifiable given rank-and-file workers in local government have faced a pay freeze . these councils should be held to account .

' i believe my religion requires me to wear a beard . ' the beard : maj nidal hasan is seen left , before the 2009 shooting that killed 13 at the fort hood , texas base with him seen more recently , right , while refusing to shave on reasons of his religious faith . hasan said his beard was not a show of disrespect to the court . the pretrial hearing was the first since a military appeals court stopped proceedings aug. 15 to consider the dispute over hasan 's beard less than a week before his court-martial was to begin . gross held hasan in contempt of court and fined him $ 1,000 for a sixth time on thursday , and again sent him to a nearby room to watch the rest of the proceedings on closed-circuit television . ' i am not trying to disrespect your authority as a judge , ' hasan said before his latest removal from the courtroom . ` when i stand before god , i am individually responsible for my actions , ' he said , apparently referring to the beard . hasan faces the death penalty if convicted in the november 2009 attack that killed 13 and wounded more than two dozen others on the texas army post . gross , who has said he would order hasan to be forcibly shaved before the trial if he did not get rid of the beard himself , said thursday that he will order a forcible shaving next week . that will delay the case again because hasan 's attorneys can appeal before a decision is made on whether he 'll be forcibly shaved , gross said . contempt of court : hasan , seen after charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder , is held in contempt of court for his beard which could be forcibly shaved . earlier this week , the u.s. court of appeals for the armed forces ruled that hasan 's appeal was premature because gross has not issued a definitive order for hasan to be forcibly shaved . the court said that if gross issues that order , he must address several issues , including whether the religious freedom restoration act applies in the court-martial . some witnesses for prosecutors and defense attorneys may testify at another pretrial hearing at fort hood next week to address those issues . hasan 's attorneys have argued that forcing him to shave would violate his religious freedoms . they also have said hasan would n't shave because he had a premonition that his death is imminent , and does n't want to die beardless because he believes not having one is a sin . according to military regulations , soldiers who disobey orders to be clean-shaven can be forcibly shaved . gross has said he wants hasan in the courtroom during the court-martial to prevent a possible appeal over the beard if hasan is convicted . hasan is paralyzed from the waist down after being shot by police on the day of the rampage , but appears to have full use of his arms . prosecutors have said they do n't believe that religion is hasan 's motive , noting he was clean-shaven at the time of the shootings .	 maj nidal hasan fined six times for the beard that violates army regulations .   hasan told a judge on thursday the beard is required by his muslim faith .   according to military regulations his beard could be forcibly cut .

' dr robinson , who published his book telling the story of the tranby and others in 2011 , said he was amazed when a few months later he was contacted from australia . he said : ` when i saw the two oak trees at tranby house i realised they came from the acorns taken over with the settlers , i jokingly said `` could you send some acorns over ? '' and they did . ` we planted the seeds in the botanical gardens at the university but then we thought how fitting it would be if they returned to the spot where they came from .

' i see risks here for both sides , ' koh said . the lavish event was attended by a host of olympic stars , including victoria pendleton and laura trott . attorneys for both companies told koh they would pass along the message . samsung continued presenting witnesses on wednesday , including an industrial designer from south korea who described developing the galaxy line of tablets . speaking through a korean interpreter , jin soo kim said he began working on a tablet in october 2009 , months before apple launched the ipad in january 2010 . kim recounted the rationale behind different design choices for the galaxy tab 10.1 . the screen , for instance , was set at 10.1 inches both to maximize its size and contain manufacturing costs . ' i really enjoy what i do as a designer , ' kim said . ' i am proud of what i do . ' asked by samsung attorney john quinn whether he copied the designs of any other company , kim said : ' i have not . ' apple attorney harold mcelhinny showed kim internal samsung emails , referring to a meeting between samsung and google executives . at the meeting , google told samsung executives they should redesign its early tablet because it too closely resembled apple 's ipad , according to the february 2010 emails . google created the android operating system , which runs on the samsung phones and tablets at issue in the lawsuit . kim said he did not attend the google meeting and was not briefed about it by his colleagues . the nine-member jury is scheduled to begin deliberations next week .	 despite ongoing dispute , samsung launches new tablet with lavish party featuring kylie minogue and team gb athletes .   jury deliberations set to begin next week in what could be biggest ever patent dispute .

' the group obtained observations from nasa 's spitzer space telescope , which monitors infrared radiation emitted by objects in the solar system and beyond . demory and his colleagues trained the telescope on 55 cancri , observing the star during a six-hour window during which the tiny exoplanet passed behind it -- a phenomenon known as an occultation . demory measured the starlight before and after the planet 's occultation , discovering a minute dip when the star completely eclipsed the planet . to make sure the dip was n't merely a fluke , the team obtained three more sets of data for the same orbital window , and analyzed all four datasets together . ` when you stack all the data together , you see a beautiful dimming light that clearly shows the light from the planet that disappears , ' says co-author michael gillon , principal investigator of the spitzer telescope program . ` this is the first time that we see light from a planet that is that small . ' ¿ it ¿ s like in the movie ¿ avatar , ¿ where pandora orbits the gas giant polyphemus . seeing polyphemus from pandora gives an idea of how big the star would look from 55 cancri e ' say the researchers . from the planet 's infrared light , the researchers precisely calculated its temperature -- a scorching 2,360 degrees kelvin , or 3,700 ° f. with such high temperatures , demory posits that the planet is likely rather dark , having no reflective surfaces such as ice caps , and probably absorbs most of the heat given off by its star . the planet 's temperature may also give researchers a clue about its atmosphere . 55 cancri e orbits its star much like the moon circles earth , always presenting the same face . demory suspects that much of 55 cancri e 's heat remains on the ` day side ' of the planet , and that it would be difficult to circulate such high temperatures to the planet 's dark side : in other words , it 's unlikely that the super-hot planet harbors any strong winds . phil armitage , an associate professor of astrophysics at the university of colorado , says it 's extremely difficult for any instrument -- including the spitzer telescope -- to make a direct detection of an exoplanet . he sees the group 's detection as ` a great example of really pushing an instrument to its limits . ' he adds that the planet 's infrared light will help identify more characteristics from this particular super-earth . ; super-earths are fascinating objects because they do n't have any analogs in the solar system , ' armitage says . ` we do n't have a clear idea how they formed or even what they 're made of . it 's a mystery that requires data beyond the planet 's mass and radius to resolve . '	 first time infrared light from planet this small has ever been detected .   super earth is twice the size of ours .   surface of 55 cancri e - 40 light years from earth - is hot enough to melt steel .   planet may lack reflective surfaces such as ice caps - and absorb all of star 's heat .

73	by . simon walters . published : . 16:04 est , 9 june 2012 . | . updated : . 16:04 est , 9 june 2012 . fears : lord coe talking to the mail on sunday . olympics chief sebastian coe has launched an outspoken attack on reality tv , warning that it could wreck britain 's hopes of producing future olympic champions . lord coe , who won his first olympic gold in 1980 , said shows such as the x factor encourage young people to think they can become ` famous for nothing ' . the chairman of the london organising committee of the olympic and paralympic games -lrb- locog -rrb- said : ' i do n't decry all reality tv . it identifies talent , but it encourages people to think you can be a celebrity in six hours . ' i joined an athletics club when i was 11 years old and did n't get to the olympics until i was 23 . ` we have to be careful we do n't create a celebrity-driven culture where young people think it is better to be famous for nothing than be anonymous for doing something creative . ' in an exclusive and wide-ranging interview with the mail on sunday , lord coe - who remains the only man to win gold in the 1500m at successive olympics - also spoke candidly about his ` tough ' school days and the extraordinary influence of his late father and coach . sleek and slim as ever at the age of 55 , wearing a pink shirt with the top two buttons open and reclining in his 23rd-floor office in london 's canary wharf , lord coe looks the archetypal , well-groomed city slicker . fame : simon cowell with fellow celebrity judge cheryl cole on the x factor . yet he failed his 11-plus and his was no gilded upbringing . ` if you were brought up in sheffield in the seventies , went to an inner-city secondary modern and your name was sebastian , you learned how to survive . it was tough . you learn to handle yourself . ' his steely core comes as much from his formidable father peter as it does from his native city . during the second world war , peter coe survived his ship being torpedoed . picked up by a german boat , he later escaped en route to a prisoner-of-war camp by leaping off a train and walking across the pyrenees to spain . but there he was jailed for six months for having the wrong papers . years later , he had a blazing row with a bolshie athletics official and his son commented : ` you do n't scare easily . ' peter , who died in 2008 , replied : ' i do n't scare at all . the last 43 years have been a f ****** bonus . ' when coe lost the 800m olympic final to his great rival steve ovett in 1980 , his father told him - and the world 's media - he had ` run like a **** ' . unlike modern budding olympians , lord coe 's only sponsors were his hard-up parents . gold rush : lord coe leads the 1500m semi-final , followed by spain 's jose abascal , at the 1984 los angeles olympics , where he won gold . ` it bred a hardier competitor , ' he says . ` no athlete is going to underperform in london because of lack of funding . the national lottery has changed the landscape . ' the words are said with feeling . however , he admits today 's youngsters have more distractions . ` when i first joined an athletics club , it was the focus of my world . there was little tv and no computer games . ' lord coe also touched on the possibility that sprinter dwain chambers , whose ban on competing because of a drugs offence was overturned earlier this year , could wear a gb vest at the 2012 games . ' i am unreconstructed on this , ' he says . ' i would like to see a life ban . if you take drugs to artificially enhance your performance , you are stepping out of the moral framework of sport . ' athletes on drugs who competed for the soviet union in lord coe 's heyday had an excuse , he says . ` they had no idea they were being given drugs at the breakfast table . ' of chambers , lord coe says : ` if he competes he should receive every courtesy . ' but he warns : ` drugs cheats should think very carefully before coming to london : we have the most advanced tests in any games . you run a serious risk of getting caught . ' overturned : dwain chambers runs the 4x100 relay in rome last month . turning to britain 's chances this summer , lord coe is far from confident about achieving the target of finishing fourth in the medals table , as in beijing , when we nudged australia into fifth place by a single bronze medal . ` you do n't have to give the aussies much of an excuse to get back at you . it 's in their dna . ' he says the germans , french , japanese and south koreans pose the biggest threat . lord coe 's steely core is again evident in his defence of his # 357,000-a-year salary as locog chairman . lord coe , who travels in a chauffeur-driven bmw 7 series , says he is worth it : on a typical day , he starts work at 7am and finishes at midnight . he also defends the ruthless way ` olympic police ' have stopped anyone else exploiting the games ' commercial potential . an east end kebab shop called ` olympic ' was forced to change to ` lympic ' . ' i am unashamedly protective of it , ' he avows . ' i have to protect the people who have put a lot of money into this . i am going to get this project across the line with a balanced budget so the public wo n't have to pick up the bill . ' rumours : lord coe 's judo sessions with william hague fuelled bogus rumours they were gay . lord coe was a tory mp from 1992 to 1997 and william hague 's chief of staff when the former conservative party leader was defeated in the 2001 general election . he became a peer in 2000 . his spell with hague is best remembered for their lunchtime judo sessions , which fuelled bogus rumours that they were gay . ` gay ? ' splutters lord coe , in fits of laughter . ` there was nothing weird about it . when william became leader , he said to me , ' i know how hard this job is going to be . i need to be in shape . what do i do ? ' i said , ` what sports do you like ? ' he said , ` martial arts . '' lord coe arranged for them to wrestle on the judo mat , supervised by olympic silver medallist ray stevens . ` william got up to a blue belt . ' lord coe has four children by ex-wife , equestrian nicola mcirvine , and had an affair with fashion designer vanessa lander in the nineties . he married magazine editor carole annett , ten years his junior , last july . his friends say his ambition is to be president of the international olympic committee . lord coe plays it down but , like the canny politician he is , does not rule it out . if london 2012 goes well , his credentials will be as unbeatable as he was on the track .	 games chief attacks reality tv for encouraging young people to think it is better to be famous for nothing than be anonymous for doing something creative .   lord coe touches on possibility of former drugs cheat dwain chambers competing for gb at london 2012 .   the two-time 1500m champion is confident britain will hit games target of fourth in the medals table .   he laughs off bogus william hague gay rumours .

' dexter , who gave up alcohol because of ` over-consumption ' , said he is often asked why he killed off morse . he explained that the character 's death would have been inevitable because of his unhealthy lifestyle and famous fondness for whisky . partners in solving crime : inspector morse and his partner sergeant lewis . the novelist added : ` i was asked if i thought of an epitaph for him -lsb- morse -rsb- , and remembered `` under this sod lies another '' . ' he told how everyone praised him , telling him what a ` clever chap ' he was , when really he had taken the quote from spike milligan . whately has also recently hinted that the drama might not last much longer . ` i 'm now police retirement age this year , so the time is coming quite soon , i think , ' he said . around 13million viewers tuned in to watch the last episode of morse in 2000 , and there was a huge outpouring of sadness for the detective 's demise . but lewis fans can take some solace . following its success earlier in the year , a full series of endeavour , starring shaun evans as the young morse , has now been commissioned . evans won over critics and viewers alike with his portrayal of the young detective . ratings for the one-off film , which was broadcast in january to mark the 25th anniversary of the very first episode of morse , were 8.2 million .	 colin dexter predicts next series of lewis will be last .   believes the show has become ` ridiculously complex '

' however , not everyone is happy by the rise of the portly pigeons , which can be distinguished from those more traditionally seen in towns and cities by their bigger bodies and white collars . they have voracious appetites and often hog the bird table , swiftly eating the treats left for smaller birds . the bto suggests buying seed mixes which are low on cereal , one the wood pigeon 's favoured foods . cages placed around bird tables and feeders will allow access for smaller bird while leaving wood pigeons to forage for themselves . dr tim harrison , of the bto 's garden birdwatch project , said : ` wood pigeons cause ill-feeling amongst some garden bird enthusiasts - it is easy to see just a big stomach on legs . ` but there are things that you can do that mean you can still enjoy them coming into your garden , bringing a sense of the countryside with them .

' buffett , one of the world 's richest men and chairman of conglomerate berkshire hathaway inc , said his federal tax bill last year was $ 6,938,744 . ` that sounds like a lot of money . but what i paid was only 17.4 per cent of my taxable income - and that 's actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office . ` their tax burdens ranged from 33 per cent to 41 per cent and averaged 36 per cent , ' he said . lawmakers engaged in a partisan battle over spending and taxes for more than three months before agreeing on august 2 to raise the $ 14.3 trillion u.s. debt ceiling , avoiding a u.s. default . mr buffett said : ` americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of congress to deal with our country 's fiscal problems . ` only action that is immediate , real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness . ' he said higher taxes for the rich will not discourage investment and cited the example of the eighties when rates were much higher . buffett , one of the world 's richest men and chairman of conglomerate berkshire hathaway inc , said his federal tax bill last year was $ 6,938,744 . ` back in the 1980s and 1990s , tax rates for the rich were far higher , and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack . ` according to a theory i sometimes . hear , i should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the . elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends . ' i have worked with investors for 60 years and i have yet to see anyone - not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 per cent in 1976-77 - shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain . ` people invest to make money , and potential taxes have never scared them off . ' he also commented that raising taxes would create jobs , contrary to popular belief , saying : ` and to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation , i would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000 . you know what 's happened since then : lower tax rates and far lower job creation ' speaking on behalf of the country 's wealthy , he also said that the rich would not have a problem paying more taxes , if it meant they were helping the country out of a debt hole . ' i know well many of the mega-rich and , by and large , they are very decent people , ' he said . ` they love america and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them . ` many have joined the giving pledge , promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy . most would n't mind being told to pay more in taxes as well , particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering .

' the report continues : ` although there . is nothing wrong with seeking recovery from a defendant in a civil . suit , the complainant 's disavowal of any financial interest is relevant . to her credibility .

' the government calls the attacks . religion-based hate crimes meant to humiliate amish who cite scripture . in keeping beards after they are married and , for women , growing their . hair long . community : amish leave the cleveland , ohio federal courthouse where the case began last week . support : women leave the court , where 16 members of the community stand trial for cutting hair . but the defense has tried to portray the . attacks as internal church disciplinary matters , not a religion-based . hate crime as prosecutors argue . ` ringleader ' : sam mullet , sr. is accused of staging the attacks in a response to criticism of his leadership . defense attorneys questioned zimmerly about how accused ringleader , sam mullet sr. , escorted his son and nephew when they surrendered , apparently to show he had cooperated with police . the trial started last week and could last several weeks . the charges include conspiracy , assault and evidence tampering in steubenville , eastern ohio farm country . those accused of planning and taking part in the attacks targeted the hair and beards of amish bishops as it has spiritual significance for the faith , prosecutors said . such hair-cutting attacks are offensive . to the amish because they believe women let their . hair grow long and men to grow beards after marriage to show devotion to god . prosecutors said there were five separate attacks last year , orchestrated by mullet . all the defendants could face lengthy prison terms if convicted on charges . mullet has denied ordering the hair-cutting but said he did n't stop anyone from carrying it out . last year he said that the hair-cutting was a response to criticism of his leadership from other amish bishops . ` they changed the rulings of our . church here , and they 're trying to force their way down our throat , make . us do like they want us to do , and we 're not going to do that , ' mullet . said . on trial : miller -lrb- second right -rrb- sits next to , from left , johnny mullet , lester mullet , daniel mullet and his son eli miller in court in millersburg , ohio last year . they are all charged with teh hate crimes . attorneys for the defendants have not denied the hair cuttings took place and said members of the group took action as they were concerned that some amish were straying from their beliefs . they also contended that the amish are bound by different rules guided by their religion and that the government should not get involved in what amounted to a family or church dispute .	 levi miller ` admitted he had been involved and was sorry he was caught '   he is one of 16 amish men accused of slicing off hair and beards last year .   detective recounts horrified scenes after community leader 's beard was cut . 
137	by . associated press . updated : . 12:32 est , 5 october 2011 . a third of u.s. veterans of the post-9 / 11 military believes the wars in iraq and afghanistan were not worth fighting for , it has emerged . many of them also think that after 10 years of fighting america should focus more on its own problems instead of foreign affairs , according to an opinion survey . the findings highlight a dilemma for the obama administration and congress as they struggle to tackle the government 's huge budget deficits and reconsider defence priorities while trying to maintain public support for those still in iraq and afghanistan . ` not worth it ' : many veterans believe that after 10 years of fighting america should focus more on its own problems , according to the survey . human cost of war : almost 4,500 u.s. troops have died in iraq and about 1,700 in afghanistan with the combined costs of the conflicts topping $ 1trillion . almost 4,500 u.s. troops have died in iraq and about 1,700 in afghanistan with the combined costs of the wars since the september 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 topping $ 1trillion . the pew research center 's poll reveals the post-9 / 11 veterans are proud of their work but are scarred by warfare and convinced the american public has little understanding of the problems wartime service has created for the military and their families . the survey also showed that post-9 / 11 veterans are more likely than americans as a whole to call themselves republicans and to disapprove of president barack obama 's performance as commander in chief . they also are more likely than earlier generations of veterans to have no religious affiliation . the study was described as the ` first of its kind ' by the pew research center , a politically-impartial organisation which studies attitudes and trends . the survey was based on two polls conducted between late july and mid-september . one survey questioned 1,853 veterans - including 712 who had served in the military after 9/11 but are no longer on active duty . of these 712 post-9 / 11 veterans , 336 served in iraq or afghanistan . the second poll surveyed 2,003 adults who had not served in the military . nearly half of post-9 / 11 veterans said deployments strained their relationship with their spouses , and a similar share reported problems with their children . however , 60 per cent said they and their families benefited financially from having served abroad in a combat zone . the war veterans used words such as ` rewarding , ' ` nightmare , ' ` eye opening , ' ` lousy , ' when asked to descried their experiences . there are about 98,000 u.s. troops in afghanistan , where the conflict began with a u.s.-led invasion on oct. 7 , 2001 . obama campaigned for the presidency in 2008 on getting out of iraq and ramping up the military campaign in afghanistan . he is on track to remove all u.s. troops out of iraq by the end of this year , and in july he announced that he would pull 10,000 troops out of afghanistan this year and 23,000 more by next september . the pew survey found that veterans are ambivalent about the net value of the wars , although they generally were more positive about afghanistan , which has been a more protracted but less deadly conflict for u.s. forces . one-third of post-9 / 11 veterans said neither war was worth the sacrifices ; that was the view of 45 percent in the separate poll of members of the general public . fifty percent of veterans said afghanistan was worth it , whereas the poll of civilians put it at 41 per cent . combat zone : the survey reveals post-9 / 11 veterans are proud of their work but are scarred by warfare . among veterans , 44 percent said iraq was worth it . that compares with 36 percent in the poll of civilians . of the surveyed former service members who were seriously wounded or knew someone who was killed or seriously wounded , 48 per cent said the war in iraq was worth fighting , compared with 36 percent of those veterans who had no personal exposure to casualties . exposure to casualties had an even larger impact on attitudes toward the war in afghanistan . fifty-five per cent of those exposed to casualties said afghanistan has been worth the cost to the u.s. , whereas 40 per cent of those who were not exposed to casualties held that same view . pew said its survey results found ` isolationist inclinations ' among post-9 / 11 war veterans . about 6-in-10 said the united states should pay less attention to problems overseas and instead concentrate on problems at home . in a pew survey conducted earlier this year , a similar share of the general public agreed . the survey also reflected what many view as a troublesome cultural gap between the military and the general public . although numerous polls have shown that americans hold the military in high regard , the respondents in the pew research acknowledged a lack of understanding of what military life entails . only 27 percent of adult civilians said the public understands the problems facing those in uniform , and the share of veterans who said so is even lower - 21 percent .	 veterans believe america should focus on its on problems , poll reveals .

' a 2009 report in the american journal of public health studied traffic fatalities in the u.s. from 1995 to 2005 and found that more than 12,500 deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits on all kinds of roads . the study also said that rural highways showed a 9.1 per cent increase in fatalities on roads where speed limits were raised , but did not cite specific numbers in those instances . most highways in the u.s. top out at 75 mph , and there are no longer any roads in the u.s. with no speed limit like germany 's autobahn . some highways in rural west texas and utah have 80 mph speed limits . the texas legislature last year approved 85 mph limits for some new stretches of road . the strip of toll road running from austin to seguin , about 35 miles northeast of san antonio , will be the first to allow that speed when it opens in november . the texas transportation commission , which is appointed by gov. rick perry , approved the 85 mph speed limit at a public meeting on august 30 . a transportation department spokesman said commissioners would not comment on their decision . record speeds : map shows top speed limits across the u.s . agency officials had previously said they would study the toll road 's topography , the speeds that most drivers were reaching , and the safety of access points and cross sections before approving the 85 mph speed limit . ` safety is our top priority and tests have shown the designated speed is a safe one , ' agency spokeswoman veronica beyer said . alan guckian , who lives in austin and regularly drives to seguin to visit family , said he 'll likely use the road for convenience and the pleasure of driving fast . ' i would love it , ' guckian said . ` sometimes it 's fun to just open it up . ' steve marcy sometimes uses another part of the toll road on his daily commute from round rock , north of austin , to his job in san antonio . the section he drives now has an 80 mph speed limit . marcy said he 'd be comfortable driving 85 , but would be concerned about others driving vehicles that are not in good condition . ' a tire blowout -lrb- at 85 mph -rrb- could be a big hazard , ' marcy said . chris lippincott , spokesman for sh 130 concession co. that is building the road , said the company is committed to operating a safe highway . ` on any road , drivers hold the key to safety based on traffic , travel conditions and the capabilities of their own vehicles , ' lippincott said . toll prices have not yet been set for the new section . marcy predicted the higher speed limit will attract new drivers , but said most wo n't think it 's worth the cost of the tolls . ` for most people i talk to , it 's a cost issue , ' marcy said .	 will be top speed limit in the united states .   highway safety experts warn could lead to increase in road accidents .   more than 12,500 u.s. deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits between 1995 and 2005 .   the top speed on most highways in the u.s. is 75 .   mph , and there are no longer any roads in the u.s. with no speed limit .   like germany 's autobahn .

' the couple made the confession -- and a few others -- to television presenter phillip schofield when they appeared on his show all star mr and mrs last night . lord prescott said he regretted disposing of the dress and had not realised its value at the time . the 74-year-old explained : ` when we got married she bought a wedding dress but she never told me how much it cost . at the time she told me she would turn it into a cocktail dress but she never did . ` we also had this big box and we used to carry it from house to house . one day i said let 's get rid of it . she was pregnant at the time . so we went down to the corporation tip and we dumped it . ` she never told me how much the wedding dress was but she has been going to those boutiques for years ' . ` mystery and surprise ' : lord prescott , left , and his wife , right , each donned headphones during parts of the show so they could n't hear what the other was saying . the couple also admitted that another source of conflict between them is the kitchen . lord prescott said : ` pauline wishes i had two offices so i would not use her kitchen as an office . she always complains about that . ` there was a time when tony blair rang up and she was banging the pots and pans in the kitchen and i said `` listen love , can you shut up , i am talking to tony '' and she said `` this is my kitchen , not your office . and who is tony ? '' ` tony blair then came on the phone and said : `` i heard that . '' ` i was trying to get tony and gordon to agree and there she was banging the plates . it was a crucial moment . she deliberately goes around banging plates so you ca n't hear the phone . ' however , while the couple were quick to confess their more amusing marital conflicts in front of a studio audience on the itv show , there was one bump in the road that did not get a mention . in 2006 , it emerged that lord prescott had carried out an affair with his glamorous secretary tracey temple , a divorcee 24 years his junior . the two-year fling began at an office christmas party in 2002 after months of flirtation . the pair continued secret trysts at the politician 's grace-and-favour flat in whitehall and at dorneywood , his 215-acre country retreat in buckinghamshire , until 2004 . last year , lord prescott said : ` it was stupid . i 've got no excuse really . people talk about mid-life crisis but i think it was part of an opportunity that developed .

' as part of a voluntary settlement , the former professor has accepted several professional restrictions for the next three years . new job : hauser currently works with at-risk youth at the alternative education program at cape cod collaborative . hauser has agreed to have any research supported by the u.s. public health service supervised , to exclude himself from serving as an adviser to the phs , and to have his employer guarantee the accuracy of his data and methodology before applying for federal funding . according to his linkedin profile , hauser currently works with at-risk youth at the alternative education program at cape cod collaborative . houser , a published author of popular books favored by the media , gained wide recognition for his research into the evolutionary roots of human abilities , including language , and whether morality was inborn or learned . less than a week ago , hauser 's former ivy league employer made national headlines after it has been revealed that 125 students at the prestigious institution are being investigated for allegedly cheating on a take-home exam .	 marc hauser , 52 , researched evolutionary roots of human abilities .   probe by office of research integrity found hauser responsible for six cases of scientific misconduct .   allegedly fabricated data in a paper on monkeys ' ability to learn syllables .   currently works with at-risk youth at cape cod collaborative .

' tragic : melissa bassi , 16 , suffered horrific injuries in the explosion and was rushed to hospital but died a short while later from her injuries . paramedics and police were immediately at the scene and tv footage showed scenes of chaos as shocked students gathered outside the building . investigators initially linked organised crime to the blast , close to the morvillo falcone school in brindisi . the town is home to the local mafia known as the united sacred crown who have close links with the russian and albanian crime and are linked to drug and gun running . the school is named after francesca morvillo falcone , who was the wife of anti mafia judge giovanni falcone , who were both killed in a bomb blast in 1992 which was carried out by the sicilian mafia . but today a senior official said the attack was probably carried out by a lone individual and played down earlier suspicions of mafia involvement . a cctv image of a man wanted in connection with the attack was issued by police on sunday evening . rescue : a woman receives first aid after the explosion outside francesca morvillo falcone high school . panic : emergency services and passers-by rush to help those injured in the blast . brindisi chief prosecutor in charge of the investigation said it now appeared unlikely that either the sicilian mafia or the united sacred crown , were involved . marco dinapoli said : ` the most probable hypothesis is that it was an isolated act . it seems improbable , not entirely to be excluded , that it is connected with mafia networks . he also said that attacks on other schools appeared unlikely and that police already had a facial composite picture of a suspect connected to the blast . suspicions of mafia involvement were fed not only by the fact that the school was named after the wife of a murdered anti-mafia judge , but also by the timing . the attack took place days before the 20th anniversary of the couple 's death in a bomb attack in sicily . thousands took to the streets in demonstrations of sympathy and outrage at the mafia on saturday - but dinapoli said it was still unclear what had prompted the attack . he said investigators had acquired ` significant ' video evidence that suggested one man had set off the device which exploded as pupils were getting off a bus for the start of lessons on saturday morning . the footage showed a man of about 50 years of age activating a remote control to detonate a rudimentary bomb made of three gas canisters hidden in a container outside the school gates , he said . ` it could be a person who feels at war with the world . it could be someone who wants to create tension for some ideological reason , ' dinapoli said . mourning : flowers are placed outside the school in brindisi where the blast happened . tributes : dozens of melissa bassi 's friends have left tributes on her facebook page . the devices were hidden in a bin about 30metres from the brindisi courthouse and as they exploded students arriving for lessons caught the full impact of the blasts . debris was scattered over a wide area with shrapnel from the canisters piercing shutters of nearby shops and blowing out windows of apartment buildings overlooking the scene . tv footage showed scenes of desperation as shoes and rucksacks were scattered over the floor , abandoned by the students as the bombs went off just as students arrived for lessons . although security across italy has been stepped up with fears of anarchist attacks due to the drastic economic situation the theory quickly gathering momentum was a never before heard of attack on innocent schoolchildren by the mafia . demonstration : local residents protest the explosion near the high school today . search begins : firefighters and forensic officers investigate the shrapnel-covered scene . blame : brindisi 's mayor , mimmo consales , accused the mafia or carrying out the attack , but officials later ruled out organised criminal involvement in the attack . concealed : the devices were hidden in a bin about 30m from the brindisi courthouse . one eye witness who works in the court building which overlooks the school told italian media : ' i was just opening the window when the blast caught me in full . ` when i looked down i saw all the kids on the floor , they were covered in black and their books were on fire . it was an infernal scene . who could have done something like this ? they were just kids . ' prime minister mario monti cut short a visit to the united states to return home to cope with the aftermath of both the attack and an earthquake in northern italy in which at least six people died . in shocked brindisi , a port town on italy 's adriatic coast where ferries leave for greece , photographs of a smiling melissa were posted around the city and businesses carrying signs declaring they were in mourning . people placed flowers at police barriers around the 1970s-era school where pupils study fashion , tourism and social services . devastating : shrapnel pierced shutters of nearby shops as the blast blew out windows of apartments . blast : two powerful explosions scattered deadly shrapnel across a wide area just as students were arriving for lessons at morvillo falcone school . another girl injured in the attack , veronica capodieci , has been transferred to a hospital in the larger city of lecce . she is still in serious condition , but the hospital reported on sunday that she was stable and had regained consciousness . the deadly attack on a group of young students was shock the whole country at a time when it is already grappling with economic unrest and political scandals . franco scoditti , the mayor of melissa 's home town of mesagne , near brindisi , said : ` the school is a symbol of innocence and hope . ` the moment a school is attacked you have to ask yourself where things are heading . ' shocked : one eyewitness said : ` it was an infernal scene . who could have done something like this ? they were just kids ' investigation : italian firefighters inspect the site where an explosive device went off .	 initial suggestions of mafia involvement in the bombing have since been played down by officials .   cctv image issued of man italian police are seeking in connection with the attack .   two explosions scattered shrapnel just as students were arriving for lessons .   melissa bassi , 16 , died after suffering horrific injuries in the explosion .   a second girl who was in a ` life threatening ' condition has since stabilised .

' the commissioner said he was only touring the district with his fiancée during a layover . they were flying to see his daughter , the commissioner said . the picture of him and the woman he identified as his fiancée may be viewed on mr keatley 's personal blog , along with other photos of angeles city 's red-light district . according to mr keatley , wiener first identified the woman accompanying him as his girlfriend . however , when kob looked into his flight schedules , they could not find a flight schedule to caticlan , where his daughter was . in an interview with the albuquerque journal , wiener would not say whether or not he knew he was wandering around the red-light district . he did say that he ` just wanted to take a quick tour , ' comparing it to people wanting to see the casinos at las vegas , even if they did n't gamble . mr keatley , who works as a professional photographer who shoots portraits and advertising , told a different tale . he told tpm 's muckraker blog ` it was very obvious to me that -lrb- wiener -rrb- was not respectful to women . he was there to have a good time . ' the photographer said that people travel the world over to visit the city 's booming red light district.he said that he heard wiener making inappropriate jokes to the women -- called ` bar girls ' -- suggesting that one of them touch his penis . wiener vehemently denied the claim . ` i may have made a comment like do n't get too close to my girlfriends here , but i did n't mention anything like that , ' wiener told kob . the other weiner : former congressman anthony weiner -lrb- d-ny -rrb- was forced to resign after a series of illicit photos were posted to his twitter account ; he is seen speaking in june of last year . laid bare : weiner denied claims that he sent a picture of his bulging underwear to a young woman , but confessed last june that was , in fact , him . he also issued a statement thursday that read : ` i 'm a hard-working commissioner who has a right to take a vacation , to visit my fiancée and my daughter . i did absolutely nothing wrong - i was a tourist on my own time -- not there on county business -lrb- sic -rrb- my time is my time ! ' in the statement , he rhetorically asked : ` if i was doing something wrong -- why would i pose for a picture ? ' now , wiener is facing considerable heat to resign from his public office position . michelle lujan grishman , who serves as a commissioner with the new mexico state bar , said the photos call for wiener 's resignation . she told kob : ` during most of his career at the county , there have been allegations of inappropriate behaviour that borders on racism , sexual harassment , hostile work environments , and these pictures seem to condemn human trafficking and then exploitation of women . ' last year , wiener was cleared in an investigation after a female staffer complained that he made off-colour , sexually explicit comments to her , saying : ` did you know that the -lrb- county commission -rrb- now has a wiener and a johnson on it ? ' though he admitted that he made the statement , wiener said it was intended to be taken as a joke.the albuquerque journal noted another gaffe , where he referred to a santa fe man as ` very hispanic and not very sophisticated -- very very blue collar . ' during their encounter in the red-light district , mr keatley was unaware that wiener was a politician , and had no idea who he was until wiener handed him his email address and requested that mr keatley send him the photos . wiener is up for re-election this year .	 new mexico commissioner michael wiener photographed with four filipino ` bar girls ' on recent trip .   wiener claims he was exploring red-light district while on layover .   shares remarkably similar surname to shamed former u.s. rep. anthony weiner .

' the strain , called legionella longbeachae , is found naturally in soil but very rarely causes disease in this country . more than 98 per cent of cases are caused by legionella pneumonophila bacteria . both forms are spread by tiny water droplets in the air . they are not contagious and can be treated with antibiotics if caught early -- but around one in ten cases are fatal . in 2010 , doctors in paisley , scotland , told how a previously healthy 67-year-old man came in to hospital with the rare strain after an eight-day fever . they told the lancet medical journal the man , who survived , was a keen gardener who had cut his index finger while planting with compost . dr martin donaghy , medical director of health protection scotland , said : ` we need to take steps to reduce the risk . '	 one man has died and five taken ill in unrelated cases .   rare strain is ` legionella longbeachae ' , which authorities believe comes from compost .   six compost cases are first to be confirmed in britain .

' but roseanne was clearly touched by his appearance . ` i 'd really like to thank tom for . showing up . it was very brave and he was very funny , ' roseanne said when . she took the stage to sup up the roast . they can laugh now : the couple 's acrimonious split wad depressingly mirthless . ` white trash camelot ' : that 's how tom described his life with the famous comedian . however , her acerbic touch had returned and she said of the man she hired to work in a plum role on her eponymous hit show : ` but jesus christ how many . jobs do i have to get that guy ? ' arnold did offer a recap of their ` white-trash camelot ' life together before tackling their sex life and gently poking fun at his former wife 's notorious temper . tom had previously ruled himself out of an appearance at the roast , which made it all the more surprising . and after the couple 's acrimonious split , nobody was much surprised . tom ended his surprise appearance with . complimentary comments about roseanne 's rise to fame after . appearing on the tonight show starring johnny carson , declaring , ` roseanne , you were my johnny carson , ' and then thanking her ` from the . bottom of my heart ' for launching his career . so happy together : the couple married in 1990 and seemed to be made for each other , initially . mixing business with pleasure : it was n't long before roseanne had given tom a job on her titular hit sitcom . jane lynch served as master of . ceremonies at the event , and used the opportunity to make a dig at the . chick-fil-a anti-same-sex marriage controversy . other celebrity roasters included . carrie fisher , wayne brady , ellen barkin , katey sagal , gilbert . gottfried , jeffery ross . the comedy central roast of roseanne airs august . 12 at 10 p.m. barr , who now lives with partner johnny argent , in hawaii initially seemed deliriously happy with arnold . moved on : roseanne lives with her partner in hawaii . the couple mud-wrestled for a vanity fair cover before showing off their tattooed backsides to a stadium full of '89 world series fans . but before long there were reports of screaming rows on the set of roseanne after its titular star employed her younger husband as an executive producer . she then fired him on the spot after accusing him of having an affair with his assistant , and before long she filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences . she wrote in the papers : ' i now realize that i have been a classic battered and abused wife . ' ` throughout our marriage -lsb- tom -rsb- hit me , struck me , has thrown objects at me , pinched me and verbally abused me . ' this led to a showdown , when he allegedly stormed onto the set to confront her , scratching and hitting four people before he was finally escorted off the premises . roseanne also demanded a restraining order against tom . ' i am extremely afraid for my physical safety , ' she said . her petition was granted . arnold later claimed that he and roseanne were fine and that she was unaware of the charges made by her lawyers , but admitted they had slanging matches on set . his relationship with assistant kim silva also caused problems , despite her being so close to roseanne that they offered up a mock three way wedding . friends of the couple also doubted the claims of abuse and roseanne herself recalled that she became detached from reality during this period . comedy central will be cutting a joke told by jeffrey ross at the roast when it airs because it refers to the aurora shooting and alleged murderer james holmes . ross was heckling fellow comedian seth green when he compared him to the alleged shooter . ` seth , congratulations . this is actually a great night for you , ' ross said according to the hollywood reporter . ` you have n't gotten this much attention since you shot all those people in aurora . ' seth green was also there to roast barr and was picked out by ross for his red hair . ross was comparing green 's hair to the dyed orange hair of james holmes . ross went on to say that he was only joking . he then added , ` you are not like james holmes . at least he did something in a movie theater that people remember !

' scott 's diary for february 24 mentions a significant fuel shortage and , three days later , he writes that the team had less food than they expected to have . mr turney makes the claims in his book 1912 : the year the world discovered antarctica , published this week . but roland huntford , author of a dual biography of scott and his norwegian rival roald amundsen , disagrees that mr evans can be blamed . he said : ` the food depots were badly organised and it would have been all but impossible for evans and his men to know how much food was rightfully theirs . ` it was entirely scott 's fault because of poor organisation . '	 academic chris turney , of the university of new south wales , sydney , says one of the team may have eaten more than his fair share of food , leaving the others starving .

' the couple and daughter rebecca , 26 , used to live on takeaway food most nights but now eat healthy meals in small portions . they both began considering surgery after a holiday in the dominican republic last year . mrs brassell said : ` we got talking to another holidaymaker who had recently had weightloss surgery and was very pleased with the results and that set me off thinking . ` when we got home , i said to david that i 'd been considering looking into having surgery and he actually said he 's been thinking the same thing . ' lifestyle change : mrs brassell , who works for asda , used to eat takeaway meals every night with her family , but now has small healthy dishes . in september last year , the couple went to see their gp . mrs brassell was referred to the bariatric surgery centre in darlington and mr brassell was advised to try medication first . she added : ' i think the hardest thing was walking into the seminar for patients who are thinking about having surgery . ` there were a lot of people there who were even bigger than me . it made me think , `` i am not alone '' . ` david came along to support me at the seminar but we both felt even more strongly after the meeting and after receiving all the information , surgery was the best option for both of us . ` you have to be really committed to change , i had to lose 5kg before the surgery and meet with a dietician to discuss the lifestyle changes you have to make after the operation . ` since the operation i have lost 8st and i feel fantastic . i 've gone from a size 26 to a 14 . ' i used to eat sweets , takeaways , snacks and cakes , but now i have cereal in the morning and healthy meals . ` it is the best thing i have ever done , i feel like it 's a new lease of life and i 've started doing exercise , going to the gym , swimming and circuits . ' mr brassell said : ` it 's the simple things like being able to bend down to fasten your shoelaces and not having an aching back when you walk . ' he admitted that when he and his wife were overweight , he even had to help his wife put her bra on , joking : ' i must have been the only husband who spent more time putting his wife 's bra on rather than taking it off . ' the couple urged anyone who is struggling with obesity to talk to their gp about a possible referral for surgery on the nhs . the darlington bariatric surgery centre has operated on 30 patients since it opened in september and many more are being prepared for surgery . spending on nhs weightloss surgery in the north-east has soared in recent years and the region has the highest rate of of hospital admissions for patients with obesity problems at 40 per 100,000 people . in 2008-09 , # 1.7 m was spent on weight-loss surgery in the region , but that more than doubled to # 3.6 m in 2009-10 and rose again to 4.6 m in 2010-11 . the brassells ' surgeon akeil samier said : ` it is very pleasing to hear the success stories of our patients and to see the difference the surgery has made to the quality of their lives . ` debra and david know patients need to work hard to achieve the weightloss results that they want , but it does work and provides a long-term solution . ' before undergoing gastric surgery for weightloss , patients need to have a body mass index of more than 40 , or more than 35 if they have other medical problems such as high blood pressure . mr samier added : ` these patients will have tried everything beforehand and will have failed with conservative methods . they must be committed to the follow up and to changing their lifestyle and eating habits after the operation , just as david and debra were . '	 takeaway-addicted pair lost 17 stone between them and now eat healthily .   dave brassell was 21 stone and debra brassell was 20 stone .   she suffered from sleep apnoea and his back ached when he walked .

' alfie was diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis , a rare and invasive disease caused by a malformation of the lymphatic system , when he was just 18 months old . it has also left him with brittle bones and his blood does not clot properly , which causes internal bleeding . but against all odds , alfie 's condition has seen a marked improvement since he started taking trial drug sirolimus . he no longer has to visit the hospital every week . the drug is more commonly used as an anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant patients , last september . mrs milne , who also has son lewis , nine , said : ` as far as we are concerned it ' s a miracle drug . i ca n't believe how happy and healthy alfie is today . ` he is getting stronger every day . ` we 've been able to wean him off all his pain relief , an mri scan showed the tumour has reduced in size and it has n't spread . ` it was spreading really quickly and was going up into alfie 's spine but it has n't gone any further . that in itself is fantastic . ` the ultimate goal is to find a cure but this is a breakthrough . it gives us hope . ' alfie 's mother tracy -lrb- pictured -rrb- said : ` this drug is giving alfie the quality of life he should have ' alfie was just six months old , when mrs milne and her husband mark , 43 , noticed his leg appeared swollen when he was in his baby walker . he was eventually diagnosed a year later at great ormond street hospital . alfie 's right leg remains swollen and is around three times larger than the left one . the disease is also making his right leg grow at a faster rate and it is 5cm longer . however alfie , who until recently had to take morphine to combat the pain he was in , has a special shoe with a built-up sole to aid his balance . mrs milne said : ` we 've got him pain free and balanced and he has been able to take his first steps unaided . ` it was very emotional . he just stood up and said : ` mummy , look at me ' , and took three steps . ` he even made me keep it a secret from his dad because he wanted to practice before he showed him . my husband shed a few tears when he saw him walking . ' along with the trial drug , alfie also takes potent cancer drugs once every seven weeks and steroids twice a day to help his blood clot . it is hoped his next session of chemotherapy next month will be his last and that in time he will also be able to come off the steroids . alfie , at nine months old , before he was diagnosed . his parents were concerned that one of his legs appeared swollen . mrs milne now hopes alfie , who was five last month , will be able to walk into school , when he starts there after the summer holidays . she said : ` it 's a major milestone . we did n't really think he would get to mainstream school or even get to school . `` i 'm just so happy he is joining in and doing what he 's supposed to at five years of age . ` he 's a cheeky little character who is always laughing and playing with his brother and asking to have friends around . it 's fantastic he can just be a little boy . ' however , they know there is no guarantee that the drug 's success will continue indefinitely . the family has now set up a charity in their son 's name to help raise money for lymphangiopmatosis and gorham 's disease alliance europe . the organisation aims to fund research for a much-needed cure for the disease , which has a low life expectancy , with only some sufferers surviving 10 years or more . mrs milne said : ` this drug is giving alfie the quality of life he should have and we 've got to hold on to that . ` as long as his body can tolerate the toxins the drug produces he should be able to stay on it , hopefully , for the rest of his life . ` but they do n't know what side affects there could be . we just have to take it one day at a time . ` something like this teaches you not to look too far into the future . we just have to live for today . ' since setting up alfie 's trust at the end of last year , they have raised more than # 40,000 . for more information visit www.alfiemilne.org.uk .	 drug has stopped spread of tumour and alfie has been weaned off pain medication .   the drug is more commonly used as an anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant patients .   ` it gives us hope ' , say parents .

' he also told friends that running two high-profile shows in the uk and america had left him at breaking point . his enforced spell of rest meant he missed key promotional time with the x factor 's new us line-up , which includes britney spears . but cowell revealed he was told to take a rest because his life had ` become like a night shift ' , adding : ` i had forgotten the sensation of the morning . ' his company syco productions officially stated that he had come down with bronchitis . it is understood he took a three-week break from work to recuperate fully . the revelations come as ratings in britain for saturday night 's episode of the x factor dropped to a series low of 7.7 million , with viewers apparently put off by the decision to show fewer performances and more ` behind-the-scenes ' shots . sleeping beauty : simon was advised to get plenty of rest from his doctor after becoming a ` weird vampire ' the ratings will be a blow to cowell as they are some way below the average of more than 10million for the 2010 series . he will be hoping that the surprise reappearance of cheryl cole will provide a boost . the singer left her role as a judge for an ill-fated stint doing the same on the us version of the show , falling out with cowell after she was axed within days . but she has returned to assist gary barlow as a guest mentor for the ` judges ' houses ' stage of the singing competition , which will be screened later in the series . however , it seems that her feud with cowell is not over . after he sent her a twitter message to say ` welcome back ' , the singer said : ` i saw simon 's tweet . i 'm not doing this for him . i am doing this for gary as he 's my friend and he asked me to do it . ' meanwhile , the us version of the x factor is facing increased competition . last week cowell reacted angrily to news that a rival talent show , the us version of the voice , will be screened at the same time as the x factor returns there for a second series . he said : ` it is a spoiling tactic and it 's very simple -- -lsb- the voice broadcaster nbc does n't -rsb- want people to see this first episode ... i think it 's mean-spirited and i hope and i pray that it backfires on them because this is one of the best shows we 've ever made .

' the pair argue that the faa policy on electronic device use should be ` based on evidence rather than on fear ' . in an article for the wall street journal , they argue : ` there is no reason to doubt the anecdotes told by airline personnel about glitches that have occurred on flights when they also have discovered someone illicitly using a device . ` but when thinking about these anecdotes , we do n't consider that glitches also occur in the absence of illicit gadget use . more important , we do n't consider how often gadgets have been in use when flights have been completed without a hitch . ` fear is a powerful motivator , and precaution is a natural response . regulators are loath to make policies less restrictive , out of a justifiable concern for passenger safety . ` once a restriction is in place , though , removing it becomes a challenge because every day without a gadget-induced accident cements our belief that the status quo is right and justified .

' currently uk pilots are limited to 18 hours without sleep - but more than 4 out of ten pilots -lrb- 43 per cent -rrb- already report nodding off in-flight - of whom a third -lrb- 31 per cent -rrb- awoke to find their co-pilot also asleep , mps heard in evidence . despite this , the department for . transport yesterday insisted the eu blueprint would neither compromise . safety nor increase the risk of pilot fatigue . new transport secretary patrick mcloughlin was accused of ¿ rolling over to brussels ¿ after his department approved the rules . in its official response to the mp 's report published yesterday the department of transport defended its backing of the eu flying hours plan and insisted : ` the government believes that the current draft of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- proposals will not lead to a diminution of safety in the uk . ` the proposals are more conservative than current eu rules which were introduced in 2008 and will result in a significant improvement in safety across the eu as a whole . ' but the british airline pilots ' association -lrb- balpa -rrb- has written to mr mcloughlin urging him to ` think again ' . a balpa spokesman said : ` it is clear that the government has chosen to ignore the concerns of thousands of pilots in the uk . it looks like the government are going to roll over to brussels on this . ` europe want british pilots flying more tired more often . so the government response is extremely disappointing . we hope the new transport secretary will change course . ' the row centres around new rules laid out by the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- which was mandated four years ago by brussels to ` harmonise ' flight time limits and shift-patterns across the eu . since the row erupted , brussels has signalled it may compromise on 20 hours . and despite accepting the new rules the government did accept some of the mp 's findings - including a recommendation to investigate ` the potential under-reporting of pilot fatigue ' . ministers said they would also be seeking a strengthening of specific eu ` fatigue ' rules surrounding flight duties and rest periods and ` stricter limits ' on how frequently airlines could use discretion to exceed maximum levels . transport committee chairman louise ellman , labour mp for liverpool riverside , said of the government 's response : ` there are still areas of concern . the jury 's out . the proof will be in their actions . ' a department for transport spokesman said : ` the safety of the travelling public is paramount and we have been quite clear that we would not support any proposals which the uk 's safety regulator - the civil aviation authority - advise do not provide sufficient protection against crew fatigue . ` we are still awaiting easa 's final proposals , but the caa is satisfied that the latest draft rules now provide a level of safety broadly equivalent to those already in place in the uk . '	 under the new rules , pilots could be landing commercial jets after 22 hours awake .   currently uk pilots are limited to 18 .   hours without sleep .   but more than four out of ten pilots .   already report nodding off in-flight .

' scene : all three confrontations between mr malik and ms sarwar took place inside the store , in reading , berkshire . he added : ` amna was used to his language and body language . for her to feel so upset that she had to go to the police , we inferred that it was a serious conflict . ' a family feud spilled over into the pair 's working lives when the married father-of-two walked into the branch in july , last year , while he was meant to be on holiday . after an initial confrontation he left the store only to return later in an agitated state and he approached ms sarwar talking loudly and aggressively , the tribunal heard . however , the dispute reached its peak when he appeared inside the branch a third time several days later when she claims he threatened to ` chop her up ' . another witness , who mistook him for a customer , stated he had been aggressive and threatening . mr malik denies harassing ms sarwar and says his loud voice was simply an attempt to express himself as he struggled against his stutter . out of work : since his dismissal from asda , mr malik has been out of work and claiming job seeker 's allowance . he said : ` he dismissed me because i raised my voice , that is not under my control . ` when i talk with someone , in order to continue the conversation , i have to raise my voice because that helps me .

' i have been told the odds of him having both the conditions are very slim and a good job he did . ` he 's a little miracle . to look at him now you would have no idea . he 's bounced back incredibly well . ' reversed arteries in the little boy 's heart were flooding his lungs with blood and depriving the rest of his body of oxygen , meaning he was in danger of drowning . fighter : conner underwent a gruelling eight-hour operation to widen the holes in his heart to allow more blood through . conner was born a normal happy baby with no complications in june last year . claire and his dad shaun breslin , 26 , took him home to north lanarkshire , scotland , but when he was five weeks old the he stopped eating . he was admitted to glasgow 's yorkhill royal hospital for sick children with a suspected viral infection , but was rushed into intensive care just two hours later , after being diagnosed with tgv . the young boy was suffering from reversed arteries , which instead of pumping blood from his heart into his body , were directing it into his lungs , causing them to fill with blood . in july last year , conner underwent a gruelling eight-hour operation to widen the holes and allow more blood through . since then , the little lad has had open-heart surgery twice more , including a 12-hour procedure in february , where surgeons switched his reversed arteries and closed the holes in his tiny heart . claire added : ` the idea of the first operation to widen the holes was to allow as much oxygenated blood to get into his body through the holes as possible , so he was as strong as he could be for his big operation to fix the defects . relieved : conner 's parents claire and shaun breslin say their boy has made a miraculous recovery and even took his first steps last month . ' i was a nervous wreck throughout all his surgery . it does n't matter how strong you think you are , watching your child be put to sleep for an operation is the worst experience in the world . i remember just breaking down and crying . ` during the big operation he went into surgery at 8.30 am and did n't come out until 9pm . ` after the operation he was so swollen i did n't even recognise him . the only thing that identified him as my child was the birth mark on his calf . there were so many tubes it was like spaghetti junction . ` he 's such a fighter . the doctors said they gave him enough medicine to sedate a donkey for three days but after just one he started kicking . they just could n't get him to sleep . ` he became quite well known on the ward for his night time noise . from that the nurses said they knew he was going to be fine . ' conner was expected to stay in hospital for over two months to recover , but just a week and a half later he was ready to leave , to the amazement of nurses on the ward . he has since made a miraculous recovery and took his first steps last month . claire said : ` we are not religious at all but i believe he is a miracle . to go from being told he may not make it through the night to taking his first steps is amazing . ` he might be a little smaller than other children as he 's growing up but other than that he 's completely normal . ` and by the way he screams there is definitely nothing wrong with his lungs . '	 reversed arteries in conner breslin 's heart were flooding his lungs with blood and depriving him of oxygen .   however , two holes in his heart allowed just enough oxygenated blood to escape to ensure his survival .   conner , how 15 months old , has made a ` miraculous ' recovery from gruelling heart surgery and even took his first steps last month .

' professor dr axel haverich , germany 's most famous transplant surgeon , said : ` marius was already somewhere between heaven and earth when we operated . he was living in a state of almost perpetual anaesthesia . but he is a real fighter . we had a team of 40 and he came through . ' marius was lucky on two counts : both of his parents had compatible blood groups , and their lungs were bigger than his , which is necessary for a successful transplant . ` if we had enough organ donors in germany , the doctors would not have to resort to living donors , ' mr schneider said . ` we are happy and thankful that we and the doctors were able to help marius . ' he and marius ' mother anja had no doubts about each donating a lung to save their boy . ` it was immediately clear what we had to do in order to save our son , ' she said . this or nothing : dr gregor warnecke demonstrates how the operation will work . he had said the transplant was marius ' last chance . crack team : surgeons at the hannover medical university performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed from each parent and then implanted into marius . the procedure took close to six hours . surgeons at the hannover medical university -lrb- mhh -rrb- performed a triple operation using three operating rooms at once with a lung being removed from each parent and then implanted into marius . the procedure took close to six hours . ` the operations went well , the parents were able to leave hospital after ten days , ' added dr warnecke . ` the transplantation worked well with marius . we were able to remove the tubes from him two days after the operation . ' marius was released from hospital after 155 days . and although his quality of life has improved enormously -- he can play football and ride his bike -- his immune system remains weak and he is being tutored at home . marius , whose sister nele shares his love for schalke football club , said : ' i am especially proud of my parents . they gave me their lungs so i could live . now i can keep up with them on bike rides . ' while this was the first procedure of its kind in europe , doctors say it will probably remain an exception because of the need for two donors at a time with the requisite blood groups .	 marius schneider suffers from cystic fibrosis . 
206	kirsty heslewood , 23 , from hertfordshire suffered from selective mutism . known in her school as ` the girl who would n't speak ' , kirsty did n't utter a word outside of her home . her silence was finally broken when her mother sent a video of her talking to be shown in her school assembly .

' i guess it just shows that if you are determined , nurtured and encouraged , you can overcome anything . ' kirsty would speak at home with her family as a child but when she started nursery at the age of four , she became crippled by an inability to speak . silence in class : kirsty did n't speak at school from her first day at nursery until the age of seven . she recalls : ` it started the day i went to nursery school , i remember holding onto my mum 's legs whilst she tried to untie me . i was n't crying , just holding on tight . i did n't want her to leave me and was shocked that i had to stay . i remember just wanting to cry and go home with my little brother . the nursery teachers were trying their best to cheer me up or make me talk to them or the other children . ' i was so shy and scared that i could n't bring myself to speak even though i wanted to . every morning when i was at the nursery , i did n't speak once . ' kirsty 's silence continued when she started primary school where she would n't speak to her friends or even answer the register . she only responded to questions by making signs like nodding her head . while the other children were intrigued by her inability to talk and nicknamed her ` the girl who would n't speak ' , kirsty 's teachers tried various attempts to get her to find her voice , initially without success . ` all the teachers knew that i did n't speak ; some would try to get a sentence out of me , others would just accept it . i remember one teacher shouting at me saying , `` you must answer the register in case there is a fire '' , which just made me cry . ` the school did n't understand what was wrong . they did n't know if it was just a bad case of someone suffering from anxiety or shyness or if i just could n't talk . selective mutism was n't known then . ' selective mutism is a childhood anxiety disorder where a child can not speak in most social situations despite being able to . it usually begins in children under the age of five but often only becomes noticeable when they start school . an estimated one in 150 children suffer from selective mutism in britain . the causes of the problem are varied but can be prompted by a specific phobia , an inherited predisposition to anxiety , or if a child has problems processing sensory information . it can also occur in children who have suffered abuse or trauma . come a long way : today , the beauty queen ca n't believe she was the little girl who suffered with selective mutism . for kirsty , the problem developed from her anxiety at starting nursery , but then her silence at school became a habit she could n't break , even though she wanted to . ' i actually really wanted to be able to talk and play like everyone else , but i felt like it had gone to far to break the silence , ' she said . ` finding that courage to say just one word was the hardest thing and i just could n't do it . ' teachers tried visiting kirsty at her home , where she was a chatty child among her siblings and cousins , but she would freeze up when they were present . childhood disorder : an estimated one in 150 children suffer from selective mutism in britain like kirsty did . kirsty 's mother kerry said it was an anxious time for her to as she could n't fathom why her confident daughter disappeared outside their home . ` kirsty was a very lively and outward going girl at home but when she got in public she just withdrew completely and became the shadow of herself , ' she said . ` looking at her now it is hard to believe she was so shy but at the time it was very worrying as the disorder was not recognised or identified . ' some people doubted whether kirsty could speak at all so kerry decided to prove her daughter had a voice by sending the school a video of kirsty playing at home , where she was talking freely and making voices for a puppet show . kirsty was stunned when the video was shown to her teachers and classmates in an assembly - but it gave her the release she needed to break her silence . she explains : ' i was in a line , ready to walk into a class assembly , the tv was in there , all the teachers , headmaster , deputy head , helpers , cleaners , dinner ladies and anyone else who needed to see this piece of evidence . ' i had no idea what i was about to watch , i thought it would just be a casual afternoon watching a film . ` then they turned the tv on and up i popped playing with sooty and sweep talking properly and making voices for my puppets . ' i was so surprised `` why am i on the tv ? '' i thought to myself , then i saw everyone else 's reactions . the children were shouting `` kirsty can speak '' whilst the teachers just smiled . ` my friends were so surprised and shocked to hear me speak , they started asking questions and talking to me , and eventually i started answering back . once everyone knew my secret i felt i was allowed to talk . ' on the catwalk : kirsty , left , recently joined amy childs to help model the towie star 's fashion range . progress was slow , but kirsty gradually began to talk more and more at school . she continued to be shy when she was at secondary school but gained in confidence when she took her a levels and when her good looks were noticed by modelling agents . she said : ' i started gaining confidence when studying for my a levels as i had to read out aloud in class , do presentations and be confident enough to ask questions . gaining good grades took priority and in the end i felt being shy would n't allow me to do as well . ' i also started getting modelling agencies approach me and doing some modelling work , which also helped my confidence . ' since taking up modelling , kirsty has worked with the only way is essex 's amy childs , modelling her fashion range , and as well as having success in beauty pageants . found her voice : studying for a levels and becoming a model helped kirsty grow in confidence . in march , she impressed the judges to be crowned miss hertfordshire , giving her a place in the miss england final later this year . kirsty said is delighted to be taking part in the competition and her success is testament to how far she has come since being that little girl at school who would n't speak a word . ' i ca n't wait for the miss england grand final ' , she said . ` obviously i would love to win but even if i do n't , the whole experience has been amazing . not only have i made some great friends , but i have increased my confidence , self-esteem and ability to speak . '	 kirsty heslewood , 23 , from hertfordshire suffered from selective mutism .   known in her school as ` the girl who would n't speak ' , kirsty did n't utter a word outside of her home .   her silence was finally broken when her mother sent a video of her talking to be shown in her school assembly .

' -lrb- this -rrb- brings in its wake ferocious competition , strong inequalities , degradation of the environment , the race for consumer goods , family tensions ' . but he has previously said of the scandal : ` the events of recent days about the curia and my collaborators have brought sadness in my heart . ' but he added : ' i want to renew my trust in and encouragement of my closest collaborators and all those who every day , with loyalty and a spirit of sacrifice and in silence , help me fulfill my ministry . '	 the vatileaks scandal broke in january after a journalist revealed letters from a vatican administrator begging the pope not to sack him for corruption .   over the following months other documents were leaked including a number from benedict 's own desk .   the scandal represents one of the greatest breaches of trust and security for the holy see in recent memory .   paolo gabriele , the pope 's butler , has been arrested after papal documents were found in his vatican city apartment .

' baroness warsi 's position is precarious because she is unpopular with some tory backbenchers , who want mr cameron to appoint an mp to the tory chairmanship to give the position more authority . downing street , however , is understood to rate the minister and is keen to keep her in the cabinet . one rumour is that she could be given the job of international development secretary , in charge of britain 's aid programme , in a reshuffle later this year . pressure : david cameron is being attacked by labout for referring baroness warsi to sir alex allen but not jeremy hunt . however , if sir alex rules against her , it could spell the end for her ministerial career . the referral relates to an undeclared relationship with mr hussain , who accompanied her to pakistan in july 2010 and assisted the british high commission with outreach events there . she said mr hussain was her husband 's second cousin and this fact was ` widely known ' . but she added that she did not realise the need to declare they had ` a common business interest as minority shareholders in a small food company ' . labour 's michael dugher , shadow cabinet office minister , said : ` baroness warsi clearly has very serious questions to answer . ` but david cameron 's actions in this case draw into sharp relief his refusal to hold a similar investigation into jeremy hunt , despite clear evidence that he broke the ministerial code by misleading the house of commons on at least three occasions .

' the government blames much of the debt on botched pfi deals which were encouraged by the labour government . these enabled private firms to pay up front for a new cancer ward or maternity department , for example , and the trust would then pay them back in yearly instalments . last week it was announced south london healthcare - responsible for queen elizabeth ii hospital in woolwich , pictured - was being put into special measures as it is on the brink of going bust . but this amount goes up with interest every year and trusts also have to spend large amounts of money maintaining the buildings so they are ` new ' . as such , many have been unable to make these repayments . the nao warns that in future , the nhs will not be able to afford to continue bailing these trusts out . it points out that there is unlikely to be any increase in government spending on the nhs - once inflation is taken into account - for at least the next three years . the future of south london healthcare trust is uncertain but health secretary andrew lansley is likely to make a decision later this year . it covers three hospitals - princess royal university hospital in orpington and queen mary 's hospital in sidcup in kent and the queen elizabeth hospital in woolwich , south london - and any may be closed-down .	 taxpayers ' money spent on bailing out hospitals has trebled .   south london trust on the verge of going bust .   government blames labour pfi deals .   margaret hodge mp describes figures as ` shocking '

' spaulding was given eight months suspended prison sentence by judge hagen in 2010 for handling stolen goods and shoplifting . on that occasion neil treharne , defending spaulding , said : ` she 's well aware that this is her last chance . ' mr treharne , again representing spaulding today , asked the judge to give his client a spell at outreach centre eden house project instead of jail . defending , neil treharne , said : ` the eden house project is a very worthwhile project . ` i have seen great success in the past and on this occasion i really think that sundee is motivated and she would succeed . swaggering : sundee spaulding , 25 , could hardly contain her delight at being allowed to walk free from the same court where she had promised to mend her ways when notching up one of her previous 100 crimes . ` i do see a vast change where she has gained an attitude where she wants to address the issues that she has . ` the evidence for this is that she gave a negative reading for drugs when she was arrested . ' judge hagen backed the plea and handed spaulding a ` strict ' community order with numerous conditions attached including attending the eden house project . she was also given a 12-month community order , a 12-month supervision order and a six month drugs rehabilitation order . spaulding also ordered to abide by a two month curfew from 8pm to 7am . judge hagen has previously been criticised for declining to send serious offenders to jail . last year she refused to send prolific burglar jason reed to jail - before he went on to steal from 22 more homes . she then cut his jail term , after he was finally imprisoned . in 2010 she failed to send carer jane hoy to prison for stealing from one of her patients - despite describing her offence as a ` gross breach of trust targeting a vulnerable victim ' . victim lorraine andrews said she had been left ` absolutely gobsmacked ' by the decision . she was criticised in 2010 after a man who stabbed a neighbour over a text message to his girlfriend and a man with 3,400 indecent images of children both avoided custody . in february this year , jewel thief mikey rush , of withywood , bristol , was spared jail despite stealing # 20,000-worth of goods from 11 shops .	 drug addict sundee spaulding promised was given ` one last chance ' when she last appeared before the court for theft .   25-year-old had been serving 12 month suspended jail term for previous thefts when she went on shoplifting spree .   judge carol hagen told spaulding has had ` just about every sentence the court could possible give her '   judge hagen decided it was not ` in the interests of justice ' to jail the repeat offender .   mother-of-one given yet another 12-month supervision order as well as a curfew and a six month drugs rehabilitation order .

' i commenced to examine his head -lrb- as no wound near the shoulder was found -rrb- and soon passed my fingers over a large firm clot of blood situated about one inch below the superior curved line of the occipital bone , ' dr leale reported . ` the coagula i easily removed and passed the little finger of my left hand through the perfectly smooth opening made by the ball , and found that it had entered the encephalon . ' dr leale 's long-lost report also states that he immediately ` sent a gentleman for brandy and water , ' and that he found the great emancipator ` in a state of general paralysis . ' he describes : ` his eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition , while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous . ' a researcher for the papers of abraham lincoln , helena iles papaioannou , found it among correspondence of the u.s. surgeon general from april 1865 , filed under ` l' for leale . ` what 's fascinating about this report is its immediacy and its clinical , just-the-facts approach , ' daniel stowell , director of the papers of abraham lincoln , told the associated press . ` there 's not a lot of flowery language , not a lot of emotion . ' physicians have long debated whether mr lincoln could have lived with modern medicine . trauma treatment was virtually unknown in 1865 , and dr leale 's report illustrates ` the helplessness of the doctors , ' mr stowell said . ` he does n't say that but you can feel it . ' loss of a leader : an artist 's rendering that appeared in harper 's weekly depicts the grisly murder from another angle . help nearby : leale was some 40ft away from the president and rushed to his aide after the shooting at ford theater . dr leale wrote a report for an 1867 congressional committee investigating the assassination that referenced the earlier account , but no one had ever seen it , said mr stowell , whose group 's goal is to find every document written by or to abraham lincoln during his lifetime . at least four researchers have been painstakingly scouring boxes of documents at the national archives for more than six years . they methodically pull boxes of paper - there are millions of documents packed away and never catalogued , mr stowell said - and look for ` lincoln docs , ' as ms papaioannou called them . assassination site : ford 's theatre , located in washington , d.c. , was playing ` our american cousin ' on april 14 , 1865 . consequences : on july 7 , 1865 , three men and one woman were hanged in washington for their parts in the crime : mrs. mary surratt , lewis powell , david herold , and george atzerodt . she was assigned the surgeon general 's documents and was leafing through letters pitching inventions for better ambulances and advice about feeding soldiers onions to ward off disease when she hit dr leale 's report . ' i knew it was interesting . what we did n't know was this was novel , ' ms papaioannou said . ` we did n't know that this was new , that this was an 1865 report and that it likely had n't been seen before . ' the surgeon never spoke or wrote about his experiences again until 1909 in a speech commemorating the centennial of lincoln 's birth . the papers of abraham lincoln , administered by the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum in springfield , has found and is digitizing 90,000 documents , mr stowell said . i arrived at ford 's theatre about 8 1/4 p.m. april 14/65 and procured a seat in the dress circle about 40 feet from the president 's box . the play was then progressing and in a few minutes i saw the president , mrs lincoln , major rathbone and miss harris enter ; while proceeding to the box they were seen by the audience who cheered which was reciprocated by the president and mrs lincoln by a smile and bow . the party was preceded by an attendant who after opening the door of the box and closing it after they had all entered , took a seat nearby for himself . the theatre was well filled and the play of `` our american cousin '' progressed very pleasantly until about half past ten , when the report of a pistol was distinctly heard and about a minute after a man of low stature with black hair and eyes was seen leaping to the stage beneath , holding in his hand a drawn dagger . while descending his heel got entangled in the american flag , which was hung in front of the box , causing him to stumble when he struck the stage , but with a single bound he regained the use of his limbs and ran to the opposite side of the stage , flourishing in his hand a drawn dagger and disappearing behind the scene . i then heard cries that the ` president had been murdered , ' which were followed by those of ` kill the murderer ' ` shoot him ' etc. which came from different parts of the audience . i immediately ran to the presidents box and as soon as the door was opened was admitted and introduced to mrs. lincoln when she exclaimed several times , ' o doctor , do what you can for him , do what you can ! ' i told her we would do all that we possibly could . when i entered the box the ladies were very much excited . mr. lincoln was seated in a high backed arm-chair with his head leaning towards his right side supported by mrs. lincoln who was weeping bitterly . miss harris was near her left and behind the president . while approaching the president i sent a gentleman for brandy and another for water . when i reached the president he was in a state of general paralysis , his eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition , while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous . i placed my finger on his right radial pulse but could perceive no movement of the artery . as two gentlemen now arrived , i requested them to assist me to place him in a recumbent position , and as i held his head and shoulders , while doing this my hand came in contact with a clot of blood near his left shoulder . supposing that he had been stabbed there i asked a gentleman to cut his coat and shirt off from that part , to enable me if possible to check the hemorrhage which i supposed took place from the subclavian artery or some of its branches . before they had proceeded as far as the elbow i commenced to examine his head -lrb- as no wound near the shoulder was found -rrb- and soon passed my fingers over a large firm clot of blood situated about one inch below the superior curved line of the occipital bone . the coagula i easily removed and passed the little finger of my left hand through the perfectly smooth opening made by the ball , and found that it had entered the encephalon . as soon as i removed my finger a slight oozing of blood followed and his breathing became more regular and less stertorous . the brandy and water now arrived and a small quantity was placed in his mouth , which passed into his stomach where it was retained . dr. c. f. taft and dr. a. f. a. king now arrived and after a moments consultation we agreed to have him removed to the nearest house , which we immediately did , the above named with others assisting . when we arrived at the door of the box , the passage was found to be densely crowded by those who were rushing towards that part of the theatre . i called out twice ` guards clear the passage , ' which was so soon done that we proceeded without a moments delay with the president and were not in the slightest interrupted until he was placed in bed in the house of mr peterson , opposite the theatre , in less than 20 minutes from the time he was assassinated . for the full report , please visit the papers of abraham lincoln here .	 report written by doctor who helped lincoln hours after the president 's death in 1865 .   dr charles leale , 23 , was just six weeks into his practice and was 40ft away from lincoln during performance of ` our american cousin '   21-page report details medical procedures used in attempt to save president 's life .

229	by . daily mail reporter . updated : . 10:10 est , 11 october 2011 . wal-mart stores inc and facebook unveiled a partnership on tuesday to help the world 's largest retailer connect customers with its local stores . wal-mart launched my local walmart , a page that lets the retailer 's roughly nine million facebook fans follow what is happening at stores in their neighborhoods . the effort covers about 3,500 wal-mart outlets and will send alerts to the company 's facebook fans about new products and discounts , the companies said . like it ? walmart launched ` my local walmart ' with facebook on tuesday , hoping that new social networking push will help them reverse nine quarters of revenue declines . ` with early walmarts , customers would walk in and ask the store manager to get a product , ' said stephen quinn , chief marketing officer of wal-mart . ` this is going to allow this kind of communication at national scale . stores become more relevant on a local level because of interaction with customers . ' wal-mart is stepping up investments in both e-commerce and social networking to try to compete more effectively with internet rivals led by amazon.com . facebook fans of wal-mart who sign up to the new page will get about two messages a week from their local store at first , quinn added . alerts may be triggered by local events such as a high school football game or weather , he said . ' a national message is sometimes not relevant , ' quinn said . ` we can now say we have sunscreen in the south and snow boots in the north . ' my local walmart also will have a role in this year 's holiday shopping season , especially on the day after thanksgiving when shoppers line up early for deals , he added . half of adults on facebook currently follow a brand as part of their profile . walmart has well over 9million followers . shoppers will be able to download maps of their local store from my local walmart , showing them where specific merchandise will be in their store . ` it 's impossible to put out a generic map , ' quinn said . ` this allows us to put out store maps for each local store .

230	by . kerry mcqueeney . updated : . 02:37 est , 16 february 2012 . a grocer claims supermarket staff banned him from his local store after he bought vegetable oil to use as fuel in his vehicle . chris waites says managers at his local tesco in didcot , oxfordshire , told him it was illegal for him to buy vegetable oil and use it as fuel in his delivery van . he claims the ban came after he purchased six five-litre bottles of vegetable oil to fill up the van he uses for his grocery business . dispute : supermarket bosses at the didcot branch -lrb- pictured -rrb- said they were ` investigating ' the matter . the transit van has been adapted to run on vegetable oil . it is not thought to be illegal to purchase vegetable oil to be used as bio fuel . mr waites said he clashed with staff at the store when he bought the bottles of oil and told them what he was using it for . tesco said it was investigating the matter and stressed that it does not prevent customers from buying products . he said when he returned to the supermarket on saturday to buy other items , he was told he was no longer welcome because using vegetable oil to run a vehicle was a criminal activity . he said : ' a member of staff told me in front of lots of other customers that i was no longer welcome at the store because i had been using vegetable oil illegally for my van . criminal offence ? the grocer claimed staff told him it was illegal to buy vegetable oil to use as fuel . ` using vegetable oil to run a vehicle is not illegal and it was embarrassing to be branded a criminal in this way in front of lots of other shoppers . ` normally we get given the vegetable oil free from pubs and restaurants but on this occasion i 'd gone to tesco . ` we deliver groceries to people in rural areas but i ca n't imagine tesco are trying to stop me from using my van because they feel threatened by the competition . ' mr waites said he had been a customer at the store for seven years and he was not aware of any other reason why he was being banned . he added : ` the day before i bought the oil i went to customer services because the store had overcharged me for a pack of pg tips . i got a refund but that was all sorted out and i ca n't believe tesco are being so petty . ' mr waites , who lives with wife miriam , 27 , said his 2.5-litre ford transit van had been adapted to run on vegetable oil . he added : ' i have been running the van this way for about six years and it 's perfectly legal . the government actually gives you a tax-free allowance every year if you use vegetable oil . we cover about 50 miles a day travelling around south oxfordshire and use about 2,300 litres a year . ' a litre of diesel now costs over # 1.40 at the pumps whereas a litre of vegetable oil costs about 90p . ' in recent years companies have provided drivers with a source of greener , cheaper motoring by turning oil used for frying chips into biodiesel . after collecting drums of used oil from cafis and takeaways , firms refine the liquid into a fuel suitable for most diesel engines . but specially adapted engines , like the one in mr waites 's van , can run on unrefined vegetable oil . biodiesel emits much less unburned hydrocarbons , carbon monoxide and other harmful substances , and does not produce the noxious black smoke associated with mineral diesel . however , biodiesel is not a lover of cold mornings and may cause start-up problems at very low temperatures . tesco spokesman david nieberg said : ` our stores are there to serve customers , not prevent them from shopping . ` we 'd like to stress we do not ban customers for simply buying vegetable oil -- even if it is to put in a vehicle . we are speaking to mr waites to resolve the issue . '	 customer claimed he was banned from his local store .   supermarket bosses told him it was ` against the law ' to buy vegetable oil for fuel .   tesco said it was ` investigating ' the matter .

' damning find : the investigation into geisler 's relief , was obtained by navy times via a freedom of information act request . on one occasion , . the party-goers jumped onboard a boat belonging to a belgian couple who . lived in the complex , leaving a mess of drink stains , cigarette butts . and rubbish . ` we are in a region where our . behavior is repeatedly stressed to us from the minute we get off the . plane , ' one officer , who left the party disgusted after seeing geisler . swim naked , told investigators in a sworn statement . ` but . seeing these rules openly violated by the chain of command makes me . wonder how seriously it is taken , ' he said reported the navy times . the parties did not slip completely . under the radar - neighbours , and other officers complained , saying such . behavior was counter to the prevailing culture in the islamic country . geisler was at the centre of the parties - he . emailed junior officers from his government computer account to help arrange . parties and texted them on his official blackberry organsing to meet up at clubs . and bars . but geisler 's hedonistic lifestyle took a . toll on his reputation among other colleagues who did not attend the . parties , but heard the stories - officers began to feel that an . ` in-crowd ' had formed around him and began to think he was only picking . his fellow party goers for trips abroad and awards . u.s. navy bahrain : geisler 's firing prompted major changes for the navy in the country - 5th fleet prohibited all drinking on - and off-base from midnight until 6 a.m. , every day of the week . staff who knew of the wild parties were too worried about their position if they reported geisler 's indiscretions - it was made more tricky as one staff officer said that both the legal officer and the command 's equal opportunity manager frequently attended the parties . if he came forward , one officer . said , his expectation was : ' i will get crushed . ' once a complaint was finally made via . email to rear adm. charles gaouette , deputy commander of naval forces . central command , events changed very quickly . five months after the skinny dipping . party , geisler was relieved in mid-october by vice adm. mark fox , 5th . fleet commander , becoming the 19th of 22 cos fired in 2011 . unwelcome : capt. david geisler 's behaviour in bahrain , was not well received - neighbours , and other officers complained , saying such behavior was counter to the prevailing culture in the islamic country . geisler received nonjudicial punishment for failure to obey regulations and for conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and three other officers were also reprimanded . two weeks after his removal , the 5th fleet prohibited all drinking on - and off-base from midnight until 6 a.m. , every day of the week - the new rules includes bars , restaurants , and public spaces , tellingly including canals . the damage the parties and raucous behavior caused to relations in bahrain is unclear . fifth fleet is ` unaware of any host-nation impact ' from the indecent parties , lt. rebecca rebarich , a spokeswoman for the fleet , said in an emailed reply to questions from the navy times . geisler has been reassigned to naval . surface force atlantic in norfolk , va. , according to navy personnel . command . he did not respond to repeated calls and email requests for . comment .	 capt. david geisler was fired as a commodore in bahrain late last year .   navy said he was fired because there was a ` loss of confidence ' in him , but new report suggests he was at the centre of alcohol-fuelled parties .

' lyn hill-tout , chief executive of the trust , said : ` we are hopeful that the outcome of this review by monitor will be that decisions are made about which services are to be provided at stafford and cannock chase hospitals . ` reviews of the trust over the last few years and the changes to the way healthcare has begun to be provided nationally have led to a growing feeling of uncertainty about the future of the two hospitals . ` we welcome monitor working with our commissioners so that clear decisions are taken which ensure that the healthcare needs of local people are met in a truly sustainable way . we will , of course , give monitor every support and will cooperate fully with their review team . ' foundation trust network director of strategy and communications saffron cordery said : ` the foundation trust network supports all efforts to improve quality and sustainability of services for patients in staffordshire and welcome this recognition of the value of resolving issues in the healthcare economy at a regional level . ` the health service continues to be under enormous financial pressure and many changes will have to be made - not just in staffordshire . ` we need to find different ways of commissioning and delivering the services needed to deal with changing patterns of healthcare . ' a department of health spokeswoman said : ` despite improvements , mid staffordshire is still facing serious financial challenges . ` this puts at risk its work on improving services for patients . it is important that valued local services are sustainable and able to continue providing high quality treatment and advice for patients . ` by starting to explore options with the trust and local nhs professionals now , monitor is ensuring that there would be no delay if they need to take action next year to protect the local services that patients need and use . '	 the mid staffordshire nhs foundation trust is at the centre of an # 11million inquiry .   financial overhaul has been demanded by independent regulator monitor .   fears it could become the second nhs trust to be put into special administration .   south london healthcare trust was put under the charge of a special administrator in june .

' he called sergeant paul colgan , who used a knife to cut a three-inch hole in the bag , confirming a body was inside and alerting the murder squad . sgt colgan said the heavy-duty bag concealed the smell of the decomposing body but once the hole was made the ` smell became more than apparent ' . when mr williams 's sensitive job was discovered , detectives from the force 's counter terrorism command were informed . the inquest , in westminster , heard details of the spy 's life , including how he went to university aged just 16 , joining the university of bangor 's computer science department . it was also told how the successful cyclist and fell runner followed the arts and fashion and had a # 20,000 collection of women 's designer clothing in his wardrobe . mrs subbe said her brother was ` the most scrupulous risk-assessor ' she had ever known . she said he would meticulously check his equipment before rock climbing , cycling and fell running . she added that her brother never told her he was being followed or felt threatened , saying : ` i can not think as to why anybody would want to harm him . ' the inquest , which is expected to last eight days , continues . being tracked ? mr williams is caught on cctv in holland park on august 14 , 2010 , just over a week before his naked and decomposing body was found locked in a bag in his pimlico flat . suspicions : mr williams ' body is taken out of his flat . relatives believe a third party was either present when gareth williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence . interests : mr williams was also a successful cyclist and fell runner with a passion for the arts , cinema , books and fashion , with a # 20,000 clothing collection in his wardrobe .	 gareth williams was extremely ` security conscious ' and would not have let strangers inside his flat .   he may have been considering leaving the security services to start up his own business .   detectives say criminal charges are still a possibility , despite no suspects .   four intelligence .   agents give evidence behind anonymity screens to avoid ` real risk of .   harm ' to national security and international relations .   mr williams wanted to escape the ` rat race ' of the capital and was frustrated that mi6 had been dragging its feet over the move .   the spy was extremely conscientious and his family said he would never let anyone into his flat apart from them .   mi6 was accused of failing to raise the alarm when he missed a key meeting one week before his body was found .   a sergeant described the moment he cut open the red north face holdall and found the body of mr williams curled up inside .   a constable who discovered the bag and raised the alarm noticed underwear neatly folded on a nearby bed and a woman 's wig hanging on a chair . the death of mr williams in august 2010 triggered a painstaking investigation , worldwide media frenzy and a raft of conspiracy theories .

' miss jowell conceded it may not be . possible to bring small children to all events . but she insisted that . locog was ` focused on finding a solution ' to the problem immediately . rather than in april , when a fresh wave of ticket sales begins . the suggestion of a u-turn comes as . the independent equality and human rights commission warned that new . parents who wanted to take their babies to the games could have a case . for sex discrimination if they were prevented -- because the rules were . likely to affect more women than men . since news of the ticket policy . emerged , many parents have told on social networking and parenting . websites of their misery at being unable to attend events . the problem particularly affects those . who live outside london and the south east , where a visit could . potentially involve an overnight trip , making childcare difficult . one mother said : ` i live in shropshire and had planned to go with my two children and husband . ` i have fallen pregnant since i bought . the tickets but as i want to breast-feed -- unless i can bring the baby . we just wo n't be able to go . it 's ridiculous . ' at lord 's cricket matches , babies and toddlers under three go in for free , while wimbledon recommends babies are not taken . children under five are allowed in without a ticket -- but may not enter centre court or the other show courts . at twickenham stadium , children under . two do not require a ticket but must be securely strapped to an adult . sitting in the lower tier of the stands . one woman on mumsnet said she is likely to miss out on the olympics as a result of the policy . she said ` it does feel like discrimination ' , adding she has four tickets for sailing . ` we will apparently need another ticket for a baby not even born yet and certainly not conceived when we bid for tickets . ' she said she would bid for another ticket but did not hold out much hope . ` if i can not get another ticket , then it looks as though the baby wo n't be able to go and so neither will i. outrage on mumsnet : ` if i can not get another ticket , then it looks as though the baby wo n't be able to go and so neither will i ' ' i normally keep well clear from the . breast v bottle discussions , but this does feel like discrimination . against those people who are breastfeeding . ` and those unable/unwilling to leave a very small baby in the care of someone else . ' another woman said she objected to the . fact that she needed ` to get another ticket that in all probability . wo n't exist ... stopping me and potentially my family from going . ` it . will be a while until i know if i can even get another ticket -lrb- april , . provided the website is working by then -rrb- , regardless of the cost , and . probably too late by then to be able to re-sell any tickets we are . subsequently unable to use . ' another ` fuming ' pregnant woman wrote on mumsnet : ` i 'm shocked by the conversation i just had with the london 2012 ticketing people . ` my . husband and i were lucky enough to get tickets to the horse jumping in . august . our baby is due 2 june , so was inquiring about what i need to do . about tickets for the new baby . ` they said everyone needs a ticket - fine . children 's tickets are # 1 - fine . ` but there are no children 's tickets for the horse jumping so i have to pay # 95 to have a three-month-old in a sling ! ` they said the only alternative was to re-sell my ticket or give it to someone else . ' anyone wishing to re-sell their tickets must submit their request to olympic organisers by a february 3 deadline . a second wave of ticket re-sales will occur in april . according . to 2012 organisers , it possible for people to give tickets away to . friends and family as long as they are not sold on the open market .	 fury at rule to ban babies without valid tickets .   olympics organisers agree to ` look again ' at policy .

' he said . the planes are stationed at five other bases besides virginia : joint base elmendorf-richardson , alaska ; joint base pearl harbor-hickam , hawaii ; nellis air force base , nevada ; holloman air force base , new mexico ; and tyndall air force base , florida .	 military has almost 190 of the craft , classed as the most advanced at the country 's disposal .   pilots report dizziness and blackouts while flying .   airforce general insists there is no problem and that the fighter strikes fear into hearts ' of america 's enemies .

' the doctors and their colleagues , believed to be a guide and two interpreters , were employed by a non-profit humanitarian organisation , the swiss-based medair , and had been working to help to treat malnourished children . abdul maroof rasikh , spokesman for badakhshan province 's governor , said it was unclear who kidnapped them . a massive search operation involving police , military and volunteers was underway , he said , but the area was rugged and ` very difficult ' to travel in . it is the same area where british surgeon karen woo , 36 , was murdered in 2010 by militants as she returned to the capital kabul . the area is not known as a focus for afghan insurgents but is home to groups of mainly criminal gunmen . police said the aid workers had been visiting a health clinic in yawan district , where the road had been destroyed by floods . ` they were travelling by donkey . two foreign women and their afghan translators were kidnapped and we have started a search operation , ' said lal mohammad ahmadzai , police spokesman for northern afghanistan . british aid worker khalil dale , 60 , was kidnapped and killed in neighbouring pakistan earlier this year . nato-led forces said they had no information on the kidnapping , while ngos operating in the area declined to comment citing the sensitivity of the issue . the kidnapping of foreigners has become relatively common in parts of afghanistan since u.s.-backed afghan forces toppled the former taliban government in 2001 , sparking a decade-long anti-insurgent war . concerns for the hostages ' safety are likely to be high after another western aid worker , captured in neighbouring pakistan , was executed last month . khalil dale , 60 , was taken at gunpoint while working with the british red cross in january . he was found beheaded and riddled with bullets on april 28 , in an orchard in the south-west city of quetta . the pakistani taliban claimed responsibility and along with the body was a note addressed to the chief of police , which read : ` this is the body of khalil who we have slaughtered for not paying a ransom amount . ' and in october 2010 , british aid , worker linda norgrove died in a botched rescue attempt after she was taken hostage in kunar province . it was originally reported that the 36-year-old , from the western isles , had died at the hands of her captors but an investigation later revealed she was in fact killed by a grenade thrown by the u.s.-led team of would-be rescuers . earlier this month a video was posted on jihadist websites in which american captive warren weinstein is seen urging barack obama to meet al qaeda 's demands and set him free . mr weinstein , 70 , was working for a development consultancy in pakistan , where was taken from his house in the city of lahore last august .	 women snatched while travelling on horseback .   employed by not-for-profit swiss organisation .   massive search underway .   area is home to groups of criminal gunmen .

' -lsb- the instructor -rsb- knew how bad i wanted to jump . ' laverne , who admits to seeking out excitement , surprised her family when she announced that she wanted to jump out of a plane to celebrate entering her ninth decade . ` they thought i was very brave , ' laverne , from oakdale , california , told cbs . ` but , it 's just something i 've wanted to do for a long time . ' and she fulfilled her wish at the sky dive lodi parachute center last may . however the dive itself , which was all caught on camera then posted on youtube by laverne 's sister , did not go as smoothly as expected . after her harness came loose laverne was left precariously dangling from her instructor as she hurtled towards the ground at 125mph . furthermore , the daredevil could not see what was happening as her shirt flew up covering her face . ` the upper harness came off , you know . just slipped down , it was just the lower harness , is all i had .

' the federal aviation administration confirmed it is now investigating what went wrong with the dive . at the end of the video the woman can be seen on the ground apparently uninjured but is seen being given some careful attention . even the instructor is traumatised and has to be consoled by a colleague . parachute jump : the woman , 80 , and her tandem diver leap from the plane over california . shortly after leaving the aircraft , they would have been travelling at 125mph . descent : the separate parachute jumper videoing the jump captures the moment they tumble out of the aircraft . descent : they plummet towards the ground - but problems quickly start as the woman 's harness slips . difficulties : the instructor clings onto the woman 's harness as they get into trouble . freezing : the woman 's back is completely exposed to the elements and rushing wind as her jacket top flies up during the fall . difficulties : the tandem skydivers hold on to each other as they fall towards the sun-scorched californian earth . topple : rather than being strapped together , the two jumpers ' legs are both pointing in different directions . comforting : the instructor , left , and the woman jumper , 80 , right , are helped after they made a successful and safe-landing in california . watch interview here . video : the woman leaps two minutes into the footage .	 laverne everett became an internet sensation after a video was posted of her nightmare sky-dive .   the video shows how the pensioner nearly falls out of her harness as it comes loose while hurtling towards ground at 125mph .

' ravi subramanian , head of unison in the west midlands told the guardian that the birmingham and sandwell hospital trust was being forced to find # 125m worth of savings over the next five years . he added : ` now the hospital is making moves to deliver healthcare on the cheap , by using people on work experience to help with patient care . patients and staff will rightly be very worried about the standard of patient care as this scheme is rolled out . ' the nhs trust defended the ` ward service assistants ' scheme , saying the participants were all crb checked and underwent two weeks of training at sandwell college before carrying out basic tasks . these included making hot and cold drinks for patients and helping to feed them if necessary , as well as collecting medication from the hospital pharmacy to give nurses more time on the wards . pilot : six participants helped nurses on wards at sandwell hospital . assistant director of nursing linda pascall added : ` we have really appreciated the support the ward service assistants have given to the wards . ` their positive attitude has made this venture a success and we hope to be able to continue to work with our jobcentre plus partners to offer this scheme which has proven to have genuine benefits for our local community .

272	by . becky barrow and james chapman . updated : . 04:35 est , 21 june 2011 . women hit hardest by controversial changes to the state pension age will be given a lifeline , ministers confirmed last night . iain duncan smith , the work and pensions secretary , told mps that ` transitional arrangements ' will be made to help those most affected . his apparent concession comes after the daily mail repeatedly highlighted how women in their late 50s would be affected more than any other group by cost-saving increases in the pension age . concessions ... but iain duncan smith failed to say exactly what will be done to help or how many women will benefit . only yesterday it emerged that senior lib dem ministers told the treasury that some kind of compromise was ` inevitable ' to soften the blow . mr duncan smith repeatedly signalled that concessions will be made . he also said he would ` happily look at transitional arrangements . ' but he failed to say exactly what will be done to help or how many women will benefit . at present , a woman can start receiving her state pension at the age of 60 years and seven months . a man must wait until he is 65 . under the changes , the age will reach 65 for both men and women in november 2018 -- and will rise to 66 by april 2020 . devastated : barbara bates will be forced to work for an extra two years . mp yesterday waved through the change when the pensions bill received its second reading after the government offered to hold talks with critics about how the change would be introduced . it was given a second reading by 302 votes to 232 , government majority 70 . women are the biggest losers from the changes , with around 2.6 million having to wait longer before their pension begins to be paid . but mr duncan smith insisted that it would affect only a ` relatively small number of women ' and that delay would cost the taxpayer # 10 billion . he offered to hold ` discussions ' with mps over the ` transitional arrangements ' , but maintained : ` we stand by the need for men and women 's state pension ages to equalise in 2018 . ` and both will rise together so the state pension age reaches 66 in 2020 . this bill will go forward on that basis . ` if we delayed the move to 66 until 2022 it would cost the taxpayer # 10 billion - an unfair financial burden borne disproportionately by the next generation . ' of the total , around 500,000 will have to wait more than a year and 33,000 will have to wait exactly two years . there is broad agreement on the need to equalise and raise state pension ages , which were first set in 1926 . but mps on all sides say it is unfair that one particular group of women will be hit so hard , losing as much as # 15,000 each . dame anne begg , labour chairman of the work and pensions select committee , even warned that the proposals risked creating a ` new poor ' of women forced on to benefits until they reach the new state pension age . former conservative justice spokesman eleanor laing urged the government to think again . ` no one can object to the equalisation of pension ages when we 're fighting so hard on other areas of equality , ' she told mr duncan smith . ` you are absolutely right to do what you 're doing . ` but will you recognise that there is a particular group of women -- some 300,000 of them -- born in 1954 for whom the transition arrangements are rather more difficult than they are for any other group of society ? will you look at other ways of helping that particular group of women ? ' liberal democrat work and pensions spokesman jenny willott said the legislation currently did not ` pass the fairness test ' . but she insisted it was worth backing and that changes could be made to improve it . former labour welfare minister frank field said the coalition was right to seek to make savings . he suggested pension age increases for both men and women after 2020 could be accelerated slightly to pay for easing the burden on women in their late 50s now . as reported in yesterday 's mail . this idea was also raised by government sources last night . it could cause resentment , but most pension experts agree ten years ' notice of relatively minor changes would be sufficient . in his response , mr duncan smith said he would ` happily look at transitional arrangements ' . it is not clear , however , whether these will apply to the 33,000 biggest losers , or the larger number of 500,000 women . dr ros altmann , director general of saga , said : ` the ideal solution would be to revise the timetable . tinkering is better than nothing but we need to see the detail . ' campaigners yesterday warned the government could face a legal battle if changes were not made . experts raised the threat of a judicial review because it is ` unreasonable ' to force through such high-speed changes to women 's state pension age . labour 's pensions spokesman rachel reeves accused the government of ` clearly breaching ' its coalition agreement . that document said the state pension age would not be increased ` sooner than 2020 for women ' . in fact , it is starting to rise in 2018 . but tory richard drax accused labour of failing to deal with the pensions ' crisis when in power . he said : ` it has long been apparent that something had to give . our national longevity has increased by an average of ten years since the 1970s . ' quentin letts : yesterday in parliament . for decades we have been told that women must be treated equally . many a bra was burned to a frilly crisp . germaine greer cabbaged away about little else for the best part of 40 -lrb- or was it 50 ? -rrb- years . chaps had their ears boxed for gawping at miss world and domestic rolling pins were wielded like johannesburg sjamboks . mrs letts even took up diy . now , hooray , we ardent feminists have something long overdue to celebrate . the state pension age for men and women is to be made equal . female pensioners will no longer be given preferential terms . hard stare : yvette cooper did n't much like iain duncan smith 's plans for pension reform . equality for all ! strike up the internationale ! but what happens ? politicians are in uproar , talking about how ` unfair ' it all is . you ca n't win . iain duncan smith , pensions secretary , played things sotto when he came to the commons yesterday afternoon . he opened the chamber 's doors to find row upon row of crosspatches sitting there , steaming like a kitchen of chinese saucepans . arms were crossed . fingers were being drummed . uh-oh . the house had a mood on . mr duncan smith has never been one of life 's shouters -- it makes him cough -- so he did not try to pick a fight . he did try one or two tiny jokes but soon dropped that tactic . wise . as many an errant man has been told , ` do n't think you can laugh me out of it -- it is n't funny ! ' mr duncan smith faced the likes of labour mps fiona mactaggart -lrb- slough -rrb- , joan walley -lrb- stoke on trent n -rrb- and frontbenchers rachel reeves and yvette cooper . the editorial board at spare rib magazine was scarcely more formidable . ids 's reluctance to become openly hostile was understandable . even neanderthal man knew when not to risk life and limb . all but the most novice circus tamers resist baiting a lioness when her tail is twitching . shadow home secretary miss cooper was there simply out of interest , or maybe peevishness , for pensions is no longer her realm . she gave mr duncan smith one of those chilling , old-fashioned stares , the like of which no chap can ever fully ignore . you may know the type of glare . it is like being bored into by a black and decker . miss reeves stepped up to the despatch box repeatedly to give it an imperious whack . mr duncan smith took her interventions . she did not like what he told her , but at least he had given vent to her fury . the reeves voice is a forceful instrument . put a bag over your head and she could be twin sister of the late and masterly bernard bresslaw . as a former opposition leader , mr duncan smith has a certain insurance policy . he is coated by that special varnish westminster reserves for those who have failed in lofty office . lack of success makes them popular . and so mr duncan smith found some of his critics opening their sallies with little preambles about what an admirable fellow he usually was . labour 's rachel reeves , left , and fiona mactaggart were among the mps that mr duncan smith had to face . thanks to his tact , the house did not ignite . indeed , when his shadow , liam byrne , later spoke from the despatch box , there may have been increased warmth towards the secretary of state . mr byrne was dismally partisan and seemed barely to grasp the necessity of pensions change . as ids explained , longevity has made a nonsense of the sums . when the state pension system started , it was on a ratio of nine people working to every pensioner . this is now three to one , and will soon be two to one . it 's actually pretty amazing that no government has seized the issue beforehand . mr duncan smith said that ` responsible government is not always easy government ' and claimed that ` we will stay the course ' . yet he also said that he did ` not rule out a discussion ' about how to help women born in 1954 , who may be unlucky in the way the adjustments are made . that sounds as though a cop-out is being prepared . ca n't we just send them some flowers instead and promise to take them to the pictures ?	 pensions bill given a second reading by 302 votes to 232 , a government majority 70 .

' the teacher responds that she was not aware of mr obama being a bully . she begins to raise her voice telling the student not to make ` degrading ' comments . the student tries to reply : ` if you 're going to talk -lsb- about -rsb- romney ... ' but he is interrupted by the teacher , who starts shouting . ` uh-uh ! stop ! stop ! no ! because there 's no comparison . he -lsb- mr romney -rsb- is running for president . obama is the president . ' the student , not satisfied with that answer , went on to say : ` if you 're going to talk trash about one side , you got ta talk trash about the other . ' however , the teacher disagreed . she said , ` let me tell you this : you 've got to realize this man is wanting to be what obama already is , ok ? ' she continues , screaming : ` that 's disrespect ! that 's disrespect ! ' ` stop ! no ! ' : when a student asked whether obama was ever a bully , the teacher angrily demanded that the student say nothing negative about him . the student contends that the teacher is the one being disrespectful - to mr romney . this infuriated the teacher . she insists that the student follow her rule . the teacher cried out : ` you will not disrespect the president of the united states ! ' the student retorted : ` i 'll say what i want . ' she angrily counters : ` not about him you wo n't . ' as the exchange went on , the student told the teacher that he had different beliefs than her and when he asked a question about mr obama and bullying , the teacher got ` defensive ' and ` freaked out . ' ` no comparison ' : when the student asked why it was ok to discuss mitt romney , the teacher said he should be treated differently as a candidate . then he tries to reason with the teacher that plenty of people have talked badly about president george w. bush . the teacher answered that the student needed to stop slandering the current president because ` people were arrested for saying rather poor things about bush . ' unconvinced , the student offers his viewpoint : ` you would have to say some pretty f *** ed up crap ... to be arrested . ` they can not take away your right to have your opinion or your freedom of speech . they ca n't take that away ... unless you threaten the president .

' lamb , 23 , of baldovie terrace , dundee , previously admitted a charge of theft by housebreaking . he and another man broke into a flat occupied by william wallace in whitfield avenue , dundee , between february 11 and 12 last year . they stole a television , an xbox console and accessories , ornaments and a train set . bizarrely , the pair also stole a toilet seat in the raid . in a report submitted to dundee sheriff court outlining the breach of his order , social workers said : ` it would appear that mr lamb has not afforded his orders due priority which is evidenced by his continued failures to attend . ` his most recent evidence to cover absences was an appearance on tv , namely the jeremy kyle show . ` he reports that he now has access to his children which he contributes to his recent appearance on the jeremy kyle show . ` there has been no other substantial changes in his circumstances that should preclude him from attending . ` mr lamb again has not afforded his order due priority . ` this despite having been granted extensive periods of time in which to submit evidence . ` no commitment to order ' : lamb said he was a ` really nervous ' during the filming of the jeremy kyle show . the episode he appears in has not yet aired . ` even when evidence has been submitted and accepted ' i have no option but to call in to question his commitment to his order given the most recent evidence used was an appearance on the jeremy kyle show . ` i therefore have no alternative but to request that court consider revoking said order in view to imposing an alternative disposal . ' lamb would have faced a jail sentence when he appeared in court for sentence today , but he failed to attend court at 9.30 am . sheriff tom hughes granted a warrant for his arrest . lamb then turned up at court at 10.40 am , but was told his case could not be recalled . outside court , lamb said he had been transported to and from the filming of the show by taxi and had been put up in a hotel by producers . he said : ` i was n't that good , i was really nervous . it was a good experience though . ` i watch the jeremy kyle show on the telly , so i thought i 'd phone them . ` i was trying to get access through the lawyers , but i thought i 'd try this instead . ' a spokeswoman for the jeremy kyle show said the episode lamb was involved in has not yet been aired .	 alister lamb convicted of stealing toilet seat from flat .   given 200 hours community service , but only did one .   said he skipped appointments due to filming on show .   was due to be jailed today ... but missed his hearing .

' though there is little hope of identifying the young man who lost it , mr wunderlich said forensic experts may be able to discern his nationality and whether the arm was , as mr wunderlich suspects , torn from his body by a bullet or artillery round . ` being able to put the story of this unknown person before this country is very important to us , ' mr wunderlich said . ` his remains will tell a story that will relate us back to his sacrifice . this was what they gave for what they believed . if done properly , it 's a very poignant story . ' the unidentified farmer who found the limb put it in a barrel of brine , according to thomas mcgrath 's 1997 book , maryland september : true stories from the antietam campaign . the farmer reportedly gave it to a boonsboro physician , who is said to have more permanently preserved it with embalming fluid . bloody , bloody : the battle of antietam took place across a bridge in western maryland , and is considered the bloodiest one-day battle in american history . casualties : bodies await burial in front of dunker church antietam . the battle was the bloodiest day in american history with over 20,000 casualties . the arm eventually ended up in a private museum that was sold in the 1960s to john g. ray jr. . after ray died in 2001 , his widow had the museum 's contents sold at an auction , according to battlefield historian ted alexander . alexander grew up nearby and remembers seeing the arm on display . ` it was quite an attraction , ' he said . ` it was macabre and something to see as kid . ' the arm 's owner was probably a small man less than 20 years old , said william gardner , a former marshall university forensic medicine instructor who examined it in march . all dead : the bodies of confederate soldiers killed during the battle of antietam lie along hagerstown pike . since the elbow joint is undamaged , with no surgical saw marks , the arm was likely removed somewhere between the shoulder and elbow , he said . the forearm skin and tendons appear to have been violently twisted . more than 23,000 soldiers were killed , wounded , or missing after the 12-hour battle of antietam , called the bloodiest one-day battle in american history . it took place on september 17 , 1862 across rural fields in western maryland . it was the first invasion of the north by confederate general robert e. lee and his army , the army of northern virginia . president abraham lincoln , speaking two days before the battle , gave the union his blessing , saying : ` god bless you , and all with you . destroy the rebel army if possible . ' the battlefield 's history and geography offer clues about how a solitary arm could end up buried in a farm field . ` that entire battle took place in people 's fields , their yards , ' mr gardner said . the pivotal clash on september 17 , 1862 , left more than 23,000 soldiers dead , wounded or missing in the war 's bloodiest one-day battle . historians say some were blown to bits by the furious gunfire . many were buried were they fell , their shallow graves crudely marked for their eventual removal to cemeteries . some remains were never retrieved . in 2009 , a battlefield visitor found bone fragments and uniform buttons of an unknown soldier from new york state . but it 's rare to find bones still covered with skin . ` it is really an impressive piece , ' mr gardner said . museum curator lori eggleston said she 's keeping the arm dry and handling it as little as possible on the advice of experts at the mutter museum , run by the college of physicians of philadelphia . a piece of history : the national civil war medicine museum is located in frederick , maryland . healing hands : the museum documents how doctors treated soldiers on and off the battlefield 150 years ago . mr wunderlich said he hopes to have a smithsonian institution forensic anthropologist examine the arm for clues about the owner 's diet and origin . battlefield superintendent susan trail said the arm ca n't be displayed at the antietam visitor centre because the national park service generally forbids displaying human remains . but she said the medical museum could display it at the pry house , a field hospital site that the museum runs on the battlefield . ` i 'm sure the museum will do a very nice job with what they do with it , ' ms trail said . ` when you think about it , it 's pretty awful what happened here -- and you just multiply it many , many times over .

' louie was given the legs yesterday at a specialist prosthetics unit at seacroft hospital in leeds . he also lost all of the fingers on his left hand and the tips of his fingers on his right hand . louie was too young to be walking when he lost his legs . mrs jenkins said : ` when he first had them put on , he grabbed the shoes and smiled . we were so pleased . he was so comfortable in them that he fell asleep wearing them in the car on the way home . ` he looks much older now he has the legs because he is taller . he always seemed much younger than his sister francesca was at this age but now he seems more like a toddler than a baby . ` we have been told to let him lead us with how much time he wants to spend wearing the legs . if he wants to wear them for a little as half an hour a day we will let him . ` we are hoping that , if he wants to , he may be able to crawl with them . we have been told that we need to encourage him to walk wearing them in just the same way that we would any other child . ' as he gets older the money raised will also be used to buy state-of-the-art prosthetic legs at a cost of around # 7,000 per leg . julie added : ` as louie is growing it . does n't really make sense to be spending that amount of money on legs . that he will keep growing out of so he will just have the nhs ones for . now . ` as he gets older . he may want to take part in sport and we want to be able to say that we . have the money to be able to buy him the legs that he wants . ' louie back in march : he lost his legs from below the knee to meningitis . julie said that doctors praised her quick reaction spotting the first warning signs and that if she had left it any longer he may have died . ' i had bathed louie with his sister francesca as normal but throughout the night he kept waking up crying and was sick , i noticed he had a temperature so stripped him down and gave him some calpol . ` it was when i stripped him down that i noticed two small red pin prick marks . i pressed on them and they did n't go away so thought something was wrong . ` within a matter of minutes he had gone grey and floppy so i rung for an ambulance . ` as i was watching he went from having a few marks to all his legs and arms turning purple . ` they took him to airedale and treated him for meningitis , it was all a bit of a shock and it did n't really hit home until we had the results of the blood test which confirmed that he had meningococcal septicaemia . ' louis was transferred to leeds general infirmary where he was kept in intensive care for two weeks then put onto the children 's surgical ward . she added : ` the doctors said that if i had n't checked on him and spotted the rash when i did that louis probably would have died . ` the first 48 hours were touch and go and after that they gave him a 50 per cent chance of survival which gradually increased as the days went on . ' louie 's family have set up the little lamb -lrb- louie 's amazing meningitis battle -rrb- appeal to help buy equipment needed to support him as he grows . they aim to be able to have enough money to buy specialist prosthetic legs at the cost of # 7,000 per leg by the time he wants to take part in sports .	 louie 's legs were amputated below the knee when he was four months old .   his parents have already started fundraising for state-of-the-art legs louie may want when he is older .

' the warrington bombings consisted of two separate attacks -- the first in february 1993 at a gas storage facility and the second the following month in the centre of the cheshire town . in the second attack , the samaritans received a coded message wrongly stating a bomb would be detonated in liverpool . in the event , there were two blasts , in litter bins outside boots and argos , within a minute of each other causing carnage and confusion . johnathan ball was killed almost instantly and tim parry was so badly injured his parents later had to take the agonising decision to turn off his life support machine . more than 50 other victims were injured , with many suffering serious shrapnel wounds and cuts and lacerations from flying glass . bombing victims : johnathan ball , aged three , and tim parry , 12 , who were killed in the blast in warrington in 1993 . the bronze plaque was put up in 1996 alongside a water feature in part designed by local schoolchildren . mr parry , 65 , a human resources consultant , said of the thieves : ` even if they are really hard up it is without any justification . ` it really upsets me that they have disfigured something which symbolises a horror which took place in our town and has been worked on by many local youngsters . ` it leaves an awful taste in my mouth that they must have snuck in , in the middle of the night and just taken it without any regard for the people that suffered . they did not give a moments thought to the significance of what they had just stolen . it is despicable . ' his wife wendy , 54 , said : ` it 's really sad to think that anyone would even think about stealing or defacing a memorial of any kind . tim and johnathan had so much to live for and i wonder whether the person who stole the plaque ever gave them and the 56 other people injured a second thought . ` it is a sign of the times , i suppose , but there are other ways to make money without hurting those who had the misfortune to be caught up in that dreadful day . ' the bombings triggered a campaign for peace , with mr and mrs parry -- who have two other children -- working tirelessly to promote greater understanding between britain and ireland . they set up a peace centre in the town and played an active role in the peace process in northern ireland , for which mr parry was given his obe in 2004 . tragically , the parents of johnathan ball never recovered from the death of their son and they split up shortly after the bomb blast . johnathan 's father , wilf ball , 69 , died from a suspected heart attack in 2004 and his body lay undiscovered for two days . the boy 's mother , marie comerford suffered a fatal heart attack on the 16th anniversary of her son 's murder with the coroner saying she died of a broken heart . stolen : this is where the bronze memorial plaque which paid tribute to the two boys killed in the ira blast was placed . police are today hunting for the people who took it . the bronze plaque , which depicts the course of the river mersey as it flows through the borough of warrington , reads : ` the central water feature is in part a memorial to two local children who died following the terrorist bomb explosion in bridge street in 1993 . young people helped the artist with the design work . ' helen jones , labour mp for warrington north , said : ` this is a callous theft which shows no regard for the families involved or for other warrington people who were injured in the bombing . ` warrington is very proud of the way it conducted itself after the bombings and the way it did n't turn to hatred and instead worked constructively for peace . but these thieves have trashed the reputation of the town and ought to be ashamed of themselves . ' david mowat , conservative mp for warrington south , said : ` i am utterly disgusted by how low these mindless vandals have stooped . ' liz antrobus was 22 when she and her 29 year-old fiance gordon edwards were blown into the air by the blast of the second bomb . they suffered horrendous injuries and spent months in hospital but were married in 1994 in a ceremony attended by bomb victim tim parry 's mother , wendy . yesterday mrs edwards , 40 , said : ` it 's awful , absolutely awful and i do n't know why someone would want to do something like that . it is irrelevant that it happened so long ago because the events on march 20 1993 still have an impact today . ' resident amy edwards , 34 , said : ` this is one of the most shaming crimes . they are nothing but sick vultures who have no respect .

' there are enough ` quality ingredients out there ' that his california-french menu wo n't be lacking when it 's gone , slone said . as someone who goes to extreme measures to source quality meat and vegetables , he thinks animal welfare advocates could end more suffering if they 'd focus on practices at large confined animal farming operations producing beef , chicken and pork .

' but ministers insisted mr winsor was the right man for the job and would be independent both of the police and the government . cuts fury : officers jeer theresa may as she backs tom winsor 's policing reforms - which would include fitness tests and pay cuts for some officers - as she appears at the police federation annual conference last month . police minister nick herbert told the . today programme yesterday : ` the direction of travel over the last few . years has been to ensure that the inspectorate is more independent , not . just of the government ... but also of the police service itself . ' federation chairman paul mckeever was . left humiliated during the interview after he suggested senior . officers were set to resign over the appointment . but he then admitted he had spoken to . just ` one middle ranking officer ' . mr mckeever said : ` he is not just . there as a regulator , he is there to give , hopefully , sagacious advice . from a profound understanding of policing . ` he is going to be in some very . high-powered meetings on occasions where the prime minister and home . secretary say , `` tom , what do you think ? '' . ` and he is not going to know . he 's going to have to say , `` look , i 'm going to have to phone one of my advisers '' . ` that is not a position we should have somebody in who is going to be giving advice to government . ' last month thousands of police marched to protest over changes to pay , conditions and pensions . police shake-up : the appointment of tom winsor has sparked further anger among rank and file officers , just weeks after home secretary theresa may was heckled at the police federation conference . mr winsor is unpopular among officers . after he proposed cutting bonuses and introducing compulsory fitness . tests in his wide-ranging review of policing . among the more . controversial proposals in his two reports , mr winsor recommended that . police constables ' starting salaries should be cut by up to # 4,500 and . that the retirement age should be raised to 60 . controversial choice : theresa may risks angering rank and file police officers by choosing lawyer tom winsor as her preferred choice as the next chief inspector of constabulary . his . suggestion that chief constables should have the power to sack officers . were described by federation leaders as ` meddling with the very bedrock . of british policing ' . mr winsor , a lawyer and former rail . regulator , was selected following an interview process conducted by the . home secretary , theresa may . thames valley chief constable sara . thornton , and the top officer in the west midlands , chris sims , who is . also a senior figure in the association of chief police officers , are . understood to have applied but lost out . sir denis o'connor , the incumbent , is retiring this summer . before his appointment is confirmed , mr winsor faces a grilling by the house of commons home affairs committee , which has vocally criticised how his reports were compiled . bridget phillipson , labour mp for . houghton and sunderland south , said she was ` stunned ' by the decision , . saying she could not even believe reports that mr winsor had applied . matt cavanagh , of the institute for . public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- think-tank , saying he was a ` risky if not . reckless choice ' which could damage the reputation of her majesty 's . inspectorate of constabulary -lrb- hmic -rrb- . ` as well as putting the relationship . between government and the police under further strain , this provocative . choice could put at risk the growing reputation and contribution of . hmic at a crucial time . ' home office minister lynne featherstone said mrs may was ` probably ' right in recommending mr winsor for the role , but added he still had hurdles to overcome before his appointment . ` if theresa may has tom winsor as her . preferred candidate then she probably has very good reason to have him . in that way , ' she said . ` the fact that he is not from a police background is innovative and it may be brilliant . ' she . told bbc radio 4 's today programme there were ` still hurdles for tom . winsor to pass ' because he must prove to the home affairs select . committee ` he has the understanding to do the job ' . ` theresa believes he can , i believe theresa is probably , almost certainly , right . ' a home office spokesman said : ` tom . winsor has been named as the preferred candidate for the role of her . majesty 's chief inspector of constabulary . ` he will appear before the hasc before the appointment goes to the prime minister and the queen for approval . ' labour 's former home secretary david blunkett said it was ' a very odd moment ' for mr winsor to be named preferred candidate for the hmic role when the police are dealing with cuts and many officers are up in arms about his reports . mr blunkett told bbc radio 4 's world at one : ` it is almost like poking a stick through the bars of the lion 's den , at a moment when the police service are most on edge and most subject to disagreement and friction . problems : the move has prompted anger and surprise among rank-and-file officers , with much criticism focusing on mr winsor 's lack of policing experience .

' mr hollis , 42 , a pilot , and his wife , who live in chiswick , had a second son , jack , born last september . their lawyer sally moore , from law firm leigh day & co , said the couple would launch legal action against those responsible for tommy 's death . she claimed the inquest had missed questions including why no ` qualified engineer ' was supervising the workman . the inquest heard workers were under pressure from the local council , the london borough of hounslow , to complete a road-widening project in chiswick , west london , before voting began for the 2010 general election at the nearby town hall . tragedy : nanny mary gregory lies behind tommy 's buggy in chiswick , west london . a police officer removes the pram from the scene : anna martin said she was wheeling the sleeping toddler past roadworks when she heard a ` hollow ' noise followed by a ` terrible scream ' kevin elmore admitted cutting the plate and was found guilty of gross misconduct by his employer , construction firm mcnicholas , and given a written warning . he told police : ` if i could take the place of that child , then i would . ' tommy was struck by the lamppost while his nanny anna martin waited to cross the road at traffic lights . mary gregory , 62 , was also hit as she pushed her granddaughter poppy in a pram next to tommy . but mrs pygott said she would not invoke her powers to issue recommendations that councils should check the safety of lampposts because it would be expensive and ` burdensome ' . she said : ` if i had thought there was any real evidence to support manslaughter or unlawful killing as a reasonable verdict , i would have felt obliged to refer it back to the crown prosecution service or the police , and i do n't think that 's the case . ' she told the jury : ` the only conclusion i am in fact going to leave to you is that of accidental death . ` the issue of statutory liability for health and safety matters is not for this court and i do not consider that there is any evidence of a gross error that could give rise to any other conclusion , be it neglect , negligence or indeed unlawful killing .

' sir mervyn told the house of lords economic affairs committee earlier this year that the jubilee celebrations would have a similar impact on the economy to last year 's royal wedding , when the recovery stalled . ` we do expect a fall in output in the second quarter followed by a rise in the third quarter , ' he said . ` we lose an extra day 's work because of the additional bank holiday . we saw that last year and we would expect that to happen again this year . ' the bank 's chief economist spencer dale said there was similar impact with last year 's royal wedding , when growth was reduced by around 0.4 percentage points . the second successive gdp quarterly has put the uk back in recession earlier this year . the gdp forecast for the next few years suggest the economy will see slow improvement , if any . he added : ` the jubilee will have a slightly bigger effect , in part because it 's happening in june rather than april , so the ability for companies to make up that output within the quarter will be that much less . ' the gloomy prediction came as sir mervyn yesterday warned the single-currency bloc was ` tearing itself apart without any obvious solution ' . official figures released earlier this year showed that the uk had fallen into a double-dip recession . the economy shrank by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of 2012 following a 0.3 per cent decline in the fourth quarter of 2011 . a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction and it was the first since the credit crunch of 2009 . alan clarke , uk and eurozone economist at scotiabank , said : ` the economy has n't grown for six months , and the headline second quarter gdp data are unlikely to stray much above zero , even if the underlying picture is more robust . ' ben broadbent , a former goldman sachs economist who sits on the bank 's interest rate setting committee with the governor , said the extra day off would disrupt business . ` it is 5 per cent of working time , ' he said . ` maybe a little less , but it is quite a lot . '	 output fell by 0.4 per cent after extra bank holiday for the royal wedding last year . . but economy still grew .   eurozone crisis could mean economy shrinks for three successive quarters , but olympics will provide boost .

' mr clarke , who took over as tesco boss from sir terry leahy last year , denied that he had been handed a poisoned chalice , saying : ` there is n't a retailer in the uk who inherited a business with so many opportunities to grow around the world . ' cautious consumers : despite huge promotions a number of business have seen sales plummet as shoppers hold on to their money . the supermarket raised prices for a few days and were then able to say customers were making big savings . many of the items that were reduced were either sold for the same amount they were six weeks before the promotion or have only been cut by a small amount . some tesco prices that did not drop were : . tesco value unsalted butter - august 23 : # 1.10 ; august 30 : # 1.19 ; september 26 : # 1.10 . tesco value unsmoked back bacon - august 16 : # 1.44 ; august 23 : # 1.57 ; september 26 : # 1.44 ; . oxo beef stock cubes - 12 pack - august 16 : 99p ; august 27 : # 1.07 ; september 26 : 99p ; . loose carrots - august/september : 70p per kg ; one week at 80p ; september 26 : 56p ; . source : the times . tesco had pinned its hopes of growth on its ` big price drop ' , which was presented as rescuing customers from the biggest cost of living squeeze in living memory . prices would be cut on 3,000 commonly bought items , saving shoppers # 500million over a full year . but customers , who have continued to see an increase in the cost of the weekly shop , have not been convinced . richard hunter , head of equities at hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers , said the trading update was ` something of a profits warning for the year ' . retail analyst philip dorgan , of panmure gordon , said : ` this is the nightmare scenario . if -lsb- tesco 's -rsb- uk profits keep falling , then it will not be able to invest so much overseas , so long-term growth will slow and returns will significantly undershoot targets . ' but tarlok teji , retail analyst at manchester business school , said it would be wrong to believe tesco will not bounce back . in a significant change in policy , tesco said it plans to open fewer hypermarkets in the uk and to devote more cash to expanding its online business and small outlets.tesco 's fall of 2.3 per cent in sales covered the six weeks to january 7 . the weak performance was driven by food sales rather than general merchandise , clothing and electricals , which saw growth overall . online sales grew more than 14 per cent . at the same time , total international sales rose by 8.2 per cent , despite problems in the u.s. where it is to close 12 of its fresh 'n' easy outlets . to the chagrin of its boss phil clarke , tesco 's big price drop did not happen in the supermarket , but on the stock market . tesco . has been the uncontested champion of food retailing in britain for . almost two decades . its tills continued to ring , and its profits . continued to flow , throughout the financial crisis and the recession . so . city traders were simply dumbfounded when the company confessed to a . downturn in uk sales over the vital christmas period and warned that . profit growth is slowing . it 's . safe to say that having getting on for # 5billion wiped off the value of . the company was not the kind of discounting phil clarke had in mind . when he launched a promotion aimed at austerity britain last autumn . not so sweet christmas : thorntons the chocolatier also had disappointing sales during the festive season . but his big price drop campaign , which cut the cost of everyday goods across the board , was outgunned by more sophisticated marketing moves by rivals such as sainsbury and morrisons.tesco was left in the unfamiliar position of trailing its competitors . the share price fall may have felt cataclysmic , but the company is hardly on its knees . around # 1 in every # 3 spent on groceries in britain goes into one of its tills and it 's also the uk 's biggest non-food retailer , thanks to its sales of clothing , books , toys , electrical items and home products . international expansion means a large chunk of tesco sales is now made overseas , in locations including hungary and thailand . so a 2.3 per cent fall in underlying sales in just one part of the empire , the bricks-and-mortar stores in britain , does n't sound like a catastrophic failure . but the british supermarkets are still the group 's beating heart -- and until recently , this kind of lapse by tesco would have been unthinkable . under the 15-year stewardship of sir terry leahy , who stepped down in march last year , tesco was a relentless profit-making machine that appeared incapable of slipping into reverse gear . only time will tell whether phil clarke -lrb- left -rrb- . can put tesco back on top -- or whether sir terry leahy -lrb- right -rrb- should have gone . shopping somewhere else for his successor . before he hung up his grocer 's apron , leahy had more than tripled tesco 's operating profits to # 3.5 billion , by moving the business light years away from the ` pile 'em high , sell 'em cheap ' philosophy of tesco 's market-trader founder , sir jack cohen . in the process , he not only transformed . tesco , but the entire supermarket sector . in place of the depressing , fluorescent strip-lit aisles of yesteryear , he introduced sleek . out-of-town superstores and small convenience outlets in urban centres . with its clubcard , tesco was a . pioneer of loyalty points and its ` finest ' range of upmarket food lured . gourmet shoppers who in the past had spurned its shelves . the . obvious question , then , is whether tesco 's fall from grace is phil . clarke 's fault -- or whether his apparently golden inheritance was . flawed . critics in the . city have fretted for some time that the group 's ambitious foreign . growth plans -- led by clarke before he took over as group chief . executive in march -- could lead to under-investment in the core uk . business . clarke is now committed to investing more in the british . stores . others doubted . that the new man could ever hope to emulate leahy , who by the time of . his retirement had become a legend in retail circles . leahy himself . handpicked clarke to succeed him . weak christmas sales at tesco were caused by dropping food sales . both are down-to-earth liverpudlians who worked their way up to the boardroom from the shop floor . they even live on the same street in a hertfordshire village near cheshunt , where tesco has its hq . those who have accused tesco of destroying high streets with its suburban superstores and of driving independent village shops into extinction will no doubt rejoice at the thought its empire-building days may be coming to an end . no business , however great its record , has a divine right to success . virtually all companies in the end fall foul of smarter competition , or their own complacency . only time will tell whether phil clarke can put tesco back on top -- or whether sir terry leahy should have gone shopping somewhere else for his successor .	 tesco shares slumped by 15 % after it announced sales figures .   the supermarket 's shares slipped 54p to 330p .   argos sales slump by 8.8 % .   chocolatier thorntons ' sales plummet by 4.2 % .   homebase has a dismal christmas as sales fall by 2.6 % .

' ` all they 've got to do is get those guys . on to the islands for long enough to destroy the -lrb- raf -rrb- typhoon jets and . that 's the end of it . uncertain : general thompson said britain 's hold on the islands had been left vulnerable because cost-cutting meant the royal navy did not have an aircraft carrier to defend the region . vulnerable : gen thompson said if the airfield was destroyed , the only option for britain to protect the region would be to send reinforcements by sea , as margaret thatcher did in the 1980s . if the airfield was destroyed , the only option for britain to protect the region would be to send reinforcements by sea , as margaret thatcher did in the 1980s . she sent across hms invincible and hms hermes which were successful at keeping the enemy aircraft at bay , but now any task force would lack a carrier and jets . general thompson added : ` you have got to take your own air support with you and you ca n't without a carrier . end of story . ' in 1982 , the falklands task force had two aircraft carriers , but britain 's troubled and increasingly expensive plan to equip the navy with new aircraft carriers has been a well-documented struggle after ministers remain unsure about what jets will be able to launch from them . the decision to scrap the harrier fleet plan means that britain will have no carrier aircraft capability between 2011 and 2020 . the next aircraft carrier , the queen elizabeth will not be operational for another eight years . this has worrying implications for britain 's capability as tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 falklands conflict , which cost the lives of 255 british and 649 argentine servicemen . it started to intensify since 2010 , when oil exploration by british . companies off the islands raised the stakes . general thompson said he thought president cristina fernandez de . kirchner , left , was trying to force david cameron into discussing the islands sovereignty . general thompson said he believed president cristina fernandez de . kirchner was doing everything she could to force mr cameron into discussing the islands sovereignty , although the pm has refused to start with argentina unless the 3,000 islanders want them . last month downing street accused . argentina of pursuing a ` policy of confrontation ' over the islands , . after reports suggested argentina 's industry minister called for all british imports to be banned . the foreign and commonwealth office summoned an argentinian envoy to london last week to explain the proposed ban as well as what happened when the south american state 's government prevented two cruise ships from docking following a visit to the falkland islands last month . diplomatic tension : relations between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 falklands conflict , which cost the lives of 255 british and 649 argentine servicemen . britain recently deployed one of its . most modern destroyers , hms dauntless , to the region , and although it . insisted the move was merely routine , argentina met with un . secretary-general ban ki-moon and the president of the un security . council after accusing britain of ` militarising the south atlantic .

' i advanced , did my chat and my thing . when it was time to . depart i was rooted to the spot . i thought that if i walked backwards i . would fall over the furniture of one of the corgis . ` her majesty spotted my dilemma and turned her back on me to ask bobo -lsb- the queen 's dresser -rsb- to fetch some specific shoes - giving me the opportunity to withdraw . ' royal favourite : princess diana in a frederick fox hat . fox designed five hats for the queen 's tour of chile and argentina , and went on to design for the queen on numerous occasions . he was awarded a royal warrant in 1974 , as well as an lvo in the queen 's 1999 birthday honours list , making the hard work and trauma worthwhile . he has also designed headpieces for eight further royals , including the queen mother and diana , princess of wales . trusted : sir hardy amies designed for the queen from the 50s until 2002 , a year before his death - and advised frederick fox on his royal fitting . for amies ' part , despite his privileged position as one of the queen 's favourite couturiers -- he designed gowns for the queen from the early part of the 50s right up to a year before his death , in 2003 -- it was not always a bed of roses for a designer with a ferociously specific design aesthetic . eastoe tells how hardy amies , along with the queen 's other couturiers , despaired of her majesty 's tendency to pair their outfits with what they deemed to her ` ugly ' handbags that blighted their designs . she says that the queen 's formidable dresser bobo wanted to ensure no design house dominated the queen 's wardrobe , so she would outsource the design of hats , shoes and handbags to other designers which would then be matched to her outfits . hardy amies , she says , ` complained bitterly ' about ` ugly handbags ' that ruined his ` beautiful designs ' . his solution , which he claims was a popular strategy among her majesty 's dress designers , was to give the queen handbags they considered to be beautiful in the hopes she would choose to carry those instead . read more in this week 's stella magazine .	 frederick fox admits he was daunted by royal appointment .   queen 's tailor hardy amies confesses her ` ugly ' bags ruined his beautiful designs .

' ` sufferers often find that they have to be within sight of a toilet , and need easy access to water constantly ' , he added . jendle tracked down all living members of the family , now scattered throughout sweden , and managed to trace the disease back to a genetic mutation that happened some time in the 1800s . ` about half of all children in the family have suffered to a greater or lesser extent ' , he said . ` now we can use a simple blood test to find out if a person carrying the disease , and then treat it when the symptoms occur . ' cure : it was only when a swedish doctor at karlstad hospital , pictured , spotted that all sufferers were related , that he identified the cause . the condition is not usually thought of as genetic , and is usually caused by damage to the pituitary gland , either as the result of a tumour , or of a violent assault . the pituitary gland , among other things , produces the urinary hormone , vasopressin . the condition , which can be lethal in extreme cases , can be treated with hormone supplements . dr jendle has published his findings in the american journal of clinical endocrinology .	 debilitating condition had been causing suffers to urinate up to 15 litres in a day .   doctor discovers the illness was an unknown variant of diabetes insipidus .

' the barrister , addressing mr wiseman in the witness box , put to him that evidence showed that he had also charged his client # 600 for a two-hour meeting they had in a cafe and alleged that he had also put in a bill for his full hourly rate for two ` friendly ' dinners out the pair had enjoyed at mr sullivan 's expense . ` you would be wined and dined and subsequently you presented mr sullivan with a bill which charged him # 300 for each hour you were dining ... it cost him # 600 for the pleasure of your company for two hours in a cafe , ' the barrister said . mr wiseman accepted he charged for the two-hour meeting in the cafe but denied presenting a bill for the evening dinners . mr tomassi told the judge that , for mr sullivan to defend successfully the defamation claim , ` what needs to be justified is the allegation that he -lrb- mr wiseman -rrb- was charging for 13 and a half hour days when he was playing golf or away from the office for other purposes . ' picturesque : golfers flock to the dyrham park country club which is said to be one of the most outstanding courses in hertfordshire . -lrb- file photo -rrb- . jacob dean , for mr wiseman , told the court his client admits he is a member of the country club and played golf there during the time he was advising mr sullivan . however he maintains he only charged his client for two hours work on the crucial day , work which he did . ` at the heart of this case is an allegation that my client charged mr sullivan for time he was on the golf course ... if that allegation is not proved , the libel is proved , ' he told the judge . ` he accepts he played golf on novemeber 20 , starting at 11am , and two hours were charged for that day . that is the amount of work that he did for that day , ' the barrister added . mr wiseman himself , in the witness box , said he had worked as a solicitor for 40 years and dismissed the allegations against him as ` absolute nonsense . ' insisting he had charged mr sullivan reasonably , he added : ` i was full on from the moment i had instructions and dealt with a great deal of work . ' asking for a substantial award of libel damages , mr dean said : ` this libel clearly touches on the core attributes of mr wiseman 's professional reputation , accusing him of being a dishonest solicitor fraudulently charging for work which was not done .

' he added : ` is this the deal i would have preferred ? no . ' democrat congressman emanuel cleaver was more damning about the president 's capitulation to republican demands , describing the plan as a ` sugar-coated satan sandwich ' . at last : president barack obama 's deal to raise the u.s. the debt ceiling gave a brief boost to the uk stock market before an afternoon plunge . the president admitted the deal cuts domestic spending to percentage levels not seen in more than half a century , but said his biggest priority was to avert the global economic chaos that could have followed a default . conservative lawmakers , meanwhile , toasted a major defeat for the administration . house of representatives speaker john boehner , the chief republican negotiator , said : ` the white house bid to raise taxes has been shut down .

both in andhra pradesh as well as at the centre . the party was dealt a fresh blow on saturday when the cbi named the late chief minister of the state , y.s. rajasekhara reddy in a chargesheet filed before a special court in connection with the disproportionate assets case of his son , y.s. jaganmohan reddy . the investigating agency charged ysr with entering into a ` criminal conspiracy ' to allot land to two pharmaceutical companies in exchange for investing in the business empire of jagan as a quid pro quo arrangement . probe : jaganmohan reddy -lrb- left -rrb- and his father y.s. rajasekhara reddy , the late cm of andhra pradesh . this is for the first time that the cbi has included the former chief minister 's name in the chargesheet . it named jagan as accused number 1 , followed by 12 other individuals and firms . however , the agency told the court that it had not considered ysr 's name for prosecution as he was not alive . the direct mention of ysr has left the already besieged congress in the state crimson - faced , because the current government is seen as a continuation of the dispensation helmed by the late party leader . most of the ministers , who were privy to the decisions allegedly taken by ysr while making questionable land allotments , also secured berths in the kiran kumar reddy government . unsurprisingly , the ysr congress party headed by jagan has demanded that the cbi also prosecute these ministers , if it found fault with the ysr government 's decisions . the development comes at a time when the congress government in the state is afflicted by multiple crises . the agitation for the separate state of telangana has brought governance to a virtual standstill in andhra pradesh , with mlas as well as mps of the congress themselves hopping over to the side of the protesters . under pressure : andhra pradesh chief minister kiran kumar reddy . doubts have been raised about cm kiran kumar reddy 's leadership ever since he took charge and allegations of corruption have also been levelled often at the current congress government . furthermore , several party leaders are shifting loyalties to the ysr congress . the congress-led union government is also neck-deep in trouble , with a spate of scams related to the commonwealth games , 2-g spectrum allocation , coal block allocation and army truck deals surfacing one after the other . now , as the cbi has indicted ysr in the illegal assets case of jagan , one of the congress 's two citadels in the south -lrb- the other being kerala -rrb- looks all set to crumble . the party 's leaders in the state are trying to wash their hands off the matter by peddling the argument that they could not be held responsible for the acts of omission and commission made by ysr during his regime . ` the state 's cabinet does have collective responsibility , but the ministers are not responsible for surreptitiously struck deals , ' pcc president botsa satyanarayana , who was a key member of the ysr cabinet , claimed . state bjp president g. kishan reddy , however , rejected the defence put up by satyanarayana : 'till his death , ysr was a congressman . so , the party has to pay the penalty for whatever decisions he had taken , ' he said . prime accused jagan 's likely arrest in the case is also giving the congress sleepless nights . sources in the party revealed that the cbi may not arrest ysr 's son till the completion of bypolls to 18 assembly seats in the state in june . this was because the ruling party was apprehensive that jagan 's incarceration at this stage would trigger a serious law and order problem in the state , and there was every possibility of the sympathy factor working in his favour during the byelections . significantly , if jagan 's party wins all the 18 seats , congress leaders could shift en masse to his camp . in paragraph 69 of the chargesheet , the cbi said investigations had revealed that in 2006 , k. nityananda reddy , md of aurobindo pharma limited , and hetero group of companies director m. srinivas reddy had hatched a criminal conspiracy with ysr as well as senior ias official b.p. acharya . the latter , who was then the md of the ap industrial infrastructure corporation , and ysr allegedly colluded to allot 75 acres of land at the pharma special economic zone at jadcherla in mahabubnagar district to the two industry head honchos without in violation of rules . mail today has a copy of the chargesheet filed by the cbi . the cbi disclosed that land was allotted at ` 7 lakh per acre , which was well below the fixed rate , thereby giving a benefit of ` 17.20 crore to the two pharma companies . as a quid pro quo , aurobindo - through the relatives of nityananda reddy - invested ` 3 crore in jagati publications . hetero and its director had pumped in ` 4.5 crore into jagati and ` 15 crore into janani infrastructure , promoted by jaganmohan reddy . the cbi pointed out that apiic chief general manager -lrb- projects -rrb- t.l. ramachandran had rejected the file sent by acharya recommending the allotment of land , stating that the deal could not be struck at just ` 7 lakh per acre . yet acharya had ordered that the corporation give the ` inprinciple letter of allocation ' to the two companies at the same rate citing an approval from ysr . acharya got the clearance papers signed by ysr who had , in turn , personally handed them over to the pharma company representatives , the cbi alleged . intriguingly , the entire exercise was completed in a day . the cbi also found fault with the ysr government for letting aurobindo transfer 30.33 acres out of the land allotted to it at pasamylaram industrial estate at patancheru in medak district to another company , trident life sciences limited . ` jaganmohan , in league with his father ysr , acharya and apiic official yvl prasad entered into the nefarious deal of allotting land to aurobindo and hetero at jadcherla sez by violating norms . other group companies joined the conspiracy and are , therefore , liable for prosecution , ' the cbi chargesheet said . the cbi authorities said these were just a few companies that had benefited from dealing with ysr . in an apparent damage-control exercise , state cabinet minister s. sailaja nath said the kiran kumar reddy government would take back the land allotted to certain companies by ysr . the cbi has been investigating the case following a high court order in august 2011 , based on a petition filed by former state minister p. shankar rao , who had alleged jagan had amassed wealth to the tune of ` 43,000 crore during the regime of his father y.s. rajasekhara reddy between 2004 and 2009 . the business empire of jagan began with taking over of spcl in 2001 from its original promoter m.b.ghorpade with an initial paid up capital of ` 53.51 crore . in 2005 , jagan brought in ` 124.60 crore investments into spcl from two mauritiusbased companies - 2i capital and pluri emerging company . the cbi report says jagan 's auditor v. vijay sai reddy had manipulated the valuation reports of carmel asia and jagathi publications to jack up their values to enable them sell the shares to several high profile investors and companies at a premium of ` 350 per share . jagan had allegedly created fictitious transactions of selling 82 lakh shares of spcl at ` 18.75 each to five companies - sai surya warehousing company limited , excel prosoft limited , sigma . jagan had allegedly diverted the funds from the spcl to float four subsidiary companies - carmel asia holdings pvt ltd , silicon infrastructure pvt ltd , krishna power technologies ltd and bhagavat sannidhi estates pvt ltd. . several companies such as indu projects , ramky infra , pioneer infra , aurobindo pharma , lanco and individuals such as nimmagadda prasad had invested in jagan 's media house .	 congress worries mount as 18 assembly bypolls approach .

' ' i counted that there were six girls in total , ' mr strauss-khan replied . ` that does not seem to me to be a considerable number . ' the magistrate went on : ` do think that if they had not been paid , they would not have agreed to have sex with you on so many occasions , considering the age difference between you ? ' mr strauss-kahn answered : ` numerous young women with whom i 've had sexual exchanges - no , that 's the wrong word - sexual relations , had the same age difference .

' the judge said the money taken by father-of-three emms has never been recovered . prosecutor meirion davies said : ` a lot of work by a lot of good people had helped put money in that fund . beneath contempt : a court heard that julian emms left the michael emms trust fund so bare that not enough was left to pay for his son 's funeral . he is pictured here with michael . ` what sort of man would trick his own son out of that money and use it for his own purposes ? ` it was despicable - someone who could do something like that is beneath contempt .

' but the court heard emms altered one of the cheques to get his hands on the # 16,500 . the jury heard mrs brandon and her husband david had ` second thoughts ' and asked for the cheques to be returned . mr davies said : ` emms was upset that they were suspicious but they had every right to be . ` emms went to their home and burned the cheques in front of them . ` it was theatrical and carefully calculated to hide the fact that one of them was a blank piece of paper . ' the court was told emms had already cashed one cheque for # 16,500 after changing the payee to ` cash ' . mr davies said : ` police searched his his home for the money but emms told them : ` it is not here - i spent it .

' the court heard emms , of beaufort , ebbw vale , south wales , had a # 15,000 business debt at the time the cheque was cashed . emms had broken up from his wife theresa at the time he allegedly stole from the trust fund . the family had to take out a loan to pay for michael 's funeral when he died in april last year . emms , who was found guilty of fraud at an earlier hearing , showed no emotion as he was led away to the cells . crown prosecution spokesman david . watts said after the case : ` many people who gave to the fund will feel . let down and angry to learn what happened to the money they contributed . in good faith .

' , she hung up . the following day , she spoke with a police officer friend , who reported the matter to her superiors . the court heard that after his arrest , gray claimed he had returned to the woman 's home and found her door ajar before forcing his way in because he ` thought something might have happened to her ' . mr coupland said gray told officers he then made his way upstairs and was invited to stay by his alleged victim , who was an ` active participant ' in sex . the court heard gray added that the pair had ` parted on good terms ' with a kiss on the doorstep , and had no idea anything was wrong until he received her phone call . jurors were told the pair had met on a night out with mutual friends around a month before the alleged attack , on july 24 last year . they swapped phone numbers and exchanged ` jokey ' texts before meeting for a drink . the woman said gray appeared ` articulate , funny and pleasant ' , and they met again in nottingham city centre . but she said that despite only having three glasses of wine and lemonade , and a ` strong-tasting ' vodka and coke bought for her by gray , she could not remember much of the evening . she told the jury she had a ` vague recollection ' of being unable to understand why gray got out at her house . the woman added : ' i never invite people back to my house . even if i have decided someone is okay , it is not something i do . i did not even find him attractive . ' i vaguely remember saying he needed to go , i needed to go to bed , and he needed to get a taxi from the top of the road . he went out the back door . ` my memory is of locking the door and putting the chain on . i remember being woken by the bell ringing lots and lots of times . i just ignored it and went back to sleep . ` the next thing , i was aware of a naked person . he was over me . i was in bed . it was not what i wanted .

' some 39 per cent of people who had been to the dentist in the past two years reported there were no leaflets or posters providing information on nhs charges . more than eight in ten people who recently received a course of dental treatment did not receive a written plan spelling out what was to be done and the cost . the oft said : ` we are particularly concerned to find that around 500,000 patients each year may be provided with inaccurate information by their dentist regarding their entitlement to receive particular dental treatments on the nhs , and as a result be required to pay more to receive private dental treatment . ' the oft is also highly critical of the nhs and industry bodies for doing too little to weed out rogue dentists who mislead patients , are incompetent or overcharge . patients ' association chief executive katherine murphy said : ` patients frequently tell us that they are not being given the information they need to make informed choices about their dentistry treatment . they feel they are paying for treatment that may not have been necessary . ` dentists have been able to get away with unacceptable practice . ' the british dental association insisted most patients were ` happy ' . executive board director dr susie sanderson said : ` the delivery of effective dental care is all about good communication between dentists and patients . that communication will not be enhanced by the oft 's headline-grabbing approach to publicising this report . ' labour 's controversial contracts resulted in thousands of dentists quitting the nhs , leaving many communities without a dentist . they were blamed for an estimated one million people losing access to an nhs dentist between 2006 and 2008 . the coalition last year launched pilots of a new dental contract , focused on improving children 's oral health . dentists will be paid for the number of patients they care for and the health results , rather than the number of courses of treatment performed . health minister lord howe said : ` denying patients care on the basis of misinformation is a very serious matter . any dentist that does this risks breaching their contract and we would expect the local nhs to take action . '	 fees in britain are among the highest in europe .   many let teeth rot because they can not afford the work .

' i feel like my future has been destroyed and i have been forced to rethink everything . adam and i have only been together for six months and now he may be my only hope to have children . ' natalie first experienced symptoms in january last year when she started to suffer abdominal pains but it was only when the pain became unbearable in july that she went to nottingham 's a&e department to seek help . pretty in pink : natalie , pictured here on her 18th birthday , had her cervical cancer dismissed as ` women 's troubles ' and cervical erosion before medics gave her the diagnosis . there she was brushed off and told she was suffering from ` women 's troubles ' . natalie was so concerned by the pains she visited her gp a few weeks later and after a brief external examination was told it could be gall bladder infection but was probably nothing to worry about . cervical cancer symptoms do not always present all at once so when the pain went away on its own , natalie decided to take the doctors ' advice not to worry . however , in november , she started her relationship with adam , 23 , and experienced more pain when their relationship became physical . but when she returned to her gp after suffering bleeding , there was still no mention of a smear test - with doctors instead recommending she be tested for sexually transmitted infections . natalie said : ' i was n't very happy about that , i felt like she was assuming i had been sleeping around even though before i got together with adam i had n't been in a relationship with anyone for over a year . ` like a lot of girls , i had lost my virginity at 16 but i was responsible and i had been suffering from stomach cramps for the last year . i knew it could n't be that but i agreed to the tests anyway . ` the nurse explained to me that it would be just like a smear test but i had to say to her that i had never had one because i was only 20 so i was n't allowed one . ` at no point did it occur to anyone to offer me a smear test . ' natalie began bleeding while the swabs were being taken and from the look on the nurse 's face , she says , she knew there was something wrong . natalie , pictured at a charity prom earlier this year with boyfriend adam , 23 , has had to come to terms with not being able to bear children . the doctor was called in and it was agreed that natalie would be referred to a gynaecologist . but , she says , she was assured it was unlikely there was anything wrong because of her young age . the doctor and gynaecologist were convinced natalie was likely to be suffering from a condition called cervical erosion which can cause bleeding in between periods . however a colposcopy and biopsy revealed the worst possible truth . natalie 's test results came back as positive for cancer . she said : ` once someone tells you that you have cancer your whole world stops right there . ' i could n't take in anything else the doctor said after that . i felt dizzy and sick for the rest of the day , it just would n't sink in . ' following an mri scan natalie was told that she may be able to have a trachelectomy , an operation that would remove the affected part of her cervix and then repair it to give her a good chance of being able to have children in future . but on closer inspection of the scan results it was decided the tumour was too large to treat in this way and a radical hysterectomy would be necessary . her tumour had been graded ib-i meaning it was less than 4cm in size and at stage one . she added : ` my womb would be removed so i would never be able to carry children of my own but it would mean i would still have my ovaries so i would n't go through the menopause and i might someday be able to use my eggs in ivf and have children through a surrogate . ` until then i had never really given my fertility much thought . i was studying at night to become a nurse and i was concentrating on my career but i had always imagined that i would have a family someday . ` now i was being forced to think about the future and how it was n't going to pan out the way i imagined . ' natalie underwent the four-and-a-half hour operation in march at nottingham city hospital during which her lymph nodes were removed to be tested to see if the cancer had spread . constant reminder : natalie shows the scar running up her naval on the day she underwent the hysterectomy operation in march this year . but two weeks later she received the news she had been dreading - that the cancer had advanced to her lymph nodes and blood vessels , meaning five weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy which would rob her of her fertility . natalie said : ' i was devastated . i was going to have to watch all my friends have children and my sister who already has a child bringing their families into the world and i would never be able to do the same . ` the treatment was supposed to start in three weeks and it would take at least four to harvest my eggs . the cancer specialist told me not to hold my breath if i wanted to get funding but that they would delay the treatment for an extra week . ' now natalie is in a race against time to harvest enough eggs to create a few embryos with her partner adam that will be frozen for the future . family fear : natalie , pictured right with her mother melanie and half-sister danielle , 20 , has battled through the procedure with family support . even though the young couple have not been together long , adam agreed to the procedure which would give natalie 's eggs a greater chance of survival . even if the ivf is successful , there is only a 32 per cent chance the embryos will take once they are reimplanted . natalie 's half sister leigh-ann cooke , 30 , is at high risk for cervical cancer and receives a smear test every six months . but despite the family history , natalie 's other sister danielle , 20 , was told she was not eligible to have a test when she visited the doctor to ask for one . as a young mum , danielle is at higher risk of cervical cancer too . happier times : pictured in july last year before a holiday with four friends , natalie had no idea what heartbreak lay ahead of her . natalie said : ` i 'm dreading the chemo and i 'm trying not to think about how much it will make me sick . mostly i am terrified of lymphoedema which is one of the common side effects of the drugs they use . ` i 'm also scared of going through the menopause as even my mum has n't gone through it yet and i do n't know what to expect . natalie is part of a campaign to have the age limit lowered and says she is proof that women are being overlooked by the law . the mercedes curnow foundation , set up in memory of the woman by the same name who died of cervical cancer aged 23 , recently presented a 122,600-signature petition to downing street asking to have the age limit for smear tests lowered .	 natalie carney diagnosed with cervical cancer over a year after reporting pains to her gp .   she was dismissed as having ` women 's troubles ' and ` cervical erosion ' before cancer was finally spotted .   natalie believes cancer could have been caught if she had been allowed smear test earlier .

' he has since announced the new packaging . although the 250 cases of kids eating the detergent are a tiny fraction of the thousands of poisoning calls received every year , doctors are still concerned . the symptoms they see in connection with ingesting the packets -- such as nausea and breathing problems -- are more severe than typical detergent poisoning . no deaths have been reported . ` we 're not quite sure why it 's happening , ' said dr. kurt kleinschmidt , a dallas toxicologist and professor at the university of texas southwestern medical center . ` but we 've clearly had some kids who have become much more ill . we look at these pods as being clearly more dangerous than the standard detergent . ' tide , purex and other detergent manufacturers introduced different versions of the packets earlier this year . the lightweight , colorfully swirled plastic packets contain a single-use amount of detergent that dissolves in water . they 're intended to be dropped into a laundry machine in place of liquid or powder detergent . error : some kids mistake the detergent pods -lrb- left -rrb- for ribbon candy -lrb- right -rrb- and eat them . several poison control centers started to get calls from parents about the packets in march and april , soon after they were introduced in earnest . texas reported 71 instances of exposure this year , all but one in march or later . missouri reported 25 cases related to the packets , and illinois reported 26 . ` if you look at the tide pods , they 're bright blue and bright red and they look very similar to some of the ribbon candy , ' said julie weber , director of the missouri poison control center in st. louis.while the detergent packets are a threat , poison control centers receive far more reports about other substances annually . in 2010 , they fielded thousands of calls about potential poisoning to children under 5 from ibuprofen , diaper rash cream and other household substances.however , doctors are alarmed about the packets because they appear to be more dangerous than just swallowing liquid or powder detergent.dr . michael buehler of the carolinas poison center said there were several possible reasons why , including that the packets carry a full cup 's worth of detergent in bite-size form or the detergent in the packet might activate more quickly or differently . caution : purex said its detergent pouch packs come with warning labels about keeping away from children . ` the children get sicker , more severe , and they do this quicker than what we 've seen with standard liquid laundry exposure , ' buehler said . in suburban philadelphia , a 17-month-old boy was home with his mother when she ` turned her back for the proverbial second , ' said dr. fred henretig of the poison control center at the children 's hospital of philadelphia . the boy climbed up on a dresser and popped a detergent package in his mouth , henretig said . the boy vomited , became drowsy and started coughing . he was eventually put on a ventilator for a day and hospitalized for a week , henretig said . poison control centers in several states have issued or are preparing warnings for local emergency rooms and parents . washington state poison control center development director terri suzuki said her center has faxed alerts to emergency rooms and posted about the capsules on its facebook page . the indiana poison control center was expected to advise parents in coming days about the packets ' risk . one child near fort wayne , indiana , tried to eat a packet and nearly had to be placed on a ventilator , said dr. brent furbee , medical director of the indiana poison control center . furbee did not know the child 's age . detergent packets are common in europe , but are a recent addition to the american market , fox said . he said tide pods had done well against other detergent packets , but it was too soon to say if shoppers appeared to be replacing liquid and powder detergent with the packs . kiem ho , vice president for marketing at purex , whose consumer goods division is based in scottsdale , ariz. , said its ultrapacks packaging comes with warning labels to keep out of reach of children . ` this is a new form of laundry product and we will continue to join other manufacturers to safeguard and educate consumers on the correct storage and use of these products in the home ' ho said in a statement .	 parents and doctors worried that kids think the pods are pieces of ribbon candy .   texas reported 71 instances of exposure this year , all but one in march or later .   missouri reported 25 cases related to the packets , and illinois reported 26 .

' he said it was impossible to prevent newspapers causing offence to some portions of the population and that attempts to protect one group would ultimately undermine the ability of the media to hold the powerful to account . clash : mr gove 's outspoken defence of a free press appeared to rile lord justice leveson who repeatedly insisted that new rules were needed to curb excesses . but a clearly irritated lord justice leveson said : ` mr gove , i do not need to be told about the importance of freedom of speech , i really do n't . ' he said he was ` concerned ' by mr gove 's view that behaviour which is ` unacceptable ' has ` to be accepted because of the right of freedom of speech ' . but mr gove was unbowed and said that attempts to stamp out wrongdoing could make things worse . he said previous inquiries had led to regulations that were ` applied in a way to be a cure worse than the disease ' . • guardian journalist amelia hill and a scotland yard detective who was accused of leaking confidential information from the police phone hacking inquiry will not be prosecuted . the crown prosecution service said it would not be in the public interest to bring charges . . theresa may announces new measures to counter police corruption as she gives evidence to inquiry . questioned : theresa may , pictured at the leveson inquiry today , revealed new police hospitality rules have been drawn up . theresa may telephoned two news international executives to reveal she was launching a new inquiry into the disappearance of madeleine mccann . the revelations came amid mounting pressure on the government over its close ties to the murdoch empire . but mrs may denied yesterday that she had been under pressure to deliver a favour to the sun , which was campaigning for a new investigation into maddie 's disappearance in portugal in 2007 . in evidence to the leveson inquiry , the home secretary was asked about the decision to order the new scotland yard probe , which has cost the taxpayer at least # 2million . at the time , the sun and the sunday times had been serialising a book by kate mccann , madeleine 's mother . the sun was pressing strongly for a new investigation into the case . mrs may said she had telephoned -- at her own ` instigation ' -- former news international chief executive rebekah brooks , and dominic mohan , the editor of the sun , to tell them the case would be looked at again . but she denied suggestions that she had been warned that the sun would put her face on its front page every day until she agreed to the paper 's demands . mrs may announced that police would no longer be allowed to accept gifts , gratuities or hospitality apart from ` light refreshments ' under new rules to stamp out corruption . the home secretary said it was important officers did not put themselves in a position where ` people could feel that they are being influenced by the receipt of such gifts ' . mrs may revealed the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- had overhauled guidance to bring a ` clearer ' set of boundaries for meetings between the police and journalists . resigned : sir paul stephenson stepped down as met commissioner last year following revelations he enjoyed a free stay at a luxury health spa . mrs may said : ' i think it 's trying to apply common sense to the relationship the police should have with the media . ' but she reassured lord justice leveson that tighter rules would not stop beat bobbies tipping off local reporters to community news stories . he said : ` it is obviously important that , for example , neighbourhood police officers should be able to speak to local press about events in the neighbourhood - good news stories , concerns , seeking witnesses , all that sort of material . ` it seems to me sensible that everything one can do to encourage that sort of contact is worthwhile . ' the home secretary replied : ` the important thing is for officers to know where the line is drawn between who they are able to speak to and what they are able to say in those conversations . ` it should n't have a chilling effect but i think what 's important is that we have a framework that does n't have a chilling effect and a framework that enables common sense to be operated in these relationships . ' sir paul stephenson resigned as metropolitan police commissioner last year following revelations he enjoyed a free five-week stay worth # 12,000 at champneys luxury health spa , where a former news of the world executive editor arrested over phone-hacking was employed as a pr consultant . at an earlier hearing , the former head of scotland yard told the leveson inquiry that he was ` reluctant ' to accept the freebie but added that he felt under ` pressure ' to return to work after four months ' sick leave . he insisted the five-week stay was organised by the spa 's managing director stephen purdew - and he did not know they employed former news of the world journalist neil wallis , an ` acquaintance ' whom he had met socially on 11 occasions . today , the inquiry heard that mrs may was sent a briefing note preparing her for questions she might face after sir paul 's resignation on july 17 . a guardian journalist and a scotland yard detective will not be prosecuted over leaks relating to the phone-hacking scandal . there is ` insufficient evidence ' to bring charges against amelia hill , the newspaper 's special investigations correspondent , and a 51-year-old detective constable over leaks , prosecutor alison levitt qc said . the police officer has been suspended since being arrested at his desk last august . he was understood to be answering bail this morning , while ms hill has only been questioned under caution . all staff on operation weeting - the metropolitan police 's 16-month inquiry into voicemail interceptions by journalists - were required to sign confidentiality agreements before working on the case . a security review was sparked into how information about the case started appearing in the press over the summer . despite bringing no charges , ms levitt has recommended disciplinary action against the officer . police launched operation weeting , the inquiry devoted specifically to phone hacking on january 26 last year . operation elveden was launched months later after officers were given documents suggesting news international journalists made illegal payments to police officers . it included preparation for issues mps were likely to raise when she made a statement to the commons . one such question suggested it was wrong sir paul felt he could not talk to david cameron or the home secretary about the matter because it might have 'em barrassed the prime minister because of his relationship with andy coulson ' . mrs may was asked if she felt sir paul had been unable to raise the issue but replied : ' i do n't recall any such conversation . ' she told the inquiry that , by the time revelations that murdered schoolgirl milly dowler 's phone was hacked were published on july 4 , she had ` growing concerns ' about the way the press was regulated but still broadly favoured the system that was in place . on the subject of hospitality and gifts being given to the police , mrs may told the inquiry that the ` vast majority ' of officers acted with integrity . she added : ` occasions where there are questions to be raised are very limited . ' until now , police forces have drawn up their own hospitality guidelines , with wide divisions in what was deemed acceptable . acpo suggests allowing officers to receive only ` light refreshments ' during meetings with reporters , seemingly ruling out lavish lunches . the guidelines call for ` more robust decision-making ' and recommend having a single force register of gifts and hospitality governed of the head of professional standards . they will be based on ' a shift to blanket non-acceptability save for a certain circumstances and a common-sense approach to the provision of a light refreshments and trivial and inexpensive gifts of bona fide and genuine gratitude from victims and communities ' . the guidance continues : ` one extreme can properly be considered to be a breach of criminal law -lrb- the bribery act 2010 -rrb- through to the low-level hospitality which could in no way be considered as a breach of integrity on any party involved . ' mrs may said : ' i think that is a sensible approach that is being taken by acpo in an attempt to find a greater consistency . ` what 's important is n't that they have a single force register but that everybody knows that there is a general belief that they should n't be taking gifts , gratuities and hospitality , except where they are of a more trivial nature . ' mrs may later set out her reasons for not ordering a fresh investigation when new phone hacking allegations surfaced in the new york times in september 2010 - four months after she took office . she told the inquiry : ` it was n't the role of the home secretary to decide whether information in a newspaper should be investigated . ` it is the role of the police officers to decide whether information that is printed is new evidence or hints at new evidence such that they feel it is necessary to investigate that . '	 education secretary tells leveson ` cure ' for newspaper wrongdoing could be ` worse than the disease '   he challenges entire basis of inquiry insisting existing law is sufficient .   to police the media .   clashes repeatedly with lord justice leveson who insisted that new .   rules were needed .   home secretary theresa may reveals new rules being brought in banning police officers from accepting all gifts apart from ` light refreshments '   leveson raises fears that tighter rules would stop beat bobbies tipping off local reporters to news stories .   mrs may denies claims that news international pressured her into launching a fresh inquiry into the disappearance of madeleine mccann .

' a 15-year-old schoolgirl died of tuberculosis after a series of doctor errors missed the chance to detect and cure her disease , with her gp claiming she was ` lovesick ' , an inquest heard today . alina sarag died in january last year after a gp allegedly advised her that her physical deterioration was due to mental health problems . the teenager 's father , sultan sarag , told birmingham coroner 's court his daughter was told she needed to see a psychiatrist or even a spiritual healer . alina 's parents called her gp more than 50 times about their daughter 's ailing condition over a four-and-a-half month period before her death . she was also seen by more than five doctors at four different hospitals but medics failed to detect the curable disease . her distraught father , broke down as he told the court : ` the doctor said to her ` did you meet someone on holiday ? are you missing him ? ` she found it very distressing he was suggesting she was lovesick for a boy . ` he said all the problems were in her head and she should see a psychiatrist or spiritual healer . ' mr sarag also claimed dr sharad shripadrao pandit accused him of ` mollycoddling ' alina , and refused to test his daughter for tb . he told the inquest : ` he said : `` we do n't need these tests , we are not going to get them done either . '' ' alina was told by her gp that she may have bulimia and would need to see a psychiatrist , the inquest heard . giving his version of the disputed conversation concerning his recommendation that alina should see a psychologist , dr pandit said it had not taken place in the teenager 's presence . ' i did not do that in front of alina at all . she was terribly young , she was 15 , ' he said . ` she went to the car with her father and i asked her mother to wait . ' i wanted information from the parents , particularly the mother . ' today on the fourth day of the inquest at birmingham coroners court , dr pandit said he ` fully accepted ' tb did not ` cross my mind ' despite knowing she had previously been struck down with the disease in 2009 . but he denied telling her family her illness was ` all in her head . ' dr pandit said : ` there was never any discussion about tb or sign of tb . it did not match her symptoms . i fully accept tb did not cross my mind . ' ` every time she -lsb- alina -rsb- came to see me she walked into the surgery unaided and she never looked unwell . i would not have recorded her condition as ` normal ' if she had not seemed so . father : sultan sarag outside birmingham coroner 's court today . mr sarag told the court her daughter 's gp had told her she was ` lovesick ' tragic : 15-year-old anita , pictured before she died from tuberculosis last year . loss : alina pictured at 14 . a string of doctors at four different hospitals failed to spot her tuberculosis . ` she never presented to me with a cough or night sweats . i would not have behaved in a threatening way to her father as her family have suggested . i would not have told them it was all in her head . ' ' i would not have recorded her condition as ` normal ' if she had not seemed so . she never presented to me with a cough or night sweats . ' i would not have behaved in a threatening way to her father as her family have suggested . ' i would not have told them it was all in her head . ' at the conclusion of his evidence , dr pandit said that , as a gp , he still did not know what else could have been done to save alina 's life . the long-serving doctor , who heads the highgate practice , also attempted to offer his condolences to alina 's family , prompting them to walk out of the courtroom . another gp at the highgate surgery , dr khalid iqbal , told the coroner he believed alina did not have active tb when he assessed her on four dates in september and october 2010 . dr iqbal eventually referred alina to birmingham children 's hospital but did not pass on details of her previous history of latent tb in his referral letter . ' i do n't think she had active tb at the time , ' the doctor said . ` none of the symptoms were suggesting that she had tb . ' memories : sulton sarag and farhat mahmooda , alina 's parents , hold a scrapbook with pictures of alina , pictured right at seven years old . mr sarag - who is also being treated for tb - told the inquest his daughter vomited up to 10 times a day and had to be carried to bed ` like an old woman with weak legs ' . ' i would spend hours rubbing her back , arms , head and neck to try and help ease her pain , ' he said . he added that he made more than 50 phone calls to the gp 's surgery in birmingham but dr pandit failed to return his calls . young : alina aged one at her home in birmingham . mr sarag said : ` there was mass neglect . the medical profession , as soon as they mess up they hide . ' alina first contracted tb in 2009 after a girl at her school was diagnosed with the illness . she was prescribed a course of antibiotics at birmingham chest clinic but medical staff never followed up her treatment . alina was struck down again in july 2010 after returning from a trip to pakistan with her family . the inquest heard a simple phlegm test would have shown alina was suffering from tb but this was never carried out . instead , doctors shrugged off her family 's concerns and told them alina was suffering from a chest infection despite being classed as a ` high risk ' patient . alina 's weight plummeted and at one point she was so ill she could only tolerate baby food . after doctors at heartland and city hospitals did not detect tb , alina was admitted to sandwell hospital where she stayed for five days . tb was picked up but no phlegm test was carried out and a chest x-ray was thought to have found a chest infection . she later saw a clinical psychologist at birmingham children 's hospital but was in too much pain to complete the assessment . on january 6 , 2011 alina was rushed to hospital after suffering breathing difficulties and she died of a cardiac arrest . the hearing continues .	 she was seen by more than five doctors at four different hospitals but none detected illness .   gp admitted tb did not ` cross his mind ' despite previous history .

' after mr monson 's death in hospital on saturday , a close friend suggested one cause may have been rough treatment by police . today , deputy commissioner aggrey adoli , who is in charge of kenyan coast , maintained officers had treated him well . he said : ` this person was found by members of the public smoking bhang -lrb- cannabis -rrb- outside daduri night club and immediately police officers went there to arrest him . ` he was not beaten on any of those occasions . any suggestion to the contrary is baseless and speculative . liberal tradition : alexander monson 's father nicholas , pictured with his second wife maria . ` when he was in custody he complained of feeling dizziness and unwell , and immediate arraignment was done . ` then he was rushed to palm beach hospital with highly qualified and experienced doctors , and died in their hands while being examined . ' mr adoli , whose patch includes the popular palm-fringed beach of diani , added that drugs were found in mr monson 's clothes . he said : ' a half-smoked ` sativa ' cannabis was recovered from him and a further search was conducted and two white tablets were found in his trouser . ` the tablets have been taken to government chemist for analysis . we do n't want to speculate at this point . ' the briton is believed to have spent several weeks living with relatives based in kenya . government pathologist ngari mbuuko and a private expert believed to have been hired by the monson family conducted initial tests yesterday , at pandya memorial hospital , in nearby mombasa . meanwhile samples of urine , blood , liver , kidney and intestines were sent to the capital city nairobi for further analysis by a government chemist . intracranial pressure is the pressure inside the skull that can increase due to brain injury . other causes can include tumour , bleeding into the brain or fluid around the brain , or swelling within it . mr monson 's body remains in the hospital morgue , and it is unclear when it will be released to the family . it is believed that his next of kin may be given samples in order to have separate tests performed by an independent expert . contemporaries of mr monson at # 30,300-a-year marlborough college in wiltshire included pippa middleton , also 28 , but it is unclear whether they were friends . mr monson lived in london but spent much of the year in kenya with his mother hilary , 58 , and sister isabella , 25 . the pair run the four twenty south complex of self-catering cottages in the indian ocean resort of diani , where accommodation can cost up to # 800 a night . trouble in paradise : the beach at diani beach the popular tourist destination on kenya 's south coast where the young british tourist died . his maternal grandparents bought the business in the 1960s . as the heir to the monson baronetcy , alexander was born into a life of privilege . his paternal grandfather was lord monson , a lincolnshire landowner and peer . he was a champion of personal liberties who later became president of the society for individual freedom . when the 11th baron died last year , the title passed to alexander 's father , nicholas john monson , born in 1955 . it is believed baron -lrb- nicholas -rrb- monson , a publisher , is currently in kenya with his third wife , silvana . last night the dead man 's grandmother , lady emma monson , said : ` i 'm a widow myself . i 'm bereaved . i 'm now grieving for my grandson . i 'm extremely upset and i just ca n't talk about it . ' kenyan police said mr monson died in hospital on saturday following his arrest . police spokesman richard mugwai said he had been in custody for just a few hours when he was rushed to hospital after starting to feel sick . the officer said : ` he was arrested outside a nightclub under the suspicion of having taken drugs . ` we made preparations to interview and charge him but he then felt sick . we took him to the hospital and he died in the hands of the doctors . ' it is believed mr monson , who studied at london 's city university until 2008 , entered kenya on april 23 and was due to fly home on july 10 . mr mugwai , the commander of kenya 's coastal kwale county police division , said mr monson was taken to the police station under suspicion of having smoked bhang , a local variety of cannabis . he was later moved to the nearby palm beach hospital , where he died . a foreign office spokesman said : ` we have been providing consular assistance . ' bhang is a natural drug made from dried seeds and leaves from the female cannabis plant . its use originated in india and it is illegal in many countries . popular on the backpacking scene , users often mix it with fruit or alcohol . on his facebook page , mr monson 's father describes himself as ` an enthusiastic cook , a relentless writer , an occasional poet , a passionate advocate , a wayward disciple of the teachings of epicurus and the stoics and a devoted apostle of alain de botton ' . last night a friend who knew the monson family when they lived in bampton , oxfordshire , said : ` it 's awful what happened , it makes me feel sick . ` i heard he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly with a friend . the friend was released but apparently they found drugs on alexander so he was handcuffed and taken . '	 former marlborough schoolboy became ill after being detained by police .   friend claims he suffered police brutality after his arrest .   dead man is son of nicholas monson - 12th baron of monson .   suspected he smoked backpacker drug ` bhang ' a local variety of cannabis .

461	by . ted thornhill . updated : . 04:34 est , 1 december 2011 . one of the rarest events in the universe has been seen by scientists for the first time . a stunning cosmic jet from a super-massive black hole which shredded then swallowed a star has been observed by astronomers . known as ` relativistic jets ' , they can reach hundreds of thousands of light years in length . the swallowing of a star by a black hole only happens once every one hundred million years in a galaxy . scroll down for video . stunning : this illustration shows plasma shooting out of the black hole after it devours a star . such an event took place four billion light years from earth . swift 's ultraviolet/optical -lrb- white , purple -rrb- and x-ray telescopes -lrb- yellow and red -rrb- showing the bursts . most galaxies have super-massive black holes - regions of space that suck in everything nearby with their strong gravitation pull - at their core , with masses of millions or even billions of suns . scientists were first alerted to the . phenomenon in march after nasa 's swift telescope detected several bursts . of x-rays from a quiet patch of sky . teams from both pennsylvania state university and the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics in . cambridge , massachusetts , said the bursts could be the remnants of a star pulled apart when it came too close to a black hole located 3.9 billion light years away . as a star falls toward a black hole , it is ripped apart by intense . tides . the gas is corralled into an accretion disk that swirls around . the black hole and becomes rapidly heated to temperatures of millions of . degrees . the innermost gas in the disk spirals toward the black hole , . where rapid motion and magnetism create dual , oppositely directed ` funnels ' through which some particles may escape . jets driving matter . at velocities greater than 90 percent the speed of light form along the . black hole 's spin axis . in the case of swift j1644 +57 , one of these jets . happened to point straight at earth . dr david burrows , from pennsylvania state university which controls swift , said chemical analysis of the bright flash 's ultraviolet light show it comes from material being sucked into a black hole the size of a million suns . writing in nature , they concluded that the swift satellite just happened to be in the path of the jet of star remains that were shot out at 99.5 per cent the speed of light . dr burrows said : ` incredibly , this source is still producing x-rays and may remain bright . enough for the swift satellite to observe into next year . it behaves . unlike anything we 've seen before .

' in a speech today he will say there is ` no magic bullet ' for tackling obesity , but scientists were generally agreed that while exercise is important , reducing calorie intake is the best way to lose weight . low level intervention such as information about healthy eating ; and what he called middle-rung measures including publishing salt and fat content on packets would not be enough , he said . one government initiative known as the great swapathon involved encouraging people to buy healthier products such as fruit and vegetables with supermarket discount vouchers . however he said there was evidence that families simply used the money they saved to buy more unhealthy food . he said : ` the swapathon is part of the government 's wider initiative of inviting the food industry to help to tackle obesity on a voluntary basis . ` the problem with this , as a food industry director said to the select committee , ` any business is in business to make money and opportunities to influence behaviour will be taken if they are a means to selling more products ' . ' the government has set up a behavioural insights team - also known as the ` nudge unit ' - to find ways of discreetly altering human behaviour by persuasion such as paying fines on time . but lord krebs that this kind of policy was not strong enough to address major problems such as obesity or unsustainable consumption which required ` a shove rather than a nudge ' . during his chairmanship of the food standards agency , krebs criticised the organic food movement , saying that people buying such food were ` not getting value for money . ' yesterday he said the rate of overweight and obese children had doubled in two decades , with major implications for health which would put a huge burden on the healthcare system . he said : ` it is easy to describe the cause of obesity . we live in an environment in which delicious , affordable calories are more readily available and in which our lifestyles have become more sedentary than ever before in our evolutionary history , and our body 's inbuilt regulatory mechanisms are simply not equipped to cope . ` it is much less easy to see how whole populations , not just in this country , but all over the globe , can be persuaded to change their behavior by eating less and/or exercising more ... the central challenge is to find ways of getting populations as a whole to change their behaviour . `	 lord krebs said having an array of sweet treats at children 's eye-level at supermarket checkouts was ` totally inappropriate '

' it is now suggested this could become common practice in a bid to tackle angry campaigners . the idea was proposed earlier this year by tim yeo , chairman of the energy and climate change committee who said : ` we do have to work harder to find places where wind turbines are acceptable and be more creative about sharing the benefits with locals . frankly , we need to bribe them . ' campaigners accused energy secretary ed davey of proposing ` bribes ' to split communities over wind farms . tom leveridge of the campaign to protect rural england said : ` this would fundamentally undermine a core principle of the planning system -- that planning permission should not be bought or sold - and put the countryside at greater risk from poorly sited wind developments . ` a genuine attempt to promote community engagement in the design , location and layout of wind farms should lead to a more sensitive approach to reducing the impact wind turbines can have on our beautiful landscapes . ' there are more than 300 groups actively opposing applications and the government is concerned that less than half of applications are currently being granted by councils . steve hey , chairman of the campaign group no to wold wind farms , which is fighting several turbine applications in east yorkshire , said : ` this already happens . developers bribe people who are not directly affected to back it -- pitching neighbour against neighbour and village against village . ` people who have turbines right next to their house , and have their house price reduced by # 20,000 will not benefit any more than the next village where people might not be affected at all . ` i ca n't believe this government is planning to use money to influence the planning process , it should be about the benefits and costs of the development . you can not buy the english countryside and this will divide communities . i think it 's disgraceful . ' mr davey recently won a battle with george osborne to cut wind subsidies by just 10 per cent , not the 25 per cent the chancellor was pushing for . he said : ` onshore wind has an important role to play in a diverse energy mix that is secure , low carbon and affordable . we know that two thirds of people support the growth of onshore wind . ` but far too often , host communities have seen the wind farms but not the windfall . we are sensitive to the controversy around onshore wind and we want to ensure that people benefit from having wind farms sited next to them . ' he cites a scheme near burnfoot hill wind farm in devon where a community fund of # 2.26 million was put into community projects and another near suide wind farm in argyll , scotland which raises # 28,500 a year . maf smith , deputy chief executive of renewableuk said the wind industry employs 8.600 people and is worth # 500million to the economy and should ` ensure local people share fully in the economic benefits . ' he said : ` thousands of people around the uk are already seeing evidence of this -- wind farm owners donate at least # 1,000 for every megawatt we install , to be spent on community projects like improving sports facilities , village halls and school libraries . '	 wind farm developers could contribute to ` community funds ' to placate campaigners .   critics accuse energy sec ed davey of using ` bribes ' to split communities and throw planning process .

' he said social media has become a ` tool for the spread of racist and abusive content , but it is also a potential means of combating the ignorance and prejudice that lie behind such behaviour ' . football authorities should use online forum to spread ` positive messages ' about equality and diversity , he added . ` more needs to be done to increase the diversity of the pool of candidates for coaches and referees , to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels of the game . ' in response to the committee 's report , the fa said much progress had been made to tackle racism in the game but there remained room for improvement . in a statement the fa said : ` we agree with the committee that whilst substantial progress has been made to promote equality and tackle discrimination in the game , challenges remain for all of the football authorities . ` we remain committed , along with all of our stakeholders , to promoting equality and diversity within the game and to the eradication of all forms of discrimination in football . ` we will continue to work across the entire breadth of the sport to deliver our inclusion and anti-discrimination agenda . in doing so , we will consider in detail how the committee 's recommendations can support and influence this work . ' john terry was acquitted of abusing queens park rangers defender anton ferdinand in a criminal trial at westminster magistrates court but was later charged by the football association . the report also called for more candidates from ethnic minorities to be trained as coaches and referees , with more transparent recruitment of managers and directors to encourage greater ethnic diversity . but it stopped short of recommending the rooney rule be adopted - the system used in american football in the nfl where shortlists for any head coach or senior management vacancy have to have at least one ethnic minority candidate . piara powar , executive director of european anti-discrimination network fare , said the mps had missed an opportunity to set out clear ways of achieving more black managers and coaches . powar said : ` there have been headline issues that english football has experienced over the last year , the luis suarez and john terry cases , and those are very big issues that we need to deal with . ` but the report had no clear direction on diversity hiring practices . `` we now have less racism in football because people respect the achievements of black players but where is their role in the game as coaches and managers . football needs to be given the lead . ` we have a significant asian population in britain but where are the asian players ? '	 culture , media and sport committee says twitter is fueling the problem .   next week john terry will face an fa panel over alleged racist abuse aimed at anton ferdinand .   campaigners say mps should have focused on how to get more black managers into the game .

' some scamps replace the line with : ` should old acquaintance be forgot , and something else that rhymes . ' in total , 2,105 adults responded to the poll commissioned to promote the hollywood film , which features a string of stars including halle berry , michelle pfeiffer , zac efron and sarah jessica parker . meanwhile , many people 's celebrations are being adapted to deal with their financial worries , a survey has found . more people are planning a big night in than the traditional big night out this new year 's eve , with many revellers staying indoors due to concerns about cash . but this does not actualyl make for a cheaper evening , according to the post office home insurance new year survey . nearly three quarters of people -lrb- 74 per cent -rrb- will stay in this year , it found , up from 72 per cent who were planning to stay in last year and 55 per cent in 2007 . money and cost are an important factor in deciding how to see in the new year , with 14 per cent of people citing this as the main reason behind their plans . but those choosing to party at home are set to spend an average of # 95 on food and alcohol - amounting to double the # 48 average spend for those planning on heading out to celebrate . post office head of home insurance , gerry barrett , said : ` new year 's eve can end up being a costly night , and as our research shows bizarrely , it can be even more costly for those who plan to stay in . ' mr barrett said the survey of 2,016 uk adults showed people look set to be emulating diners in channel 4 programme come dine with me . he said : ` come dine with me fever is apparently gripping the nation as more people than ever plan to stay at home or hold dinner parties , but many hosts could see their bills mount up as they look to impress their friends . ' while the lyrics for auld lang syne are attributed to robert burns , it is likely that he merely adapted the words of an old ballad . burns apparently sent a copy of the song to the scots musical museum with the remark : ` the following song , an old song , of the olden times , and which has never been in print , nor even in manuscript until i took it down from an old man . ' the poet also wrote a letter to mrs agnes dunlop , attaching his version of auld lang syne , in which he comments : ` light be the turf on breast of the heaven-inspired poet who composed this glorious fragment ! there is more of the fire of native genius in it than in half a dozen of modern english bacchanalians . ' some say the famous chorus actually dates from the middle of the 16th century , if not before . the phrase ` auld lang syne ' is also used in similar poems by robert ayton -lrb- 1570 -- 1638 -rrb- , allan ramsay -lrb- 1686 -- 1757 -rrb- , and james watson -lrb- 1711 -rrb- as well as older folk songs predating burns . contemporary scottish poet matthew fitt uses the phrase ` in the days of auld lang syne ' as the equivalent of ` once upon a time ... ' in his retelling of fairy tales . but for those who need to brush up for the big night ... should auld acquaintance be forgot , and never brought to mind ? should auld acquaintance be forgot , and auld lang syne ! chorus . for auld lang syne , my dear , for auld lang syne . we 'll tak a cup o ' kindness yet , for auld lang syne . and to really impress here are verses two to five ... and surely ye 'll be your pint stowp!and surely i 'll be mine!and we 'll tak a cup o'kindness yet , for auld lang syne.we twa hae run about the braes , and pou 'd the gowans fine ; but we 've wander 'd mony a weary fit , sin ' auld lang syne.we twa hae paidl 'd in the burn , frae morning sun till dine ; but seas between us braid hae roar ` dsin ' auld lang syne.and there 's a hand , my trusty fere!and gie 's a hand o ' thine!and we 'll tak a right gude-willie waught , for auld lang syne .	 poll found that some 37 per cent do not know a single line of robert burns 's piece , written in 1788 .   and many will be singing it at home this year as more and more opt for a night in on new year 's eve .

' t-dm1 is known as an ` antibody-drug conjugate ' , which is the first medicine of its kind for breast cancer . it joins together the accuracy of the her2-targeted antibody , called herceptin , with the power of the chemotherapy agent , dm1 , as a single therapy . t-dm1 has been designed to find and destroy only the cancerous cells in a two-stage attack . firstly , it attaches to the cancer growth and blocks signals that encourage the tumour to get larger and spread . then it penetrates the cell 's outer defences and releases a high dose of chemotherapy to destroy it from within . the study 's results have been welcomed by breast cancer survivor , joanne smith , from whickham , gateshead . the 41-year-old , who was diagnosed in 2005 and had treatment over four years , said : ` anything that helps people beat breast cancer is going to be good news and is very welcome . ` it 's lovely that advances are being made and it 's especially lovely that the north east has played a part in it . ' results from the study show that more patients responded to t-dm1 and for a longer period of time , compared with the currently licensed treatment known as lapatinib plus capecitabine chemotherapy . researchers believe the technique of attaching a powerful chemotherapy to an antibody , like herceptin , could also change the way other breast cancers are treated in the future . t-dm1 is already being trialled in the earlier stages of the disease where side-effects caused by chemotherapy , like diarrhoea and hair loss , have a huge impact on patients . the drug is not yet available for use . but based on the study 's results , a licence application will be made for its approval in the uk and europe . following authorisation from the european medicines agency , t-dm1 could be made available to patients in the uk in less than a year .	 drug t-dm1 proven to stall the disease longer than current treatments , says nhs trust .   drug block growth of cancer , then destroys cancer cells from within .   could be available for sufferers within a few years .

' similarly former prime minister gordon brown was left embarrassed when he claimed to be a fan of rock band the arctic monkeys but admitted he could not name one of their songs . as the band start to play their single , silenced by the night , the camera panned to the guests . originally there is no reaction from mr osborne who stared at the group looking nonplussed as these pictures show . but when the politician realises the camera is focused on him , he completely changes his body language . in cringe-worthy fashion the tory mp looks straight at the camera before looking back at the band and bobbing his head in time to the music . the hilarious attempt to look interested has been mocked on youtube in a video titled ` the art of politics no. 1 : george osborne . ' in a humorous text commentary that accompanies the clip , it reads : ` the andrew marr show loves to sign off with a bit of music . in this case keane , led by their uncanny david cameron lookalike . ` as the band performs , the show 's other guests watch from the sofa . ` one of this week 's guests was george osborne . what did george think ? not a rave review . ` but watch his reaction when he realises the camera 's on him . great recovery . ' the video has already had more than 1,200 hits and provoked some funny comments online . one wrote : ` the weeping angel of crowd-pleasing .

' the whittamore database records show that as a result of the ` claridges blag ' , information was obtained about a four-day hotel stay , in a room which cost # 411.25 per night . the total bill was # 3,433.98 . the records show that the hotel stay in question was in the month of july , but do not specify a year . upmarket : claridges hotel in mayfar , central london , where mr agostinelli ran up a # 3,433.98 bill . searches through media databases do not indicate that stories about agostinelli appeared in the news of the world in the period before or soon after the police raid during which whittamore 's records were seized . some years later , press articles did mention mr agostinelli as a member of a group which was interested in buying liverpool fc , but ultimately lost out to another american bidder . blow : rupert murdoch appears at the leveson inquiry , which is investigating the practices and ethics of the press . mr agostinelli appeared as no. 19 in the 2011 edition of an annual ` rich list ' published by murdoch 's sunday times . the paper said mr agostinelli was now ` london-based ' , with estimated wealth of # 625million , and counted former french president nicholas sarkozy as a friend . the journalist named in the whittamore database as having commissioned the private detective to investigate mr agostinelli , who now works for a different newspaper , said he had never heard of the tycoon and maintained that the database entry referring to him was inaccurate . mr agostinelli did not respond to messages left for him at rhone group offices in new york and london . a spokesman for claridges declined to comment . murdoch 's uk newspaper empire is the principal target of the leveson inquiry into the practices and ethics of the british press . a spokeman for news international said : ` the information ... was the subject of a report by the information commissioner 's office in 2006 and has been examined extensively by the leveson inquiry in recent months . news international has given detailed evidence on these matters . ' the spokesman added : ` there is a public interest defence available for any potential breach of the data protection act and you do not have the information necessary to make any judgement on specific cases . we are not in a position to comment on a specific case .
