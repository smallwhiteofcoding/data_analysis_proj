0	editor 's note : in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . here , soledad o'brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill . an inmate housed on the `` forgotten floor , '' where many mentally ill inmates are housed in miami before trial . miami , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the ninth floor of the miami-dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the `` forgotten floor . '' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for leifman , justice is served . e-mail to a friend .

'' his father said he was on the roof of his house when cnn called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son . `` we just want to thank everyone who has come forward , '' he said . `` we knew there was kindness out there . '' like his wife , he could n't stop smiling . he talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in baghdad , leaving `` no stone unturned '' on a mission to help his boy . there were many trips to the ministry of health . he says he even put in a request to iraq 's parliament for help . the family eventually told cnn their story -- that youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on january 15 , doused in gasoline and set on fire . simply by coming forward , his parents put themselves in incredible danger . no one has been arrested or held accountable in youssif 's case . watch cnn 's arwa damon describe ` truly phenomenal ' outpouring '' shortly after youssif 's story aired wednesday , the children 's burn foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in sherman oaks , california , that provides support for burn victims locally , nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for youssif and his family to come to the united states and to set up a fund for donations . you can make a donation at the foundation 's site by clicking here . there 's a drop-down menu under the `` general donation '' area that is marked `` youssif 's fund .

'' youssif 's parents said they know it 's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in america may not be easy . but none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost . `` i will do anything for youssif , '' his father said , pulling his son closer to him . `` our child is everything . '' his mother tried to coax youssif to talk to us on this day . but he did n't want to ; his mother says he 's shy outside of their home . the biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave , and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in iraq . but this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that january day -- has new hope in the world . that is partly due to the tens of thousands of cnn.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act . cnn iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border . in a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world , it was a refreshing realization . e-mail to a friend . cnn.com senior producer wayne drash contributed to this report in atlanta .

5	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the national football league has indefinitely suspended atlanta falcons quarterback michael vick without pay , officials with the league said friday . nfl star michael vick is set to appear in court monday . a judge will have the final say on a plea deal . earlier , vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in virginia . `` your admitted conduct was not only illegal , but also cruel and reprehensible . your team , the nfl , and nfl fans have all been hurt by your actions , '' nfl commissioner roger goodell said in a letter to vick . goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over . in papers filed friday with a federal court in virginia , vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well . falcons owner arthur blank said vick 's admissions describe actions that are `` incomprehensible and unacceptable . '' the suspension makes `` a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated , '' he said in a statement . watch what led to vick 's suspension '' goodell said the falcons could `` assert any claims or remedies '' to recover $ 22 million of vick 's signing bonus from the 10-year , $ 130 million contract he signed in 2004 , according to the associated press . vick said he would plead guilty to one count of `` conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture '' in a plea agreement filed at u.s. district court in richmond , virginia . the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine , `` full restitution , a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release , '' the plea deal said . federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines . `` the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense , '' the plea agreement said . in an additional summary of facts , signed by vick and filed with the agreement , vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs , but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won . `` most of the ` bad newz kennels ' operations and gambling monies were provided by vick , '' the official summary of facts said . gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators tony taylor , quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace , it continued . `` vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights . vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by ` bad newz kennels . ' '' vick also agreed that `` collective efforts '' by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs . around april , vick , peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vick 's property in virginia , the statement said . `` peace , phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in ` testing ' sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods , including hanging and drowning . `` vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace , phillips and vick , '' the summary said . peace , 35 , of virginia beach , virginia ; phillips , 28 , of atlanta , georgia ; and taylor , 34 , of hampton , virginia , already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences . vick , 27 , is scheduled to appear monday in court , where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge . see a timeline of the case against vick '' the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement . the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy , but vick 's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges , according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin . `` it sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior , '' toobin said friday . `` the risk for vick is , if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea , the state of virginia could say , ` hey , look , you admitted violating virginia state law as well . we 're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court . ' '' in the plea deal , vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary . vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests . vick agreed to `` make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated '' with the dogs that are being held by the government . `` such costs may include , but are not limited to , all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case , including if necessary , the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals . '' prosecutors , with the support of animal rights activists , have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs . but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted co-conspirators . judge henry e. hudson issued an order thursday telling the u.s. marshals service to `` arrest and seize the defendant property , and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property . '' both the judge 's order and vick 's filing refer to `` approximately '' 53 pit bull dogs . after vick 's indictment last month , goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons training camp , and the league is reviewing the case . blank told the nfl network on monday he could not speculate on vick 's future as a falcon , at least not until he had seen `` a statement of facts '' in the case . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mike phelan contributed to this report .

'' snow , speaking after bush at the start of the daily white house news conference , said he was leaving to earn more money . he took a big pay cut , he said , when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for fox news . according to the washington post , snow makes $ 168,000 as the white house spokesman . his family took out a loan when he started the job , `` and that loan is now gone .

8	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- as he awaits a crucial progress report on iraq , president bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out . president bush pauses tuesday during a news conference at the north american leaders summit in canada . on wednesday in kansas city , missouri , bush will tell members of the veterans of foreign wars that `` then , as now , people argued that the real problem was america 's presence and that if we would just withdraw , the killing would end , '' according to speech excerpts released tuesday by the white house . `` three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left , '' bush will say . `` whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , ' '' the president will say . the president will also make the argument that withdrawing from vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising u.s. credibility , citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam , according to the excerpts . `` here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , '' bush will say . on tuesday , democratic senate majority leader harry reid said , `` president bush 's attempt to compare the war in iraq to past military conflicts in east asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two . our nation was misled by the bush administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of iraq under false pretenses , leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history . `` while the president continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in iraq , paid for by the taxpayers , american lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the iraqi government . it is time to change direction in iraq , and congress will again work to do so in the fall . '' the white house is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the american legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in iraq until the report comes out in september . watch bush criticize the iraqi government '' it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush in wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from asia , including the u.s. defeat and occupation of japan after world war ii and the korean war in the 1950s , according to the excerpts . `` in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' bush will say . `` today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies . '' speaking about the korean war , bush will note that at the time `` critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that america 's intervention was divisive here at home . '' `` while it is true that the korean war had its share of challenges , america never broke its word , '' bush will say . `` without america 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the south koreans after the war , millions of south koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime .

15	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a virus found in healthy australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the united states , researchers reported thursday . honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the bee research laboratory , in beltsville , maryland . colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some u.s. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination , such as oranges , blueberries , apples and almonds . the u.s. department of agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $ 15 billion worth of crops each year in the united states . more than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination . signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the united states in 2004 , the same year american beekeepers started importing bees from australia . the disorder is marked by hives left with a queen , a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food , but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone . the virus identified in the healthy australian bees is israeli acute paralysis virus -lrb- iapv -rrb- -- named that because it was discovered by hebrew university researchers . although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish , bees infected with iapv die close to the hive , after developing shivering wings and paralysis . for some reason , the australian bees seem to be resistant to iapv and do not come down with symptoms . scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that iapv was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time . but the study released thursday on the science express web site , operated by the journal science , cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors . `` this research give us a very good lead to follow , but we do not believe iapv is acting alone , '' said jeffery s. pettis of the u.s. department of agriculture 's bee research laboratory and a co-author of the study . `` other stressors on the colony are likely involved . '' this could explain why bees in australia may be resistant to colony collapse . `` there are no cases ... in australia at all , '' entomologist dave britton of the australian museum told the sydney morning herald last month . `` it is a northern hemisphere phenomenon . '' bee ecology expert and university of florida professor jamie ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time , pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors . researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the u.s. mainland but are not found in australia . university of georgia bee researcher keith s. delaplane said thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope . `` one nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind , '' said delaplane , who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite . `` but in the case of iapv , there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder . this is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease - and pest-resistant . '' bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees . `` the next step is to ascertain whether iapv , alone or in concert with other factors , can induce ccd -lsb- colony collapse disorder -rsb- in healthy bees , '' said ian lipkin , director of the center for infection and immunity at columbia university mailman school of public health . besides the columbia and usda researchers , others involved in the study released thursday include researchers from pennsylvania state university , the pennsylvania department of agriculture , the university of arizona and 454 life sciences . e-mail to a friend .

'' it is n't shakespeare , but it is the dramatic question hollywood filmmakers are asking about lindsay lohan following her legal troubles this week . lindsay lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled , but the cost will be high . it is an important question , too , because whether companies insure lohan 's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off hollywood 's a-list . but lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable , say underwriting experts . while some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars , experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison , even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost . `` for a price , anything can be done , although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just wo n't be interested , '' said ross miller , partner with insurance brokerage d.r. reiff & associates inc. . lohan 's arrest this week in los angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left hollywood wondering if the actress , who shot to fame as a child in disney films like `` the parent trap , '' is too risky to cast in a film . timeline : lindsay lohan 's troubles '' it remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in `` poor things , '' a film produced by and starring oscar-winner shirley maclaine . see a gallery of lohan 's films '' a statement was expected early next week on whether the movie , already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by lohan , will proceed with or without her . insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations , although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of lohan and fellow troubled party girls paris hilton and britney spears . `` i do n't think it -lrb- a problematic artist -rrb- is any more of an issue , '' said wendy diaz , entertainment underwriting director at fireman 's fund insurance co. , the leading film underwriter . `` it 's pretty standard year to year . '' but diaz did say the terms for covering lohan would likely be `` serious at this point . '' she said fireman 's fund , in such a case , would likely put in higher deductibles , or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted . last july , a producer on lohan 's last film , `` georgia rule , '' scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set , costing the movie 's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars . brian kingman , a managing director with entertainment insurance broker aon/albert g. ruben said covering situations like lohan 's required a lot of calculation and risk management . insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie 's production budget , which can range from $ 5 million to $ 100 million or more , he said . `` filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk , '' kingman said . he said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance . in certain circumstances , drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples . in cases of known drug abuse , `` minders '' are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor . kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration . `` i have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules , '' he said , citing the case of robert downey jr. , another high-profile star with a history of legal , drug and alcohol problems . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .

'' -rrb- . but , in the kinks ' official biography , davies tells a different story . he says `` lola '' was written after the band 's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him . 4 . `` 867-5309 / jenny '' written by : jim keller -lrb- of tommy tutone -rrb- and alex call . written for : unknown , as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they 're asked . while the woman continues to remain a mystery , however , the phone number is all too real . in fact , it 's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time has n't quelled of the number of crank calls . in 1999 , brown university freshman roommates nina clemente and jahanaz mirza found that out the hard way , when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system . immediately , the girls ' innocuous room no. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish . other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions , like the holder of 212-867-5309 , who put his phone number up for auction on ebay in 2004 . bids approached $ 100,000 before ebay pulled the item at the request of verizon , the number 's actual owner . 5 . `` oh , carol '' written by : neil sedaka . written for : carole king , naturally . sedaka and king actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance sedaka was able to successfully milk with `` oh , carol , '' a then top-10 -lrb- if now somewhat forgettable -rrb- 1959 pop song . however , the real success of `` oh , carol '' came a few months later , when it inspired king to write a rebuttal entitled `` oh , neil . '' at the time , king and her husband , gerry goffin , were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune . `` oh , neil '' was n't that , but it did pay off . after sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss , king and goffin landed jobs at the legendary brill building pop music factory , where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like `` will you still love me tomorrow '' and `` the loco-motion . '' 6 . `` it ai n't me , babe '' written by : bob dylan . written for : joan baez , though it clearly was n't the nicest gift dylan could have given her . the two met in 1961 , when baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and dylan was a nobody from minnesota . desperate to make his break in the music biz , dylan worked like crazy to get baez 's attention . he eventually ended up going on tour with her , which is how he first became famous , and also how the two began dating . for a while , they seemed like the golden couple , but things soon went downhill . during a european concert tour together in early 1965 , they had a huge fight and parted ways . that may , dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus , and baez , hoping to remain friends , decided to bring him flowers . sadly , that 's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else . that someone else was sara lownds , whom dylan married a mere six months later . 7 . `` our house '' written by : graham nash -lrb- of crosby , stills , nash & young -rrb- . written for : joni mitchell . in december 1968 , nash and mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the laurel canyon section of los angeles . though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon , laurel canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for san francisco society -- not just csn&y , but also jim morrison , the eagles , frank zappa , and more . `` our house '' was directly inspired by a lazy sunday in the nash/mitchell household . the couple went out to brunch , hit an antiques store , and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly , at which point nash literally `` lit a fire , '' while mitchell `` placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day . '' no , really . the whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it . e-mail to a friend .
22	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- youssif , the 5-year-old burned iraqi boy , rounded the corner at universal studios when suddenly the little boy hero met his favorite superhero . youssif has always been a huge spider-man fan . meeting him was `` my favorite thing , '' he said . spider-man was right smack dab in front of him , riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes . the legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted , walked over to youssif and introduced himself . spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug , embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights . he showed youssif a few tricks , like how to shoot a web from his wrist . only this time , no web was spun . `` all right youssif ! '' spider-man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement . other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look . even the green goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi . youssif remained unfazed . he did n't take a liking to spider-man 's nemesis . spidey was just too cool . `` it was my favorite thing , '' the boy said later . `` i want to see him again . '' he then felt compelled to add : `` i know it 's not the real spider-man . '' this was the day of dreams when the boy 's nightmares were , at least temporarily , forgotten . he met spongebob , lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named archie . the hairy , brownish-red primate took to the boy , grabbing his hand and holding it . even when youssif pulled away , archie would inch his hand back toward the boy 's and then snatch it . see youssif enjoy being a boy again '' the boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns . it was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central baghdad , as recently as a week ago . he squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could . he rode a tram through the back stages at universal studios . at one point , the car shook . fire and smoke filled the air , debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle . the boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed . `` even i was scared , '' the dad said . `` well , i was n't , '' youssif replied . the father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day . youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister , ayaa , in a stroller . `` did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here ? '' youssif 's father said in amazement . `` other than my wedding day , this is the happiest day of my life , '' he said . just a day earlier , the mother and father talked about their journey out of iraq and to the united states . they also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home , doused him in gas and set him on fire . his mother heard her boy screaming from inside . the father sought help for his boy across baghdad , but no one listened . he remembers his son 's two months of hospitalization . the doctors did n't use anesthetics . he could hear his boy 's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital . watch youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister '' the father knew that speaking to cnn would put his family 's lives in jeopardy . the possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer , he said . `` anything for youssif , '' he said . `` we had to do it . '' they described a life of utter chaos in baghdad . neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl . shortly afterward , the father was kidnapped and killed . then , there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans . they were snatched off the street by gunmen . the stories can be even more gruesome . the couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded -- and her killers sewed a dog 's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family 's doorstep . `` these are just some of the stories , '' said youssif 's mother , zainab . under saddam hussein , there was more security and stability , they said . there was running water and electricity most of the time . but still life was tough under the dictator , like the time when zainab 's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a `` religious book , '' she said . sitting in the parking lot of a target in suburban los angeles , youssif 's father watched as husbands and wives , boyfriends and girlfriends , parents and their children , came and went . some held hands . others smiled and laughed . `` iraq finished , '' he said in what few english words he knows . he elaborated in arabic : his homeland wo n't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon . it 's just not possible . too much violence . too many killings . his two children have only seen war . but this week , the family has seen a much different side of america -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home . `` it 's been a dream , '' the father said . he used to do a lot of volunteer work back in baghdad . `` maybe that 's why i 'm being helped now , '' the father said . at universal studios , he looked out across the valley below . the sun glistened off treetops and buildings . it was a picturesque sight fit for a hollywood movie . `` good america , good america , '' he said in english . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's arwa damon contributed to this report .
23	las vegas , nevada -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former football star o.j. simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges , police announced late sunday . police released this mug shot of o.j. simpson after his arrest . simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a las vegas hotel room . las vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the palace station hotel and casino . police said simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia , including some that was unrelated to simpson , police said . `` we do n't believe that anyone was roughed up , but there were firearms involved , '' lt. clint nichols told reporters . nichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims . a reporter asked nichols : was `` o.j. was the boss in that room ? '' nichols responded , `` that is what we believe , yes . '' watch simpson transferred sunday in handcuffs '' the alleged victims were identified as bruce fromong , a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as `` a home invasion-type robbery , '' and alfred beardsley , who has been quoted by celebrity web site tmz.com as saying that simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident . acting on a tip , police met over the weekend at mccarran international airport with 46-year-old walter alexander , of mesa , arizona , who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster 's information , capt. james dillon told reporters . alexander was arrested saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon , two counts of assault with a deadly weapon , conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon . he was released on his own recognizance and returned to mesa either saturday night or early sunday morning , dillon said . in addition , investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied simpson into the hotel room , nichols said . nichols said , `` there is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and o.j. simpson . '' though simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself , two firearms that police said were used were recovered early sunday in one of three searches . investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found . nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police . `` there is no truth to that whatsoever , '' he said . `` that came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police . '' simpson , 60 , has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him , but he has denied that any weapons were involved . `` whether the property belonged to mr. simpson or not is still in debate , '' nichols said . `` we are still in the process of sorting that out . '' nichols also said that some of the property taken had simpson 's signature . but `` there was some other property taken as well , '' he said . `` i believe there were some joe montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff . '' the latest charges against simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution , more than a decade after the june 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife , nicole brown simpson , and ron goldman . simpson was acquitted of murder the following year . the trial riveted much of the united states . but in 1997 , a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the goldman family . simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $ 33.5 million for the deaths . goldman had gone to nicole simpson 's los angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings . goldman 's sister , kim goldman , said she was n't surprised by the robbery allegations , since simpson `` thinks he can do no wrong . '' `` he 's capable of stabbing people to death , so i think robbery is nothing surprising , '' she said . `` normal , logical , civil-minded , law-abiding people do n't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back . '' fromong had testified on simpson 's behalf in the civil case , telling the court that prices for simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict . his testimony was part of the defense 's contention that simpson could not afford to pay the goldmans . simpson recently wrote a book originally titled `` if i did it '' and had planned to publish it himself , but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal . a bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award . the goldmans retitled the book , `` if i did it : confessions of the killer . '' that book just hit bookstores . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ted rowlands contributed to this report .

26	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the united states at risk , the department of justice announced thursday . sources say the classified materials were taken from the east tennessee technology park . roy lynn oakley , 67 , of roane county , tennessee , appeared in federal court in knoxville on thursday . oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in january , when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials , government sources told cnn . he voluntarily surrendered thursday at an fbi field office in knoxville , the sources said . oakley is a former employee of bechtel jacobs , the department of energy 's prime environmental management contractor at the east tennessee technology park , prosecutors said . the indictment states that oakley , `` having possession of , access to and having been entrusted with sections of ` barriers ' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the united states and secure an advantage to a foreign nation , did communicate , transmit and disclose such data to another person . '' the transfer took place january 26 , the indictment alleges . oakley is also charged with converting the material and `` restricted data '' to his own use . he began doing so on about october 17 , 2006 , and continued through january , prosecutors said . prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them . oakley 's attorney , herb moncier , said outside court thursday that oakley 's job was to break rods `` into little pieces '' and throw them away . moncier said oakley had a security clearance , but moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance . the government alleges that in january , oakley attempted to sell the `` pieces of scrap '' to someone he thought was a french agent -- but in reality was an undercover fbi agent , moncier said . he said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an `` appliance '' under the law . `` mr. oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months , '' said moncier , who added that he had traveled to washington for work on the case . each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . `` while none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization , the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands , '' kenneth wainstein , assistant attorney general for national security , said in the justice department statement . one government source said the materials involved are not the `` crown jewels , '' but they should not have been taken from the facility . a `` barrier '' is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process , according to nuclear energy officials , but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job . sources told cnn that federal authorities have been following oakley and investigating the case for at least six months , after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material . oakley , described as a low-level employee , apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind , an official familiar with the case said . a government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of oakley 's alleged intentions six months ago , the fbi and department of energy launched a joint investigation . the fbi then developed a sting operation , government officials familiar with the case said , and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country . east tennessee technology park is an area of the doe 's oak ridge reservation `` where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985 , '' gerald boyd , manager of the doe 's oak ridge site office , said thursday . `` when they were in use , now over 20 years ago , some of the buildings at ettp housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium . '' boyd said the technology park and the reservation `` are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs , both visible and unseen , meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position .

28	hong kong , china -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- paul lee got his liver from an executed chinese prisoner ; karam in egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $ 5,300 ; in istanbul hakan is holding out for $ 30,700 for one of his kidneys . doctors in pakistan have been arrested for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys . they are not so unusual : a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like china , pakistan , turkey , egypt , colombia and the philippines to buy a new lease of life . lee , a 53-year-old chief subway technician in hong kong , was diagnosed with liver cancer in january 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread . a friend told him about a transplant hospital in china 's north eastern tianjin city and he signed up for a place . that april , he paid 260,000 yuan -lrb- $ 34,380 -rrb- for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life . `` the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons , '' lee told reuters . `` mine came from an executed prisoner from heilongjiang . i thank the donor deeply . '' the world health organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually , but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000 . demand for kidneys also exceeds supply , and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and `` transplant tourists '' who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living . a donor in south africa receives $ 700 for a kidney compared with $ 30,000 in the united states . a lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on , or at least regulate , the trade . but even where the trade is banned , laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes , which are sometimes defended by vested interests . and the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient . any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor 's liver . the complications can include bleeding , infection , even death . in the transplant trade , the recipient need not worry about , for example , exposing a living relative to that risk . `` it is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you do n't have to care for someone you do n't know . once you pay , it is discarded in a way , it is dispensable , '' said luc noel , a geneva-based coordinator for clinical procedures at the world health organization . china recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners , saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year . only 20,000 transplants are carried out in china each year . of these , 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors . china defended its use of organs from executed prisoners , saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families . a transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $ 33,000 in china . `` what is important is the transparency , it has to be open to scrutiny ... if china makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent , that would do good , '' said the who 's noel . in asia , a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs . excluding china , asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year , said lo chung-man , professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the university of hong kong . pakistan , where trade in human organs is not illegal , is turning into a `` kidney bazaar '' , said the chief executive of pakistan 's kidney foundation , jaffar naqvi . there are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but naqvi said there were 13 centers in lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys . patients , mostly from europe , saudi arabia and india , pay about 500,000 rupees -lrb- $ 8,500 -rrb- for a new kidney , he said . donors are paid $ 300 to $ 1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery . there is no consent in some cases . in may police arrested nine people , four of them doctors , for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations . in the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade , but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative , with no payment . such a clause allowing `` altruistic '' organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors , naqvi said . stories of people selling their organs , especially kidneys , are not uncommon in egypt , where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line . karam , who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal , said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure . he said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 egyptian pounds -lrb- $ 5,300 -rrb- . `` the fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds . both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the ` donor ' received , '' said karam . he said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients ' lists . abdel-kader hegazy , head of the disciplinary committee at the doctors ' union , said egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants , making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence . `` the law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment . we at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices , but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back , '' he told reuters . `` it is an annoying and a regrettable situation . well-known doctors and professors are doing this . they are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values . '' the union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants , with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities . but the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior muslim religious leaders on whether islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths . in turkey , students , unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the internet selling their kidneys , listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type . these would-be donors say they have had enquiries from germany , israel and turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira -lrb- $ 38,760 -rrb- . hakan , a 27-year-old security guard in istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published , told reuters he received five or six offers from turkey and germany , offering 10,000-15 ,000 lira -lrb- $ 11,600 -rrb- , but he 's holding out for 40,000 lira . `` of course it 's frightening but there 's nothing else to be done , '' he said , adding he had n't told his wife as he knew she would object . `` i 'm doing it because of my family , if i was alone it would n't matter . i 've got two children ... there 's nothing else i can do for them .

30	phuket , thailand -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- relatives of the 89 people killed in sunday 's plane crash in phuket continued to arrive in the thai resort town on tuesday to try to identify their loved ones ' remains . a buddhist monk blesses the wreckage of one-two-go airline 's md-82 jet at phuket airport on tuesday . most of those killed were foreign nationals , and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified , according to thailand 's state-run thai news agency -lrb- tna -rrb- . all of the unidentified victims were foreign nationals , it reported . the u.s. embassy in bangkok said that five americans were among those killed when the one-two-go jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at phuket 's airport on sunday . u.s. officials had previously confirmed that four americans died in the crash , and one survived . eight british nationals are believed to have died , according to foreign secretary david miliband . he said three were still in hospital , with one in a critical condition . thailand 's public health minister mongkol na songkhla said that of the 41 survivors who remain hospitalized , 38 were in stable condition and three in critical condition , according to tna . flight 269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members when it left bangkok for phuket on sunday afternoon . nationalities of the survivors include british , american , swedish , iranian , austrian , australian , thai , german , irish , italian , israeli and dutch , authorities said . watch a survivor recall the fiery horror '' one man who arrived in phuket on tuesday from paris described a frustrating process of trying to communicate with thai officials in his effort to locate the remains of his brother . for some families , dna testing may be the only way to positively identify their relatives . meanwhile , buddhist , christian and muslim leaders gathered outside phuket 's airport on tuesday to remember those killed . the investigation into what caused the crash continues , but the strong winds and rain are a suspected factor . u.s. officials are aiding in the investigation because the aircraft -- a boeing md-82 -- was manufactured in the united states . one air traffic controller at phuket airport said pilots were warned of possible wind shear , which is dramatic changes in wind speed and direction . airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour -lrb- 11 miles an hour -rrb- with stronger gusts , but no planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions . the decision to land was the pilot 's alone , according to phuket 's airport manager . `` air traffic control would give weather information to pilot and warning information but the final decision is dependent on the pilot , '' pornchai eua-aree said . one-two-go officials would not speculate on what may have happened , saying they will wait for the findings of the investigation . but they did say their aircraft were regularly checked and maintained , and denied some media reports that questioned whether the discount airline employed more inexperienced pilots for lower salaries . one-two-go is one of about 40 low-cost airlines operating in asia , and the industry will be watching closely for the results of the investigation into the crash . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's andrew stevens contributed to this report .
31	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- prince harry led tributes to diana , princess of wales on the 10th anniversary of her death , describing her as `` the best mother in the world '' in a speech at a memorial service . here is his speech in full : . william and i can separate life into two parts . there were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father . princes harry and william greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother . and then there are the 10 years since our mother 's death . when she was alive , we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life , laughter , fun and folly . she was our guardian , friend and protector . she never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated . she will always be remembered for her amazing public work . but behind the media glare , to us , just two loving children , she was quite simply the best mother in the world . we would say that , would n't we . but we miss her . she kissed us last thing at night . her beaming smile greeted us from school . she laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day . she encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure . she -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood . to lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age , as others have experienced , is indescribably shocking and sad . it was an event which changed our lives forever , as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night . but what is far more important to us now , and into the future , is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was : fun-loving , generous , down-to-earth , entirely genuine . we both think of her every day . we speak about her and laugh together at all the memories . put simply , she made us , and so many other people , happy . may this be the way that she is remembered . prince william 's reading from st paul 's letter to the ephesians : . i bow my knees before the father , from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name . i pray that , according to the riches of his glory , he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit , and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith , as you are being rooted and grounded in love . i pray that you may have the power to comprehend , with all the saints , what is the breadth and length and height and depth , and to know the love of christ that surpasses knowledge , so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god . now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine , to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations , for ever and ever . amen . thanks be to god . the bishop of london 's speech : . `` who 's cheating ? '' the scene is an old people 's home . two residents are playing beggar my neighbor . enter the princess . the question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs . afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room . one tiny incident , characteristic of countless other occasions in the princess 's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort . everyone here will have their own memories . i remember meeting princess diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in st paul 's . even archbishop 's chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and i was nervous entering the presence . it must have been a bewildering time for the princess as well , but even then , at the age of 20 , her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated . prince harry has spoken movingly and justly , as few others have the right to do , about the princess as a mother . i want to dwell for a moment on her public work , its cost and its meaning . after her marriage , the princess joined her natural gifts of beauty , empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the royal family generates . led by our queen and other members of the royal family , our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century . there is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but does n't intrude , but there is another sphere , vital to any sense of national unity and creativity , a sphere in which communities must be celebrated , common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored . we tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is god 's will , but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in christ , the human face of god , then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society . and at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric , the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech , and the princess brought her own gifts to this work . she was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the middlesex hospital 's aids ward . it was the first in the uk and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded aids in the '80s . those familiar with the field have no doubt that the princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin . and she had a similar impact in the usa . an editorial in the new york times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign , and even a royal , dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the us . her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the ottawa convention , banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children . she proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which , of course , have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries . and as she said , in her words , `` the biggest disease today is not leprosy or tb but the feeling of being unwanted '' . she sought out places of suffering , because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed , and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way . bill deedes accompanied her on some of her visits . his response to the cynics was typically robust . he said : `` she was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well . she was good at this because she herself was vulnerable . she knew the feeling . she did n't set out to be a saint . '' the role brought great power but , like any member of the royal family , she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny . honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one 's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task . as we have heard from prince harry , his mother diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead . she confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched . she said of john , a young greek suffering from cystic fibrosis : `` he showed no sign of anger , no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that i have never before encountered . '' the love of christ described in the lesson read by prince william contains the essence of the spiritual life . princess diana recognized this quality of life in many of those , like john , whose lives she touched . it was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out . and the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself , the more you will become your true self ; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others , the more you will find yourself ; the more you keep company with those who suffer , the more you will be healed . this is the knowledge which passes all understanding . this is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints . it 's easy to lose the real person in the image , to insist that all is darkness or all is light . still , 10 years after her tragic death , there are regular reports of `` fury '' at this or that incident , and the princess 's memory is used for scoring points . let it end here . let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion . let us also , echoing the words of prince harry , look to the future and pray , in the words of st paul , for all those who serve our country as members of the royal family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her : . `` i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god .

32	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- allegations that blackwater usa -- whose operations were suspended after 20 iraqi civilians were shot to death last weekend -- was `` in any way associated or complicit in unlawful arms activities are baseless , '' the company asserted saturday . blackwater employees patrol baghdad by air in a february 2005 photograph . federal prosecutors are investigating allegations that employees of blackwater illegally purchased weapons and sold them in iraq , according to u.s. government sources . a u.s. government official has said the u.s. attorney 's office in raleigh , north carolina , is in the early stages of an investigation that focuses on individual company employees , and not the firm . blackwater , which is based in moyock , north carolina , is a security firm hired by the state department to guard u.s. staff in iraq . `` the company has no knowledge of any employee improperly exporting weapons , '' the blackwater statement said . `` when it was uncovered internally that two employees were stealing from the company , blackwater immediately fired them and invited the atf to conduct a thorough investigation . '' watch a report on blackwater 's response to the allegations '' the first public hint that an investigation was under way came earlier this week in a statement from state department inspector general howard krongard after he was accused of blocking fraud investigations in afghanistan and iraq . krongard said the state department has been cooperating with the prosecutors in the blackwater probe . `` in particular , i made one of my best investigators available to help assistant u.s. attorneys in north carolina in their investigation into alleged smuggling of weapons into iraq by a contractor , '' krongard 's statement said . blackwater resumed normal security operations in iraq on friday , the state department said , after a brief hiatus following the lethal incident last sunday . the iraqi government was outraged by the shootings and disputes the u.s. and blackwater 's claim that the guards were responding to an attack . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's elise labott and kelli arena contributed to this report .
33	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- filmmaker michael moore , whose new documentary `` sicko '' takes on america 's health care system , faced off tuesday with cnn chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon dr. sanjay gupta . michael moore and cnn 's sanjay gupta argued tuesday about gupta 's report on moore 's film `` sicko '' moore criticized a report gupta did on cnn monday on `` sicko . '' `` he said the facts were fudged , '' moore said , referring to gupta , on cnn 's `` larry king live . '' `` that 's a lie . none of the facts are fudged . '' moore and gupta shouted and argued over data gupta used and data moore used . moore said his staffers backed up the film 's facts to gupta before the report aired and that gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong . gupta disputed that . watch moore , gupta make their points '' `` we try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find , '' he said . `` michael has a lot of different numbers . ... you 're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports . '' both agreed , however , on the basic premise of `` sicko '' : problems abound in america 's health-care system and need to be fixed . `` i thought it was a good movie , and i wanted to say that , '' gupta said . `` i think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it 's broken . we get it . '' he praised moore for raising awareness of the issue . however , gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as france and canada have universal health care -- suggests that health care in those countries is free . while patients may not pay for services at the doctor 's office , they do pay high taxes to fund such a system , something gupta said he was concerned that `` sicko '' audiences might not realize . moore responded by saying americans pay more in copays , deductibles and insurance premiums . `` we -lsb- america -rsb- have a system built on profit , '' the moviemaker said . he asked gupta if the current system , which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures , is cumbersome to him . `` it 's a shameful system , especially when i 'm dealing with some of my patients , '' gupta said . but he questioned moore 's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the bush administration , which moore fiercely criticized in the past , particularly in his film `` fahrenheit 9/11 . '' `` the government actually used to do things right , '' moore said in response . `` the problem is who we put in power . '' moore has adamantly opposed the war in iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war 's success abounded in washington . `` i am sorry we 've taken so much time trying to correct -lsb- gupta 's -rsb- facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue '' -- the ailing health care system , moore said . e-mail to a friend .
34	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- french foreign minister bernard kouchner 's declaration that france had to prepare for the possibility of war against iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior . but then kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene . french foreign minister bernard kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority . a surprise appointment from the socialist ranks to nicolas sarkozy 's conservative government , the founder of medicins sans frontiers has always challenged convention and authority . the former un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali once called kouchner ` an unguided missile ' and the man himself has been known to declare : `` to change the law you sometimes have to break the law '' . he was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in france in may 1968 . kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot , with a strong commitment to human rights . unusually for a man of the left , he supported the us-led intervention in iraq -lrb- while criticizing the aftermath -rrb- . but he did so on the grounds of saddam hussein 's denial of human rights , not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction . his and president sarkozy 's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join gordon brown 's britain in a new push for action in darfur . bernard kouchner did not come to his position with any of former president chirac 's instinctive distrust of the united states . washington , which has been critical of some european states for their weakness in confronting teheran , will have been delighted by his ` get serious ' warning to teheran . but the plain-speaking kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the white house when he has criticisms to make of us policy . how much should be made of his words on iran remains unclear at this stage . they were scarcely on the same scale as president chirac 's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on france . but they are all of a piece with france 's new high-profile style under the presidency of nicolas sarkozy . mr kouchner , for example , became the first french foreign minister to visit iraq since 1988 , insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country 's problems , not a military one , and offering france 's services as a mediator and ` honest broker ' between sunnis , shiites and kurds . on iran he is , in a way , merely echoing the words of his president who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed iran would be ` unacceptable ' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as ` undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today ' . certainly mr kouchner is making clear that france no longer takes the view once expressed by president chirac that a nuclear-armed iran might be inevitable . in continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the west 's resolution on iran 's nuclear enrichment program mr kouchner is supplementing his president 's warnings . neither is saying that military intervention against iran is imminent or inevitable . neither has yet confirmed that france would be part of any such military action . but both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of teheran 's brinkmanship . perhaps the strongest lesson though from mr kouchner 's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in france is not a knee-jerk anti-american one -- and that france is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables . e-mail to a friend .

36	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious house resolution labeling turkey 's treatment of armenians in world war i as genocide . a kc-135 tanker lands at incirlik air base in southern turkey in 2003 . turkey , a longtime u.s. ally and nato partner , was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of armenians by ottoman turks genocide and threatened to block access to incirlik air base after the resolution passed a house committee vote . the base , in southern turkey near syria , is a major resupply center for u.s. operations in iraq and elsewhere in the mideast and asia . the pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in iraq if turkey cuts off u.s. access to the strategically important incirlik , military officials said tuesday . ankara acknowledges the killings of armenians during world war i but vehemently objects to the `` genocide '' label . the house foreign affairs committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution . house speaker nancy pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full house sometime next month . but the bush administration urged congress to drop the issue , and some leading democrats urged pelosi not to bring it to the floor . majority leader steny hoyer signaled tuesday that the vote might be put off . `` i said i thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here , '' said hoyer of maryland . `` i have not changed on that , although i would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions . we will have to determine where everybody is . '' democratic rep. ike skelton , the chairman of the house armed services committee , announced his opposition to the resolution last week . and democratic reps. alcee hastings of florida and john tanner of tennessee , both members of the u.s. house delegation to nato , urged pelosi to reconsider in a letter released tuesday . `` more than half of the cargo flown into iraq and afghanistan comes through incirlik air base , and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future , '' they wrote . lt. gen. carter ham , the director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff , said pentagon planners are looking at `` a broad range of options '' to keep food , fuel and ammunition flowing to u.s. troops in iraq if turkey blocks incirlik . `` we 're confident that we 'll find ways to do that , '' ham told reporters at the pentagon . `` there 's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that , and obviously we 'd prefer to maintain the access that we have . '' defense secretary robert gates echoed lawmakers ' concerns last week . `` about 70 percent of all air cargo going into iraq goes through turkey . ... about a third of the fuel that they consume goes through turkey or comes from turkey , '' gates said . he also said that 95 percent of the mine-resistant ambush-protective vehicles , or mraps , being deployed in iraq are flown through turkey . the vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs . see incirlik 's key location '' the u.s. military issued a `` warning order '' a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews , planes , fuel and routes are lined up if turkey stops or restricts u.s. access to incirlik , a source said . jordan and kuwait are among the alternatives the united states is considering . some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the turks to attack kurdish rebels in northern iraq which could further complicate iraqi stability , u.s. officials said . incirlik offers 10,000 - and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters , according globalsecurity.org , a source of background information about military issues . globalsecurity said incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to iraq , taking over for rhein-main air base in germany because it is closer to iraq , reducing the strain on troops and aircraft . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's barbara starr and deirdre walsh contributed to this report .
37	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates , interest groups , unions and corporations to buy tv time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle , an analysis shows . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney has spent the most on tv advertising so far among presidential contenders . the cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $ 3 billion , according to tns media intelligence/campaign media analysis group , cnn 's consultant on political television advertising . this is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $ 1.7 billion . in 2006 , $ 2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy tv commercials . just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money , said evan tracey , cmag 's chief operating officer . the costs to produce a tv commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates , who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters . see how spending breaks down for this year '' and interest groups have spent $ 6.2 million on tv ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures . on the national level , the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $ 270 million in the first nine months of this year . subjects ranged from the iraq war to telecommunications reform . television ads on health care alone total $ 60 million . cmag estimates more than $ 3 million of the $ 270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive house and senate races in 2008 . tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups `` pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode . '' `` what we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries , and through the general election , is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates , '' he said . with 17 democratic and republican candidates running for president , cmag predicts that more than $ 800 million will be spent on tv ads in the battle for the white house . up to now , the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of iowa , new hampshire and south carolina . voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on february 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney leads all candidates in tv spending , having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $ 8.6 million . this is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle . watch how romney is way ahead in ad spending '' in contrast , one of romney 's chief rivals for the gop nomination , former new york mayor rudy giuliani , has spent nothing on television ads , but giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys . giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition , while romney does not . in the race for the democratic nomination , illinois sen. barack obama has spent more than $ 2.3 million on television commercials , while new york sen. hillary clinton has spent $ 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls . new mexico gov. bill richardson has probably benefited the most in the democratic contest from the $ 2 million he has invested in his television commercials . richardson 's humorous tv ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker , diplomat and executive , and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate . romney used his $ 8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to republican voters . these voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal massachusetts . romney is leading polls in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire . further evidence of how romney 's television commercials have helped is in south carolina . an american research group poll of south carolina republicans in august showed romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters . a month later , and with $ 350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll , romney was up 17 percentage points . romney 's latest ad began airing friday in iowa , and in it he vows to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , to boost the military by 100,000 people , to strengthen u.s. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the u.s. from al qaeda . all of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the iowa caucuses . while only a handful of democratic candidates and romney have used the airwaves until now , tracey said he expects this to change . `` before the end of october , i suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air , '' tracey said . `` as we get closer to primary day , the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last , best shot . '' in the fight for congress , cmag predicts that as much as $ 639 million could be spent on television advertising . democrats control the house and senate . tracey noted that cmag 's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former florida rep. mark foley 's house page scandal or the september 11 terrorist attacks . `` politics is completely beholden to events , '' he said . `` events will ultimately determine how much is spent , where and when . '' what television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months ? `` chances are , just as what happened in 2006 , voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads , '' said stuart rothenberg , editor of the non-partisan rothenberg political report . `` the sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance . after a while , the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise .

'' patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes . there had never been any doubt she would win , given support from the ruling coalition . the governor of the northwestern desert state of rajasthan , she emerged on the national stage when the congress-led coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate . `` this is a very special moment for us women , and men of course , in our country because for the first time we have a woman being elected president of india , '' congress party leader sonia gandhi , india 's most powerful politician , said . supporters hoped patil 's candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in india , like dowry-related violence , into the public spotlight . a woman is murdered , raped or abused every three minutes on average in india . her presidency also reflects the growing power of some women in india , where an increasing number are taking part in the workforce and in schools and hold senior positions in corporations . after the results , patil supporters took to the streets , singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums . india has had a number of female icons in the past -- most famously sonia gandhi 's mother-in-law , indira , who was one of the world 's first female prime ministers in 1966 . but hope patil 's presidency would spark only positive talk about women 's influence in india evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003 because of bad debts and amid accusations of financial irregularities . the employees ' union has taken patil and others to court , claiming loans meant for poor women were instead given to her brother and other relatives and not returned . she was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry . prime minister manmohan singh , who has dismissed accusations against her as `` mud-slinging '' , said on saturday her victory was `` a vote against the politics of divisiveness '' . `` all the allegations against me are motivated and have already been answered , '' patil said in a statement last week . her campaign was marked by other mishaps as well . she managed to offend many minority muslims , and anger some historians , by saying indian women first veiled their heads as protection against 16th century muslim invaders . then she dismayed modern india by claiming she had experienced a `` divine premonition '' that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru . critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as maharashtra 's health minister in 1975 , saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
39	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- explorer dennis schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near greenland . fishermen pass by greenland 's ilulissat fjord in this september 2004 picture . such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity , even wonder perhaps , but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer . the island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier . but such a large amount of ice melted , it revealed the distinct island . `` i very quickly realized two things , '' he told cnn 's anderson cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year . `` one -lsb- was -rsb- that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change . '' `` the other thing was that it meant it was really happening . it was n't a joke . it was n't just statistics . it was really happening . '' he calls his discovery warming island . many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the earth 's climate are the result of an increase in the world 's temperature , a trend widely called global warming . many global warming experts say the phenomenon , if unchecked , is capable of altering the world 's climate and geography . in the worst-case scenario , experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels , flooding cities and altering seashores . other scientists and observers , a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous , say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet 's life . most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere . but why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious . the earth 's temperature averages about 60 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- about 16 degrees celsius -rrb- . the average surface temperature has warmed one degree fahrenheit -lrb- 0.6 degrees celsius -rrb- during the last century , according to the national research council . the temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910 , according to the u.s. environmental protection agency . they rose till about 1945 , cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day . there are several possible reasons for the warming , scientists say . a change in the earth 's orbit or the intensity of the sun 's radiation could change , triggering warming or cooling . the reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases , which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet 's temperature at a comfortable level . the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , for instance , has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age , according to the united nations ' intergovernmental panel on climate change , commonly referred to as the ipcc . the presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels , but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades , according to the epa . meanwhile , nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years . many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities , like the burning of fossil fuels , emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests . `` for the last 30 years , there 's no way there 's anything natural that can explain it , '' stephen schneider , a professor of environmental studies at stanford university in california , said . `` a vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming , '' he added . many scientific organizations share schneider 's view , ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the g8 to the national research council , the american meteorological society and the american geophysical union . but there are those who do not share his view , and among the skeptics is richard lindzen , a professor of atmospheric sciences at the massachusetts institute of technology . `` we 've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves , '' he said . `` when we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970 , we were proclaiming global cooling . since then , there 's been a few tenths of global warming , so we 're proclaiming global warming . '' he believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability , where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal . `` the earth is always getting colder and warmer , '' he said . `` it 's always changing . in fact , this is true of any fluid-covered planet . '' asked about glacial melt , which many observers point to as evidence of global warming , lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained . `` we do n't know why , but it 's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they 've occurred , '' he said . `` what we 're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that 's occurring due to global warming . '' yet , for schneider , it is a cause for concern and alarm . `` we 're already in serious melt , nobody can explain it . the models do n't predict it , '' he said . `` we do n't know what 's going on up there . all we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty . '' the greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world 's nations . the ipcc in february 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels , temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 2 to 4.5 degrees celsius -rrb- by 2100 . the lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes , droughts , wildfires and flooding , schneider said . the higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of hollywood filmmakers . uncertainties , however , plague such forecasts , which are based on computer simulations and models . the models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere , oceans and continents interact , all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them . `` exactly how much it 's going to warm up , we do n't know , '' schneider said . `` that it 's going to warm up ? i 'd bet anything on that .

40	abeche , chad -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- most of the 103 children that a french charity attempted to take to france from chad for adoption are neither sudanese nor orphans , three international aid agencies reported on thursday . hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-french slogans wednesday in abeche , chad . six members of zoe 's ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to france , where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in . three french journalists , a seven-member spanish flight crew and one belgian were also arrested . representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with zoe 's ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission . chadian president idriss deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed , his chief of staff , mahamat hissene , said thursday . the president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of abeche , where the children were taken , to a judge in n'djamena , the capital , hissene said . the transfer will take place monday , according to media reports . the international red cross committee , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees and unicef said most of the children were living with their families before zoe 's ark took them . the charity said the children were sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation . the agencies said most of the children also probably come from chadian villages along chad 's border with sudan . the children have been living in an orphanage in abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities . watch a report on whether the children are orphans '' chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities . chad 's interior minister said zoe 's ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help . the charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted . the spaniards and belgian are charged with complicity . the spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released , a company executive said thursday . `` we thought we were doing a humanitarian transport , '' said antoni cajal , sales director of spain 's gir jet charter firm . `` if an ngo -lsb- nongovernmental organization -rsb- has done something wrong , it 's impossible for us to know . '' spain 's foreign ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to chad to try to win the group 's release . over the weekend , the captain appealed urgently to be rescued , fearing the crew could be harmed or killed , cajal said . but the four women and three men are in good condition in custody , cajal said , based on his conversations with a spanish consular official who came from cameroon to chad and has been able to visit them . the detention is the first problem of its kind for the company , which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue , cajal said . on its web site , zoe 's ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in paris that sends teams of physicians , nurses , firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in france , who then apply for asylum on their behalf . the red cross , unhcr and unicef said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10 , and they are healthy . the agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds . `` so far , the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from chadian villages near the cities of adre and tine along the chadian-sudanese border , '' the agencies said . `` ninety-one children said they had been living with their family , consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent , '' the agencies said , adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing . the agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children , their youth and the situation in the region . other french charities earlier had questioned whether zoe 's ark could legally arrange adoption of children from darfur , and contacted french authorities , according to french newspapers and the associated press . french authorities have reacted angrily to the zoe 's ark trip , calling the group 's actions `` illegal and irresponsible . '' the french foreign ministry has said the dispute will not affect france 's participation in a european peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between chad and sudan . in response to the dispute in chad , the republic of congo said late wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions , the associated press reported . reporters without borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in chad . the organization said photographers marc garmirian of the capa news agency and jean-daniel guillou of the synchro x agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity 's efforts . the third journalist , marie-agnes peleran of the tv station france 3 miditerranee , was traveling with the group in a personal capacity , though she carried a camera from her station , reporters without borders said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's al goodman contributed to this report . copyright 2007 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .
41	san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- more than 100 homes in an upscale san diego community were evacuated after a landslide about 60 yards wide pulled the earth from beneath a three-lane road and some of the multimillion-dollar homes that adorn it . gina yarbrough sent this picture of the road that collapsed in wednesday 's landslide . mayor jerry sanders declared a state of emergency , asking california and the federal government to help the la jolla community recover from the wednesday landslide . as of thursday morning , he had already received offers of aid from legislators , the governor 's office and the white house , he said . officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along soledad mountain road . holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift , which earlier ruptured a water line , and according to some media reports , began cracking soledad mountain road in july . on wednesday , a 20-foot-deep chasm opened beneath the road and homes . holli weld told san diego 's kgtv that she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed . watch a resident recall how he had to grab his dogs and run '' `` the street was sinking before our eyes , '' she said . authorities told kgtv that most residents were at work and only seven people were in their homes when the landslide occurred . evacuated homeowner russell moore told cnn he remembers hearing the earth `` groan '' in what he called a `` slow avalanche .

47	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- after weeks of controversy over michael mukasey 's views on waterboarding , the senate late thursday approved the former judge 's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote . waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of president bush 's nominee to lead the justice department . president bush nominated mukasey to replace longtime ally alberto gonzales , who resigned in september . the nomination had been considered at risk after a number of democratic senators opposed mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . mukasey , a former federal judge in new york , told senators he considers waterboarding `` repugnant , '' but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture , which u.s. and international law bans . waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning . mukasey 's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key democrats on the senate judiciary committee -- sens. dianne feinstein of california and chuck schumer of new york -- said they would vote in favor of mukasey despite the controversy . `` the department of justice , once the crown jewel among government institutions , is adrift and rudderless , '' schumer said tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send mukasey 's nomination to the senate floor . `` it desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and i believe judge mukasey is that person . '' schumer said that in a meeting friday the nominee said that congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president `` would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore '' it . schumer said he believed mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general . `` indeed , his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president 's previous attorney general nominees have . '' but mukasey 's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with sen. patrick leahy , d-vermont , the judiciary committee 's chairman . `` some have sought to find comfort in judge mukasey 's personal assurance that he would enforce a future , new law against waterboarding if this congress were to pass one , '' leahy said tuesday . `` unsaid , of course , is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president . '' however , the committee 's ranking republican , sen. arlen specter of pennsylvania , said he believed mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding . `` he could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances , '' specter said earlier . `` but he is intelligent ; he 's really learned in the law . he 's strong , ethical , honest beyond any question . he 's not an intimate of the president . '' a majority of americans consider waterboarding a form of torture , but some of those say it 's ok for the u.s. government to use the technique , according to a poll released tuesday . asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture , more than two-thirds of respondents , or 69 percent , said yes ; 29 percent said no . asked whether they think the u.s. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists , 58 percent said no ; 40 percent said yes . the cnn/opinion research corp. telephone poll of 1,024 american adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . e-mail to a friend .
48	mogadishu , somalia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- an enraged crowd dragged the body of an ethiopian soldier through the streets of somalia 's capital thursday after gun battles with islamic insurgents killed 19 people , witnesses reported . in a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving somali militias in which the bodies of u.s. troops were dragged through the streets , crowds thursday shouted `` god is great '' as they pulled the bruised , bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty mogadishu neighborhood . the body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern mogadishu neighborhood of suqa holaha , witnesses reported . nine ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead . another battle broke out on the city 's south side thursday morning between ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades . the fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes , on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks . `` ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us , for some of their comrades have been killed today , '' said rahma nor omar , an elderly woman in the capital . `` they will be like wounded animals . '' witnesses put the death toll from the day 's clashes at 19 , including ethiopian troops , insurgents and civilians . ethiopian troops arrived in somalia in december 2006 to help a weak somali government drive the islamic courts union out of mogadishu and restore a u.n.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy . the islamists responded by launching an insurgency against somali government and ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year . the united states accused the icu of harboring suspected al qaeda figures , including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of u.s. embassies in tanzania and kenya , and raised no objections to ethiopian presence in somalia . washington has long been concerned that somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists , but icu leaders denied harboring al qaeda suspects . e-mail to a friend .
49	bolingbrook , illinois -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the disappearance of a suburban chicago police sergeant 's wife is now being treated as a potential homicide , and her husband is a suspect , authorities said friday . stacy peterson , 23 , has been missing from her suburban chicago home since october 28 . in another development , a judge signed an order to exhume the body of drew peterson 's third wife , who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004 , said will county state attorney james glasgow . peterson , 53 , said he last spoke to 23-year-old stacy peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of october 28 . drew peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man , but he has n't repeated that accusation . cnn has been unable to contact drew peterson for comment . the couple have been married four years and have two children , who have been interviewed for the investigation , glasgow said . drew peterson also has older children from a previous marriage . investigators have twice searched the couple 's home and vehicles , and removed several items , including computers , said illinois state police capt. carl dobrich . drew peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing , but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time , dobrich said . `` early on , we looked at this as a missing persons case , but also believed strongly ... it was strongly starting to look at drew peterson as being a person of interest , '' dobrich said . `` i would say that right now , drew peterson has gone from being a person of interest to being a suspect . '' new information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of peterson 's third wife , kathleen savio , which was ruled an accident by a coroner 's jury , glasgow said . `` there are strong indications that it was a homicide , '' he said . `` that 's why we are doing the exhumation , because there are tests that need to be done that were n't done during the first autopsy . '' watch why authorities want to exhume the body '' glasgow cited abrasions on savio 's body and a gash on her head that could not be readily explained . `` our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide , and as we do that , we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone , '' he said . glasgow , who was not state attorney at the time of savio 's death , said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case . `` with 29 years of experience , there was no doubt in my mind it was n't an accident , '' he said . `` that was clear . '' in 2002 , savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband , but was found not guilty at trial , glasgow said . another time , she tried to bring domestic battery charges against peterson , but no charges were ever filed . savio 's sister , sue doman , said savio expressed fear of drew peterson . `` she told me all the time , ` he 's gon na kill me . it 's gon na look like an accident , ' '' doman said . doman said she did n't believe her sister could have died in the way the investigation concluded . `` i do n't understand accidental drowning . you just do n't drown in the bathtub , especially a small whirlpool . you just do n't do that , '' she said . meanwhile , friends and family of stacy peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband . a friend , steve cesare , has told cnn he received e-mail from her describing her relationship as abusive . the woman 's aunt , candace aikin , of el monte , california , said stacy peterson confided in her that there were problems during a visit to the peterson home in suburban chicago last month . `` she said that she was afraid because he was following her around 24/7 , even inside the house , '' aikin said . `` he was very obsessed and stalking her , even inside her house . she was very , very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all , '' aikin said . e-mail to a friend .
50	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- china has suspended exports of the aqua dots toys contaminated with a chemical that can convert to a powerful `` date rape '' drug , the state-run xinhua news agency reported saturday . the toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness . china suspended exports of the aqua dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a `` date rape '' drug . the agency said that the general administration of quality supervision , inspection , and quarantine -lrb- aqsiq -rrb- has ordered an investigation by quality control agencies and will release results as soon as they are available . the aqsiq did not reveal the name of the toys ' producer , xinhua said . u.s. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the chinese-made toys wednesday . scientists have found the highly popular holiday toy contains a chemical that , once metabolized , converts into the toxic `` date rape '' drug ghb -lrb- gamma-hydroxy butyrate -rrb- , scott wolfson , a spokesman with the u.s. consumer product safety commission -lrb- cpsc -rrb- , told cnn . `` children who swallow the beads can become comatose , develop respiratory depression or have seizures , '' a cpsc statement warned . the arts-and-craft beads , which have been selling since april at major u.s. retail stores under the name `` aqua dots , '' have also been distributed in australia under the name `` bindeez beads . '' the bindeez toys were recalled tuesday by melbourne-based moose enterprise pty. ltd. after three children in australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized . `` i was so frightened because i thought she was n't going to make it , '' heather lehane told cnn affiliate network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter , charlotte , who was hospitalized in australia after ingesting some of the beads . in the united states , the washington-based safety commission said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads , which are part of a craft kit aimed at kids 4 years and older . the cpsc said a boy nearly 2 years old `` swallowed several dozen beads . he became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time . '' the commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since `` fully recovered . '' the second incident involved a child who vomited , fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days . it was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery . toronto-based toy distributor spin master ltd. stopped shipping the aqua dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves , where they were previously sold for $ 17 to $ 30 . anyone with aqua dots at home should return the product to the company , cpsc spokeswoman julie vallese said . the toy had been named toy of the year in australia and recently crested wal-mart 's list of top 12 christmas toys . wal-mart on thursday listed the toys on its web site as `` out of stock online '' and had removed them from their top toy list as well . this latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of chinese-made toys that have swept across the country . last month alone , u.s. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint , which can cause hazardous lead poisoning . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's janine brady , jason carroll , laura dolan , julie o'neill and leslie wiggins contributed to this report .
51	johannesburg , south africa -- south african fast bowler dale steyn took a career-best five for 34 as the proteas took a tight grip on the first test against new zealand in johannesburg . steyn 's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests . new zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to south africa 's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings . hashim amla and jacques kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as south africa stretched their lead to 287 . south africa 's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings . they snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the kiwis could only muster 56 runs . former new zealand captain stephen fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap ross taylor 's 15 . fleming was struck on the right forearm by steyn and did not field during the afternoon . coach john bracewell said he had gone for precautionary x-rays but there was only bruising . new zealand , 41 for two overnight , lost nightwatchman shane bond , bowled by a steyn yorker , before makhaya ntini claimed the crucial wicket of fleming , who was well caught by ab de villiers diving to his left at third slip . scott styris and taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled . steyn 's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at centurion two seasons ago . it was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests . ntini took three for 47 and kallis two for 11 . south africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers herschelle gibbs and captain graeme smith out cheaply , but amla and kallis blunted the attack and then took charge . they batted together for 205 minutes , amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76 . the kiwis were left to regret brendon mccullum 's failure to hold a chance from amla off shane bond , when the batsman had only scored two . `` the ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum . it cost us a lot , '' said coach john bracewell . e-mail to a friend .

'' she repeats several times , making sure the message is clear and waving away jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion . dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground . harb wants the cnn crew to see how many iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating . this school year , she says , 145 students are iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 iraqi children on a waiting list . watch iraqi girls describe a long way from home '' the reason behind the jump in the number of iraqis at the school is a new government policy : for the first time since the start of the iraq war , jordan is allowing all iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools . simply , this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked . the move is cementing a massive population shift in the middle east . more than 2.2 million iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland , most of them seeking refuge in neighboring jordan and syria , according to humanitarian officials . jordanian minister of education khalid touqan says he expects jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 iraqi students this year . that 's more than double the number of iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago . harb , on the front line of the phenomenon , says the influx is putting a strain on her school . even with some u.n. and u.s. aid to jordan , there 's still not enough money . `` we need more teachers here , more resources , more buildings , more chairs for all iraqi students and our students , '' she says . in a nearby neighborhood , in the study room of the ahmed toukan school for boys , a handful of iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home . seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth , the boys tell stories of horror and displacement . eighteen-year-old qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to jordan to try to live a normal life . matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare , he repeats the number : `` five members . '' most of the boys and young men from iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation , but also their entry into the workforce . all say , though , that they feel lucky to have gotten out , even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move , ready to live far from home and away from loved ones . `` it 's not strange for me to be in the middle of people i do n't know , '' says eleventh grader ziad tarek al shamsi . `` i had friends in iraq when i was small , i left them . in america , i left them . i came here , i left them . '' he pauses : `` but you have to miss your country . '' the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age iraqi children are in jordan . many of them are enrolled in private institutions . but as families run out of money they had when they left iraq , they turn to public schools . even so , more than a month into the new academic year , fewer iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year . according to the charity save the children , 21,000 iraqi children have so far enrolled in jordanian classrooms . as a result , the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for iraqi families . the lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees ' fears of being identified through their children 's school records . regardless of what the final number will be this year , the population shift in the middle east is , according to unhcr head antonio guterres , the largest urban refugee situation in the world . iraqi families are changing the social fabric of jordanian society . about 10 percent of jordan 's population is now made up of iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them . the schoolchildren are living examples of how the iraq war may permanently change the middle east . `` iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education , '' says touqan , the education minister . `` we will not run a parallel system of education .

57	amman , jordan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in the sunbathed schoolyard of the shmisani institute for girls in amman , jordan , principal sanaa abu harb makes an announcement over the speaker system . iraqi students at the shmisani school in amman gather around a teacher . one in 5 students there is iraqi . `` all iraqi girls come outside now . all iraqi girls . iraqi girls only ! '' she repeats several times , making sure the message is clear and waving away jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion . dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground . harb wants the cnn crew to see how many iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating . this school year , she says , 145 students are iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 iraqi children on a waiting list . watch iraqi girls describe a long way from home '' the reason behind the jump in the number of iraqis at the school is a new government policy : for the first time since the start of the iraq war , jordan is allowing all iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools . simply , this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked . the move is cementing a massive population shift in the middle east . more than 2.2 million iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland , most of them seeking refuge in neighboring jordan and syria , according to humanitarian officials . jordanian minister of education khalid touqan says he expects jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 iraqi students this year . that 's more than double the number of iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago . harb , on the front line of the phenomenon , says the influx is putting a strain on her school . even with some u.n. and u.s. aid to jordan , there 's still not enough money . `` we need more teachers here , more resources , more buildings , more chairs for all iraqi students and our students , '' she says . in a nearby neighborhood , in the study room of the ahmed toukan school for boys , a handful of iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home . seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth , the boys tell stories of horror and displacement . eighteen-year-old qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to jordan to try to live a normal life . matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare , he repeats the number : `` five members . '' most of the boys and young men from iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation , but also their entry into the workforce . all say , though , that they feel lucky to have gotten out , even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move , ready to live far from home and away from loved ones . `` it 's not strange for me to be in the middle of people i do n't know , '' says eleventh grader ziad tarek al shamsi . `` i had friends in iraq when i was small , i left them . in america , i left them . i came here , i left them . '' he pauses : `` but you have to miss your country . '' the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age iraqi children are in jordan . many of them are enrolled in private institutions . but as families run out of money they had when they left iraq , they turn to public schools . even so , more than a month into the new academic year , fewer iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year . according to the charity save the children , 21,000 iraqi children have so far enrolled in jordanian classrooms . as a result , the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for iraqi families . the lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees ' fears of being identified through their children 's school records . regardless of what the final number will be this year , the population shift in the middle east is , according to unhcr head antonio guterres , the largest urban refugee situation in the world . iraqi families are changing the social fabric of jordanian society . about 10 percent of jordan 's population is now made up of iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them . the schoolchildren are living examples of how the iraq war may permanently change the middle east . `` iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education , '' says touqan , the education minister . `` we will not run a parallel system of education .

58	patuakhali , bangladesh -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones monday as they waited for aid to arrive . villagers grieve in patargata , around 125 miles south of dhaka , capital of bangladesh , monday . the number of dead killed from cyclone sidr -- now at 3,114 -- is expected to rise yet further as the south asian nation continues to assess the damage . the bangladesh red crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000 . in the fishing village of galachipa , in patuakhali district , dhalan mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities . `` nothing is going to happen . that was our first thought and we went to bed . just before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons . our small hut was swept away like a piece of paper , and we all ran for shelter , '' mridha , a 45-year-old farm worker , told the associated press . on the way to a shelter , mridha lost contact with his wife , mother and two children . the next morning he found their bodies . the category 4 cyclone raked bangladesh 's southwest coast on thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 km/h -lrb- 150 mph -rrb- , destroying fishermen 's hamlets and villages . thousands are still missing , while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm . many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them . most houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron , and had no chance of withstanding the storm 's powerful winds . in addition , the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as sidr pushed through , wiping out many villages and littering the river 's shores with debris . watch as people are left to fend for themselves '' low-lying bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the country 's rice production -- a major food staple for the impoverished country . improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991 , when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands . bangladesh president iajuddin ahmed visited the devastated region sunday , handing out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media . it was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left empty-handed and furious . security officials struggled to hold back the crowd . see dramatic photos of storm survivors '' sidr has already ruined bangladesh 's rice harvest , but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past . nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country 's rice production in 1974 . international aid organizations promised initial packages of $ 25 million during a meeting with bangladesh agencies monday , the u.n. 's world food program said . the united states has offered more than $ 2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief , and sent two u.s. navy carriers to help in recovery operations . in addition , the u.s. agency for international development -lrb- usaid -rrb- is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person department of defense medical team is in bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm . bangladesh 's government held an emergency cabinet meeting saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues , bangladeshi government spokesman fahim munaim told cnn . officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions can not yet be determined . munaim said nearly a third of bangladesh 's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone , most of those along the southern coast . the bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced . international aid groups -- including save the children , world vision , and the red crescent , which already have offices in bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions . roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm , or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use . clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process . along the broken road that leads into kolapara , the body of an 8-year-old girl called rummie was carefully carried away for burial . overwhelmed with sadness , her mother khadija was steadied by a relative . `` i am feeling too much pain in my heart , '' she said . `` i have lost my daughter , so i am a victim of the cyclone as well .

59	glasgow , scotland -- world champions italy clinched qualification for euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 2-1 victory at hampden park -- killing off scotland 's hopes of reaching the finals . luca toni celebrates his early goal as italy won 2-1 in scotland to clinch qualification from group b. luca toni shot italy in front but scotland recovered to dominate and barry ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller . however , christian panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award italy a free-kick . the result also means france have sealed qualification , along with italy , from group b without playing a game . in a match played in torrential rain , italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds . gianluca zambrotta spotted antonio di natale unmarked in the box , and picked him out with a throw-in as scotland were caught napping . di natale swept the ball into the path of toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out . the home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later . this time , toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by mauro camoranesi who fired over from close-range . toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from craig gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post . at the other end , scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from lee mcculloch appeared to be handled by zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored . spurred on by a sense of injustice , the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors . ferguson fired over from a james mcfadden corner , before alan hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the everton man . scotland then produced some wonderful passing football , which culminated in a tight-angled drive from ferguson , but gianluigi buffon dived low to smother . then came another scare for the home side . gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from massimo ambrosini , before di natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net . the assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong . only last-gasp defending from the italians prevented the scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time . david weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet ferguson 's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before andrea pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line . a free-kick in a dangerous area provided italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when paul hartley hauled down camoranesi just outside the box . pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but , despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist , his effort was easily dealt with by gordon . instead , it was scotland who found the back of the net as hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone . mcfadden 's free-kick deflected into the path of mcculloch in front of goal . he was denied by buffon , but the rebound fell kindly to ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range . with just over 15 minutes to go , scott brown was withdrawn for kenny miller as scotland went for broke . the derby striker quickly began to cause the italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of mcfadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score . scotland 's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for euro 2008 . hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and panucci rose to meet pirlo 's cross and nod home the winner . italy coach roberto donadoni said : `` we knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere . `` but through their character and desire , the lads were fantastic . they worked so hard , they deserve this . qualifying for euro 2008 is amazing . it 's something positive after all that happened last week -lrb- the death of the lazio fan -rrb- . '' captain fabio cannavaro : `` this was a victory won with the heart . it was difficult to play in this stadium , with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron . `` we played really well and managed to win . we showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions . `` in italy we play a high level of football , we 've won the champions league and the world cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else .

60	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- 1 . the spam ® museum . spam marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the chinese year of the pig . if the on-site `` wall of spam '' is any indication , a tour through the spam museum in austin , minnesota , is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family . spam 's parent company , hormel foods , opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of spam . one of the main attractions is a scale model of a spam plant , where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce america 's favorite tinned meat . 2 . national museum of funeral history . it 's pretty hard to argue with the motto `` any day above ground is a good one . '' so goes the backhanded optimism of the national museum of funeral history , a houston facility that opened in 1992 . visitors are treated to exhibits that include a civil war embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory . in addition , the museum boasts an exhibit of `` fantasy coffins '' designed by ghanaian artist kane quaye . these moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken , a mercedes-benz , a shallot , and an outboard motor . according to quaye , his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients , which -- let 's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot . 3 . the hobo museum . if you 're bumming around but looking for a good time , be sure to take a load off in britt , iowa , at the hobo museum , which details the history and culture of tramps . bear in mind , though , that the museum kind of , well , slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual hobo convention . luckily , tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year . of course , if you 're interested in the hobo convention , lodging is available all over the area , but it 's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the `` hobo jungle , '' located by the railroad tracks . both the event and the museum are operated by the hobo foundation , which -- incidentally -- also oversees the nearby hobo cemetery , where those who have `` caught the westbound '' are laid to rest . 4 . the mütter museum . originally , the college of physicians of philadelphia erected the mütter museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena . -lrb- you know , babies with two heads , that sort of thing . -rrb- . but today , it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque . there , you 'll find the world 's largest colon , removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation . also on display : an ob-gyn instrument collection , thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens , and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects . 5 . the barnum museum . what better way to honor `` greatest show on earth '' founder p.t. barnum than with a mediocre museum in bridgeport , connecticut ? some visitors will appreciate the museum 's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus . but only circus freaks -lrb- and by that we mean `` enthusiasts '' -rrb- will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of barnum 's 40-inch-tall sidekick , general tom thumb . 6 . the conspiracy museum . there 's more than one theory about the assassination of john f. kennedy , so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well ? most jfk buffs are familiar with the sixth floor museum housed in the former texas school book depository , which recounts all those boring `` mainstream '' details of the late president 's life leading up to his death at the hands of lee harvey oswald . but just down the street , the conspiracy museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into the man 's propaganda . for the most part , the museum specializes in showings of the zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories , including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement . 7 . the museum of questionable medical devices . take two trips to the museum of questionable medical devices and call us when you 've lost all faith in the medical profession . thanks to curator bob mccoy -lrb- who recently donated the collection to the science museum of minnesota -rrb- , those in search of history 's quack science can find what they 're looking for in the st. paul tourist attraction , whether it 's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers . if you make the trip , be sure to check out the 1930s mcgregor rejuvenator . this clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies , sans head , in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process . 8 . cook 's natural science museum . what began as a training facility for cook 's pest control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest . at cook 's natural science museum in decatur , alabama , visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats , cockroaches , mice , spiders , and termites ... all for free . and while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them , museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing pest of the month keep reeling in patrons . 9 . vent haven ventriloquist museum . so , what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville ? the vent haven ventriloquist museum , of course -- where dummies go to die . the fort mitchell , kentucky , museum was the brainchild of the late william shakespeare berger , who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets . in fact , he collected figures from some of the country 's most famous ventriloquist acts . and with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling , you 're bound to feel like you 're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one . but sadly , when berger gave the tour , you could totally tell his mouth was moving . 10 . the trash museum . mom was n't kidding when she said one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . at the trash museum in hartford , connecticut , the connecticut resources recovery authority -lrb- crra -rrb- turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment ! t . our the temple of trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump . and for your recycler-in-training , head across the state to the children 's garbage museum , where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile , get a glimpse of the 1-ton trash-o-saurus , or enjoy the company of resident compost worms . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

63	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- attacks are down 75 percent in recent months in a perilous stretch of neighborhoods in northeastern baghdad , prompting a u.s. military officer to proclaim monday that security there is `` dramatically improving . '' concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of baghdad , a military official says . people line the streets , cars congest them , trash collectors and other city workers have returned , local leaders are holding community meetings again and `` markets have come back like gangbusters , '' said army col. don farris , commander of 2nd brigade combat team , 82nd airborne division . he added that the largely sunni al qaeda in iraq presence has been `` crushed '' since the beginning of may . however , there are still dangers , most notably the threats posed by iranian-backed shiite militants , farris said . speaking to pentagon reporters via video link from baghdad , farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation . among them is the `` surge , '' the additional u.s. troops deployed earlier this year . watch how old rivalries have been posing problems '' also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr 's mehdi army and the development of a program that employs `` concerned local citizens '' to assist u.s. and iraqi forces , farris said . some of those citizens are members of local sunni `` awakening councils , '' comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area . especially in the last six weeks , farris said , civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests , two iranian operatives among them . `` from my foxhole , in our sector , it is working , '' he said of the improving security in the area . `` i can only speak to what i see in my sector and i am encouraged . '' farris ' sector -- which includes the sunni-dominated district of adhamiya and sadr city , the shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a `` remarkable turnaround , '' he said . many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads . despite improvements in the security situation , farris warned that `` we still have a lot of work to do '' because there does n't appear to be any sign that shiite extremists with links to iran are halting their activities . farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators , which are often delivered or manufactured by iran . nine such bombs were found in late october , he said . there are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into sadr city , he said . there are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area , farris said , because `` essential services '' like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff . though a `` trickle '' of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return , farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape . paul folmsbee , a state department provincial reconstruction team leader , said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law , governance , economic development and essential services . farris ' monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by u.s. and iraqi military officials over recent weeks . the military officials say they are seeing signs of sunni-shiite reconciliation . at a press conference earlier monday in baghdad , brig. gen. ed cardon , deputy commander for support of multi-national division-center , discussed a `` definite period of progress '' in his region on the southern baghdad outskirts . e-mail to a friend .

67	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- they say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing . but not for these folks ! long before the material girl ordered papa to stop preaching , these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose . alfred hitchcock did n't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors . here 's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form . alfred hitchcock . hitchcock was , without question , one of the towering geniuses of cinema . and , like many greats , he was n't exactly the best collaborator . hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters , who felt he never properly credited them for their work . but he was notoriously hard on actors . he was once quoted as saying , `` actors are cattle '' -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry -lrb- actors can be so touchy -rrb- . in response , he issued this correction : `` i have been misquoted . what i really said is , ` actors should be treated as cattle . ' '' although it began accidentally -lrb- when he was short an actor for the film `` the lodger '' -rrb- , hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films , amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career . ayn rand . the egotist 's egotist , author ayn rand -lrb- born alissa zinovievna rosenbaum -rrb- is the patron saint of thinking you 're better than everybody else . her most famous novels , the fountainhead and atlas shrugged , are massive dramatizations of objectivism , her self-spun oscar-the-grouch philosophy for success . objectivism champions ego and accomplishment , shuns all religion as folly , and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society . rand 's novels often focus on protagonists -lrb- invariably men -rrb- who are shunned by others because of their genius , but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant . not surprisingly , she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as `` spitting in your own face . '' so , just how much did rand believe in her own philosophy ? let 's just say a lot . with signature modesty , she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of aristotle and thomas aquinas . orson welles . when you create a cinematic masterpiece such as `` citizen kane '' at the ripe old age of 25 , you 're bound to get a big head . but welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that . in fact , `` citizen kane '' might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego . after all , it 's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul william randolph hearst because hearst slighted welles at a dinner party . of course , after the unparalleled success of `` citizen kane , '' welles 's arrogant side did n't get any less subtle . do yourself a favor : track down a recording of welles ' outtakes for a tv commercial for frozen peas . you 'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker 's oversized ego . a classic quote goes : `` in the depths of your ignorance , what is it you want ? '' frank lloyd wright . as the brains behind the robie house , fallingwater , taliesin west , the guggenheim , and countless other design benchmarks , frank lloyd wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture . and , boy , did he know it ! wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals . in fact , the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him . but when you 're wright , you 're right . in 1935 , department store magnate stanley marcus -lrb- of neiman-marcus fame -rrb- commissioned the architect to design his dallas home , but the project quickly went sour . wright 's avant-garde floor plan included `` sleeping porches '' that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round . in addition , marcus ' small bedroom `` cubicles '' came equipped with almost no closet space . when stanley respectfully explained that -lrb- a -rrb- temperatures during summer nights in dallas often exceed 80 degrees and -lrb- b -rrb- a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets , wright threw a series of tantrums . fortunately for the voyeur in us all , said tantrums usually took place in letter form . preserved and occasionally displayed at the dallas museum of art , they make for delicious reading . salvador dalí . `` every morning when i awake , the greatest of joys is mine : that of being salvador dalí . '' yup , he actually said that . everything about the legendary surrealist painter -lrb- he of the melting clocks -rrb- -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock , destroy convention , cause scandal , and stir controversy . criticized for choosing to live under general franco 's fascist government in spain , dalí defended his position by stating that he did n't care about others so long as he could be king . not exactly a man of the people . if he was n't getting enough attention , he was known to walk the streets of new york city clanging a hand bell . of course , this is also the guy who once said , `` the thought of not being recognized -lsb- is -rsb- unbearable . '' need another telling quote ? `` at the age of 6 years , i wanted to be a chef . at the age of 7 , i wanted to be napoleon . my ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since . '' apparently , so did his ego . al jolson . plenty of performers this side of gallagher have been labeled `` the world 's greatest entertainer . '' but al jolson really , really believed it . the vaudeville singer , actor , dancer , and comedian was born asa yoelson in seredzius , lithuania , in what was then part of imperial russia . as a performer , he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows , ad-libbing , or just stopping to talk to the audience . during a 1911 performance of the critically hated `` paris is a paradise for coons '' -lrb- title not edited for political correctness -rrb- , jolson stopped and asked the audience if they 'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play . the crowd roared with applause , and jolson ditched the whole program and took over . from that moment on , no one else could share the stage with him . unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list , however , jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance . according to most contemporary accounts , he actually was the greatest in the world . but , despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen , jolson 's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface -lrb- considered highly offensive now , but pretty common at the time -rrb- . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

'' the result is a boost for rising british star andy murray , who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the masters cup by winning his first match in paris and was expected to face djokovic . the 20-year-old , who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury , beat jarkko nieminen of finland 7-6 -lrb- 7-5 -rrb- 6-3 to progress into the third round . the 15th seed is seeking to overtake tommy haas , who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in shanghai . murray , who trails the german by just three points , has not beaten djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent santoro . ninth seed haas , who has struggled with illness and injury this year , will play djokovic 's compatriot janko tipsarevic in the second round . murray , who won his second title this year at the st petersburg open last sunday , made a confident start against nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on monday . he held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the swiss indoors event by roger federer last weekend , but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak . the scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal , but he leveled immediately and then broke nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory . defending champin and fourth seed nikolay davydenko , one of six players to have already qualified for shanghai , beat argentina 's juan del potro 7-6 -lrb- 7-3 -rrb- 6-1 in his opening match on wednesday . the russian , fined for `` lack of effort '' after his defeat by croatian qualifier marian cilic in st petersburg , will next face marcos baghdatis of cyprus in round three after baghdatis shocked 13th seed ivan ljubicic . ivo karlovic broke roger federer 's serve for the first time in his life , but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on wednesday . croatian karlovic , the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres , went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as federer played for the first time at the bercy event since 2003 . federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set . but the swiss top seed got straight back in harness , breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the basel semifinals . world numbet two rafael nadal also reached the third round after thrashing italy 's filippo volandri 6-3 6-1 . the spaniard will next play stanislas wawrinka of switzerland , who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed juan ignacio chela of argentina . e-mail to a friend .

'' the fbi is also seeking stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter , de meo said . police , who had called stiles a person of interest , began calling him a suspect late friday . there appeared to be physical similarities between stiles and the man in the videotape , de meo said . `` nothing that i have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through . whoever this person is is a predator that , as far as i 'm concerned , belongs in custody and , if successfully prosecuted , in jail for as long as the law allows , '' de meo said earlier . detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes , indicating she may have been brutalized before . nevadan darren tuck recently gave police the videotape , saying he found it in the desert , de meo said . police said the tape was in his possession at least since may before he handed it over to authorities . he is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support , but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him . tuck , who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police , faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography , de meo said . harry kuehn , tuck 's attorney , said this week on cnn 's `` nancy grace '' that tuck was `` racked by indecision '' about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was . asked why , kuehn said , `` he 's explained that to us , and at this point , we 're not going to share that , because it goes to the defense of the matter .

75	san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- you must know what 's really driving the immigration debate . it 's the culture , stupid . ruben navarrette jr. : some opponents of immigration , even the legal kind , fear changes in local culture . immigration restrictionists -- and by that , i mean those who want to limit all immigration , even the legal kind -- like to pretend they 're so high-minded . yet they ca n't help themselves . they always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants . the restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns : that our borders are n't secure , that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally , and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here . really ? if that 's the extent of it , then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on american culture through everything from taco trucks to spanish-language billboards . that seems to be the issue in north dakota , where , according to a recent article in usa today , towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them . in cooperstown , the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy , because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who ? american kids who work at starbucks ? nope . the article quotes orville tranby , a local community leader in cooperstown , who says that some residents have told him `` face to face '' that such facilities might attract hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture . you 'll find the same fear in lewisburg , tennessee . not long ago , an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in spanish . townspeople wanted no part of that . they demanded that all books purchased by the library , or even donated , be in english-only . these stories are ridiculous , but they 're also helpful . they illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration , and it goes well beyond words like `` legal '' or `` illegal . '' it 's the perception that the country is becoming more hispanic , that spanish is replacing english , that hispanic immigrants are weakening american identity , and that main street is turning into little mexico . a leader of the vigilante minuteman movement moronically called it the `` colonization '' of the united states . this sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy , that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners , and that our children are going to live in a world where they 're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up . it conjures up the alarm bells that benjamin franklin set off about german immigrants in the late 18th century , who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the english , but would `` swarm into our settlements , and by herding together establish their language and manners to the exclusion of ours . '' it popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that chinese immigrants were `` unassimilable , '' which led to congress approving the explicitly-named chinese exclusion act of 1882 . and it helped welcome the 20th century when massachusetts sen. henry cabot lodge warned that immigrants -lrb- read : the irish -rrb- were diluting `` the quality of -lrb- u.s. -rrb- citizenship '' and others complained that italian immigrants were uneducated , low skilled , apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity . where have we heard that before ? and when will we hear it again ? after all , hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists . but they wo n't be the last . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . you can read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .

81	shanghai , china -- championship leader lewis hamilton spun out of the chinese grand prix to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in brazil on october 21 . a disconsolate lewis hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in shanghai . rookie hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race , but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by mclaren team-mate fernando alonso in shanghai . the spaniard finished second behind ferrari 's kimi raikkonen , who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of hamilton . the young briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions . however , the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires , which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let finland 's raikkonen take the lead . and when hamilton -- who won in japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane , he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go . raikkonen and alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps , with the finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both hamilton and alonso . raikkone 's team-mate felipe massa was third , while fourth place was claimed by toro rosso 's sebastien vettel , who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in japan behind the safety car while hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing . britain 's jenson button was fifth in a honda ahead of vettel 's team-mate vitantonio liuzzi , while germany 's nick heidfeld was seventh for bmw sauber and david coulthard of scotland took the final point for red bull . hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season . `` i 'm sorry for the team but i can still do it , do n't worry , '' he said . `` when i got out of the car i was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year , and to do it on the way into the pits was not something i usually do . `` you can not go through life without making mistakes . but i am over it and we look forward to brazil . the team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there , and we still have points in the bag . `` we were having a great race and we did n't know if it was going to rain or not . the tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath . when i came into the pits it was like ice , i could n't do anything about it . '' mclaren boss ron dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off . `` it 's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this . it has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another grand prix , '' dennis said . `` i do n't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did lewis . but the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance . that 's what made the difference . `` it was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier , but would it have made a difference ? all the top teams -- ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire . '' alonso , who qualified for the race in fourth , is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles . `` the result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure , '' he said . `` i think the championship will still be very difficult because i know it will not be easy to take four points from lewis . `` i need something dramatic if i want to win . with a normal race it will be impossible . '' raikkonen added : `` we are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race . `` hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend . it is not just up to us though , we saw today that anything can happen , but we are back in the championship .

84	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- polygamist sect leader warren jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial , according to court documents unsealed by a utah judge on tuesday . sect leader warren jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him september 25 in st. george , utah . jeffs , the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints , is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape . the documents , released by fifth district judge james shumate at the request of the media , also indicate that jeffs confessed to `` immorality '' with a `` sister '' and a daughter more than 30 years ago . among the documents is a competency report on jeffs completed in april , in which social worker eric nielsen wrote that throughout the month of january , jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours . on january 28 , the report said , he attempted to hang himself in his cell . in the days following the suicide attempt , while he was on suicide watch , jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall . jail transcripts show that jeffs ' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother , nephi , in which he said , `` i am not the prophet . i never was the prophet , and i have been deceived by the powers of evil ... i ask for everyone 's forgiveness . '' jeffs also told his brother : `` farewell forever . '' the day before that , jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was `` covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when i was younger . '' in the flds , members call adult women `` sister , '' and jeffs ' meaning was unclear . jeffs ' defense attorneys , who argued against the release of the documents , said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that jeffs recanted them the following month . defense attorneys claim jeffs ' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made . they presented shumate with a letter from another jeffs attorney , arguing that the statements ' release could influence an arizona jury when jeffs stands trial in that state . jeffs , 51 , was convicted in september of being an accomplice to rape . he was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin . he faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced november 20 . the flds -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of hildale , utah , and colorado city , arizona . jeffs , a former school headmaster , is the son of the sect 's previous president and `` prophet , '' rulon jeffs , who died in 2002 . jeffs was on the fbi 's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in august 2006 outside las vegas , nevada . critics say that inside the flds , marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13 , and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men . if male followers are excommunicated , critics claim , wives and children can be reassigned . during jeffs ' trial , defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting jeffs because of his religious beliefs , including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven . if jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the flds , it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect . however , two of his followers who spoke to cnn -- although flds members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements . `` he is a perfectly priestly man , '' said a woman who identified herself as cathy . `` he is a man of god , and we will always love him . once a prophet , always a prophet . '' her husband , patrick , told cnn , `` it 's hogwash . i do n't believe it ... i will always consider him my prophet . '' e-mail to a friend . cnn 's gary tuchman contributed to this report .

86	algiers , algeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the united nations headquarters in algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building 's facade and leveled nearby u.n. offices . rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building . it was one of two suspected car bombs that struck algiers within 10 minutes of each other . the death toll is unclear : the official government count is at least 26 , but hospital sources in algiers told cnn affiliate bfm-tv that 76 people were killed in the two blasts . a statement from the united nations said 45 people were reported killed . algerian interior minister noureddine yazid zerhouni blamed a militant islamic group with ties to al qaeda for the attacks , which also targeted a building housing algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court . in a posting on an islamist web site , the group al qaeda islamic maghreb claimed responsibility . cnn could not immediately corroborate that claim , but the web site is known to carry messages , claims and videos from al qaeda and other militant groups . in the posting , the bombers were identified as sheikh ibrahim abu othman and abdel rahman abu abdel nasser al-asimi . it said two trucks were filled with `` no less than 800 kg -lrb- 1,763 pounds -rrb- of explosives . '' the group called the operation `` another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood , defending the wounded islamic nation and in defiance to the crusaders and their agents , the slaves of america and the sons of france . '' at least 10 u.n. staffers were among those killed , according to u.n. spokeswoman marie okabe . the offices of the un high commissioner for refugees -- located across the street from the u.n. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. -lrb- 3:30 a.m. et -rrb- tuesday . `` our offices are basically destroyed now , nothing works , '' unhcr spokesman ron redmond said from its geneva headquarters . watch his full interview . he said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped u.n. workers . `` it 's a very serious situation still with the u.n. in algiers , '' he said . in a strongly worded statement , u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon condemned what he called `` an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity 's highest ideals under the u.n. banner . '' `` the perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by algerian authorities and the international community , '' ban said in the written statement . he said he has sent senior advisers and other top u.n. officials to head to algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort . most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the constitutional council -- which oversees elections -- and supreme court in the algiers neighborhood of ben aknoun , according to the state-run algeria press agency . that blast struck a bus outside the targeted building , killing many of those on board , the news agency reported . one man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him . `` i saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me . i had to run away from the car , '' he said . zerhouni said the attack was the work of the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , the same group that took responsibility for an attack in april in downtown algiers that killed 33 people . that group also uses the name al qaeda islamic maghreb after merging with al qaeda earlier this year . it abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al qaeda . cnn international security correspondent paula newton said the merger combined the expertise of algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al qaeda in north africa , enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of algiers . she said the group 's goal is to destabilize countries like algeria , morocco and tunisia , which it sees as enemies of the islamic state . zerhouni said police interrogations of gspc members arrested in the wake of the april attack revealed that algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court were on a list of gspc targets . algeria , which has a population of 33 million , is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an islamist party was poised to win . tens of thousands of people died in the unrest . although the country has remained relatively peaceful , recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence . e-mail to a friend .

88	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there are some circuits that are cornerstones of the formula 1 calendar : the monacos and silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers . then there are the newer circuits -- malaysia and bahrain , for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins . fuji speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view . next week they have something completely new to contend with : a track that has yet to see a single f1 team put in a single lap . the japan grand prix is to return to the fuji speedway , a circuit that has n't seen an f1 race since 1977 -lrb- though now with a substantially different track layout -rrb- . the fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games . the old fuji speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game pole position -lrb- released by namco in japan and atari in the rest of the world -rrb- . the most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of mount fuji , japan 's tallest mountain , looming in the distance . though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies . the suzuka track -- which had held japanese grands prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike , but for this year and the next the japanese grand prix will be held at fuji . however an announcement by formula one management -lrb- fom -rrb- this month revealed that suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the japanese grand prix alternating yearly between fuji and suzuka after that . behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with f1 connections -- honda owns suzuka , toyota owns fuji . toyota is a relative newcomer to f1 but , having this year surpassed general motors as the world 's number one automobile manufacturer , and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock -lrb- a position that has n't been reflected in sporting success -rrb- , it is not without clout . the redesign of the fuji track was carried out by hermann tilke in 2003 . tilke , a german architect redesigned a number of f1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including malaysia , istanbul , bahrain and shanghai , and the tracks for 2008 's debut grands prix in singapore and valencia . so how do f1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as fuji without data from previous races to fall back on ? the answer lies with computer simulation . computer-aided design -lrb- cad -rrb- is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars . every bend , every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself . despite never having raced on the circuit , the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual fuji speedway for some time . bmw sauber 's simulation experts received cad data from the japanese race organizers late last year . and when their cars arrive at fuji for testing next week , their race set-up should be close to optimum . the circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments . the radius of each individual segment was measured , allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line -lrb- the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance -rrb- . then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated . the slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car . `` in order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend , we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels , gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance , '' says willy rampf , technical director of the bmw sauber f1 team . dieter glass , chief race and test engineer with toyota f1 explains : . `` you start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit . once you know that , you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce , before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions . `` getting a bit closer to the weekend , you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy . this prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track , like the degradation of the two bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time . if you have more fuel in the car , this affects your lap time , but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried . '' one peculiarity of the fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight , which at 1.475 km -lrb- 0.916 miles -rrb- will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but , after the straight the track is relatively twisty . the teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight , and the best grip decelerating into the bends . `` you have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip , '' says glass , `` and as always you want good grip in general , but you have to balance that with the long straight , where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed . '' the testing may be virtual , but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair 's breadth away from real world eventualities : . `` our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values , '' says rampf . not that everything can be predicted : `` i think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race , '' continues glass . `` many incidents can happen , which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy .

89	new albany , indiana -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush vetoed a $ 600 billion spending bill tuesday , accusing democratic leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases , then took his budget fight with congress on the road . congress should cut spending `` and send me a responsible measure that i can sign into law , '' president bush said . `` the majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility , but so far , it 's acting like a teenager with a new credit card , '' he said in a speech in new albany , indiana . the bill -- which bush said was laden with $ 10 billion in `` pork '' -- would have funded the departments of labor , education , and health and human services . it also would have funded projects such as a prison museum , a sailing school and a program to teach portuguese . `` congress needs to cut out that pork , reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that i can sign into law , '' the president said . watch a report on the veto '' while polls show bush 's popularity remains at near-record lows , congress ranks even lower as a whole . the president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year , which began october 1 . the bill bush vetoed tuesday includes about $ 150 billion to run those departments and more than $ 450 billion in mandatory spending on medicare and medicaid , the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor , according to the house appropriations committee . the committee 's chairman , rep. david obey , called bush 's veto `` not responsible and not credible . '' `` this is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 republicans , '' obey , d-wisconsin , said in a statement issued after the veto . `` there has been virtually no criticism of its contents . it is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics . '' bush said democrats are supporting $ 22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $ 205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases . `` when the bill for all that spending comes due , congress is going to turn to the working people , to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs , '' he said . tuesday 's veto is the fifth cast since democrats took control of congress in 2006 . congress has overridden one of those , voting last week to authorize $ 23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president 's objections . democrats will schedule another override vote this week , an aide to house majority leader steny hoyer said . but antonia ferrier , spokeswoman for house republican whip roy blunt , said bush 's gop allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto . bush signed a $ 470 billion pentagon spending bill that covers the defense department 's normal operations , but democrats split $ 50 billion in spending for the wars in iraq and afghanistan off into a `` bridge fund '' to which they plan to attach demands for bush to withdraw u.s. combat troops . the measure sets up another confrontation with the white house . bush also demanded congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes , but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue . he said a plan proposed by rep. charles rangel , the democratic chairman of the house ways and means committee , to eliminate the tax was unacceptable . `` preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas , '' he said . `` congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the amt relief to my desk as soon as possible . '' the elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $ 800 billion to be lost over 10 years . to replace that , rangel 's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $ 100,000 , after deductions , and close corporate tax loopholes . the bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers . republicans have already started calling it `` the mother of all tax increases . '' `` with all the other pressures on our economy , raising taxes is one of the most unwise things congress could possibly do , '' bush said . bush acknowledged the difficulties americans face from high fuel prices , a `` challenged '' housing market and `` uncertainty '' in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- `` but as we have seen in recent years , this economy is resilient , and that 's important for the american people to understand .

90	nyon , switzerland -- celtic have been fined $ 50,800 by uefa and ac milan 's dida has been banned for two matches after the incident which saw a pitch-invading supporter approach the brazilian goalkeeper in last week 's champions league match at celtic park . dida 's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in uefa suspending him for two matches . the incident occurred when the scottish side beat milan 2-1 in glasgow . a fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute , soon after the home side scored their winning goal , and made what appeared to be minimal contact with dida . the milan goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground . he was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced . dida 's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment , with half of their fine suspended for two years . uefa did have the power to change the result of the match , although that was always unlikely . uefa 's control and disciplinary body found celtic guilty of charges of `` lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters '' , while dida was found to have breached uefa 's `` principles of loyalty , integrity and sportsmanship '' . milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment , which as it stands means he will miss the club 's champions league games against shakhtar donetsk . `` it 's a suspension that is absolutely excessive , '' said milan lawyer leandro cantamessa . `` it seems to us a very , very unbalanced sentence . it turns dida into the protagonist of the incident , whereas the protagonist was someone else , and that 's not right from a logical point of view . '' celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27-year-old supporter , who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month . the club banned the fan for life from all their matches , home and away . celtic chief executive peter lawwell said : `` as a club we feel this penalty is proportionate to the incident in question and a fair outcome .

92	st. petersburg , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the acrimony from the republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the cnn/youtube gop presidential debate wednesday . the debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month . with five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season , the republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all , trying to differentiate their views on immigration , the iraq war , abortion , gun control and even whether they believed every word in the bible was true . unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on democratic front-runner hillary clinton , wednesday night 's attacks were launched at each other . former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov. mitt romney traded jabs over illegal immigration , something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month . romney attacked giuliani 's record , saying that as mayor , he promoted illegal immigration . and giuliani shot back , accusing romney of having a `` sanctuary mansion '' at his own home . watch the debate format produce raw moments '' `` in his case , there were six sanctuary cities . he did nothing about them . there was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home , illegal immigrants were being employed , '' giuliani said . romney denied giuliani 's allegation , and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other . in his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party , romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , who has been rising in the polls . rep. tom tancredo , who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration , seemed delighted with the give and take , saying the other candidates were trying to `` out-tancredo '' him . huckabee drew one of the night 's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the internal revenue service . `` most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging , and there 's a reason why , '' he said . sen. john mccain , freshly back from a visit to iraq over thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates , and rep. ron paul , the most anti-war of the candidates , tangled on two occasions over the iraq war . did youtubers get their questions answered ?

93	denver , colorado -- a colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter 's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $ 10,000 on a security system , hired a bodyguard for his son 's wedding and never leaves home without a .45 - caliber handgun strapped to his chest . keith reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case . the man , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case , says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of keith reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family . a report in the denver post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of colorado . paul logli , chairman of national district attorneys association , told congress this year that witness intimidation has become `` almost epidemic , '' according to the denver post . when asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of colorado 's witness protection program , the witness in the reynolds case said , `` all they told us was maybe we should move . '' `` i 'm pretty sure i told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program . i ca n't remember if i gave them all the details . '' the prosecutor assigned to the case , who did n't want to be named , told cnn . after reynolds ' conviction , the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home . they received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked . the couple received a death threat from reynolds himself through the mail . watch witness describe fear of being targeted '' reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation . however , it is likely he 'll be released within five years . no national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist , and minimal research has been conducted on the subject . the latest national institute of justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem . colorado has $ 50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget . in contrast , the city of denver spent almost $ 100,000 on landscaping last year . the state , on average , spends about $ 1,000 per witness . that figure supposedly includes moving expenses , rent , and furniture . the federal program spends in excess of $ 40 million per year on witness protection . one possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities , as do federal witnesses . `` it 's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public 's expense ; it 's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses , '' according to peter weir , executive director of the colorado department of public safety . colorado 's witness protection program is a `` joke , '' according to the rev. leon kelly , founder and executive director of the open door youth gang alternatives . kelly says the state does n't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward . more than a decade ago , a young man named darryl givens asked kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison . givens chose to testify . a few months later , he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends . that day continues to haunt kelly . rhonda fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son 's murder . javad fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married . he had plans to move east when a fourth of july barbecue in 2004 in changed all that . he witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing . javad fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in aurora , colorado . the couple , both 22 , died instantly . rhonda fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program . she confronted prosecutors after his murder . fields told cnn , `` i asked them what happened . why were n't any measures taken to safeguard his life ? and i was told he never asked for any protection . '' javad 's mother does not think it was her son 's responsibility to ask for protection . `` i think it 's the authorities ' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness , '' she said . field 's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program . prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting javad fields ' personal information be kept secret , but it was n't signed by a judge until one year later , after defense lawyers had already given the suspects fields ' personal information , along with crucial trial documents . `` i felt like the da 's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life , '' rhonda fields told cnn . district attorney carol chambers maintains the program has improved . she says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena , ensuring witnesses are aware of their options . that did n't start , however , until two years after javad fields was killed . e-mail to a friend .

95	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the white house is blasting congressional democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans ' care programs to the president 's desk by veterans day . the white house 's dana perino accused democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage . `` there 's absolutely no reason that the veterans ' bill could not have been signed by the president today , except for the political games that the democrats decided to play with it , '' white house press secretary dana perino said sunday in crawford , texas . congressional democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $ 150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities , including health , labor and education . democrats also added $ 3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs . the labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $ 10 billion over last year 's funding for those programs . the president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending . the house passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached , but the senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president . perino accused the democrats of `` trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes . '' `` the president wants clean legislation , a clean bill to fund the veterans , '' perino said . on saturday , the democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to president bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending , sayings disagreements over funding levels `` have never been so great that we can not reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the american people . '' `` key to this dialogue , however , is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground , '' house speaker nancy pelosi , d-california , and senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said in the letter . the leadership said last year 's congress , which was still under republican control , had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs . congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through december 14 , the leadership said . the current funding level `` is still below the $ 3.9 billion extra that we passed , '' said nadeam elshami , spokesman pelosi . `` we are committed to getting the extra funding that the congress already voted on the president 's desk for his signature . '' the leadership blamed republican members of congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill . perino , though , said the democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of congress . `` the democrats decided not to send the president this bill , '' perino said . `` that has to be laid at their feet .

96	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination sunday to blistering criticism of the iraq war from former coalition commander retired lt. gen. ricardo sanchez . lawmakers lashed back at retired gen. ricardo sanchez on sunday after he criticized the war effort . on friday , sanchez , who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004 , called the iraq war `` a nightmare with no end in sight . '' he said the bush administration , the state department and congress all share blame . speaking with military reporters in virginia , sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial , but the politicians have not been held accountable . `` i 'm astounded , really , '' south carolina republican sen. lindsey graham on cnn 's `` late edition '' with wolf blitzer on sunday . graham , who recently returned from baghdad , said he and gop presidential candidate sen. john mccain had visited sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004 . `` every time we talked to gen. sanchez , we got pushback -- we have enough troops ; guard and reserves are n't being strained , '' graham said . he added that sanchez 's own record in iraq is blemished : abu ghraib `` got out of control under his watch . the war in general got out of control under his watch . '' but graham said that `` finally , '' with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional u.s. troops since january , `` we are getting it right . '' sanchez told reporters that american political leaders have cost american lives on the battlefield with their `` lust for power . '' sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty , but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired . `` while the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power , our soldiers die , '' he said . that brought a tart response from mccain , the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee . `` i wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time , '' mccain told cbs 's `` face the nation . '' he said sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but `` unfortunately , that does n't happen very often . '' one of the reasons few speak out , he said , is evidenced by what happened to former army chief of staff gen. eric shinseki , mccain said . shinseki was sidelined after telling congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy iraq . sen. mitch mcconnell , a republican from kentucky , told abc 's `` this week '' that sanchez is simply wrong . `` my definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror , '' he said . `` i think we 're making significant progress toward that end . '' but , he added , `` i think the central government in iraq has been an embarrassment . they 've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for . '' graham said he hopes the government of prime minister nuri al-maliki will `` step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year . '' if that does not happen , he said , `` it will be incumbent upon us , as a nation , to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable iraq . '' that brought a blistering response from zbigniew brzezinski , national security adviser under president carter . `` what is this ? this is a colony , '' he said . `` that 's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter . '' even those iraqis who were happy to see saddam hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing u.s. presence , brzezinski said . though some countries are willing to go along with the united states , `` no one in the world really supports our policy in iraq , '' he said . in his friday speech , sanchez added that the `` surge '' of u.s. troops into iraq represents `` a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war . '' national security council spokeswoman kate starr did not address the comment . instead , she said , `` we appreciate his service to the country . as gen. petraeus and ambassador crocker said , there 's more work to be done but progress is being made in iraq . and that 's what we 're focused on now .

'' stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond ramadan . stone 's description seems a far cry from the abu ghraib prison operated by the u.s. military in the first years after the invasion . that prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse . `` there are no secrets that go on in detention , '' stone said . `` our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible . these agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world .

101	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the tennessee supreme court on wednesday refused to modify or overturn a lower court 's ruling allowing mary winkler , convicted of killing her minister husband , visitation rights with the couple 's three daughters . holding baby brianna , mary winkler stands next to matthew . in the foreground are mary alice and patricia . charles and diane winkler , parents of slain minister matthew winkler , had asked the court to intervene and either revoke mary winkler 's visitation rights or allow them to proceed only under supervision of a counselor . the children -- patricia , mary alice and brianna -- have been living with their grandparents since their mother was arrested last year . winkler has not seen the children in 15 months , said kay farese turner , her attorney . she said her client was `` absolutely elated about the news and believes this will be her best christmas ever . '' turner said she believes the visit may come before christmas . a jury convicted winkler earlier this year of voluntary manslaughter in the shotgun death of matthew winkler -- not the first-degree murder conviction prosecutors had wanted . she said the slaying came after years of abuse , including physical violence and being forced to dress `` slutty '' for undesirable sex acts . winkler received a three-year sentence , but a judge required her to serve only 210 days , gave her credit for the five months she had already served and allowed her to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility . she was released in august . at the time of their father 's death in march 2006 , patricia was 8 , mary alice was 6 and brianna was 1 . charles and diane winkler have moved to terminate mary winkler 's rights and have filed a $ 2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son 's slaying . the termination issue has not been decided in court . turner said the court may want to determine what , if any , bond winkler has with her children before making a decision . attempts by cnn to contact attorneys for the winklers were not immediately successful wednesday . in september , a lower court granted winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle . the court specified the visits be supervised by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the children 's interests and supervised by members of the couple winkler is living with or by her sister . a subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied , leading to their supreme court appeal . the winklers said if their former daughter-in-law got visitation with the children at all , it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor . at a september hearing , according to court documents , they said the children `` exhibit fear and confusion '' toward their mother `` and her role in their father 's death . '' one expert , in testimony , quoted patricia as saying her mother had killed her father and , `` i do n't know if she will kill me . i want to ask her if she would do that to me . it scares me , kind of ; if she did , well , i guess i would see my father . '' the winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother , the children experienced `` urination accidents , sleeping problems , graphic nightmares and sleepwalking . '' they said the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem until after the september hearing . turner , however , said she believes terminating winkler 's parental rights would not be in the children 's best interest . `` she has a faith rarely seen , and she loves those children , '' turner said . after matthew winkler 's death , winkler fled with the girls to the alabama coast , where she was arrested . she said during a september appearance on the `` oprah winfrey show '' that she never expected to get away with killing her husband , but that she fled to be with her daughters and `` have some good times .

'' churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside interstate 35 , but the prayers are still continuing . some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of i-35 being the `` holy '' highway , it needs some intensive prayer first . so we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic christians prayed on the the interstate 's shoulder in dallas . they chanted loudly and vibrantly , making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on . they prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would `` see the light '' and perhaps close down . they prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate . they prayed that all americans would accept jesus into their lives . watch believers offer prayers '' the woman who came up with the concept of `` light the highway '' is a texas minister named cindy jacobs . she says she ca n't be sure interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after `` once again reading isaiah , chapter 35 . '' jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history , such as the bridge collapse on i-35 in minneapolis last august and the assassination of jfk 44 years ago near i-35 in dallas . that 's why prayer certainly ca n't hurt , she adds . now , it 's only fair to say most people , the religious and the non-religious alike , do n't buy any of this , but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along i-35 . at an adult go-go club , the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others . and he says his club holds fundraisers , food drives and toy drives to help the community . but on the side of the road , the prayerful are n't going to change their minds . holy highways and nude clubs , they believe , are not a combination god has in mind . e-mail to a friend .
104	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a day after new jersey banned executions , newly released figures show that capital punishment dropped this year to a 13-year low . the supreme court will hold oral arguments january 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols . forty-two people have been put to death this year , according to the death penalty information center -lrb- dpic -rrb- , a washington-based group that opposes the practice . that figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999 , when 98 inmates were executed . next year 's figures are expected to drop further . the supreme court is to hold oral arguments january 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional . see how the rates have dropped '' the justices placed a moratorium on executions in late september , when they decided to review a kentucky case about whether the three-drug lethal `` cocktail '' of chemicals represents `` cruel and unusual punishment , '' since it may cause excruciating pain to inmates unable to express discomfort . stays of executions have been issued in several states until the larger constitutional issues are addressed . if the high court finds the procedures unconstitutional , it could take years before death-penalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection . and even if the method is declared acceptable , it would be months before new execution dates could be set . ten states carried out executions this year . outside the south , arizona , south dakota , indiana , and ohio together subjected six men to lethal injection . learn about states ' death penalty policies and statistics '' texas continues to lead the nation , with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year . overall , 86 percent this year were in the south . no more executions are scheduled this year . `` the death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years , '' said richard dieter , executive director of dpic . `` two thousand seven will be known as the year executions came to a temporary halt and as the year of concrete legislation reconsidering the death penalty . '' death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the south have been reluctant to impose the punishment , even in the face of rising big-city crime rates . `` i think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions , '' said kent scheidegger of the sacramento-based criminal justice legal foundation . `` i think people of the cities are not getting the quality of justice that people elsewhere receive . i think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted . '' new jersey 's legislature voted last week to outlaw the death penalty -- the first state to do so in 42 years -- and gov. jon corzine signed the measure into law monday . at the same time , he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the state 's death row . the move was largely symbolic , since no executions have occurred there since 1963 . similar bills in nebraska , new mexico and montana failed this year in the legislature . state lawmakers in maryland , colorado , north carolina , tennessee and california are also considering abolishing the death penalty , but no bills have been introduced . the supreme court on january 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from louisiana inmate patrick kennedy , sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter . the state 's high court upheld the punishment as appropriate . the justices in 1976 banned capital punishment for rape , but 19 years later , louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12 . state lawmakers distinguished the earlier high court case as pertaining only to `` adult women .

105	caracas , venezuela -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the price of sin rose monday in venezuela where president hugo chavez is on a campaign to make venezuelans cut back on drinking and smoking . `` everyone 's shocked , '' said leonora marino , owner of bodegon marino in valencia , venezuela , west of caracas . on monday evening , she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained , she told a reporter . alcohol is now 10 percent more expensive ; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier . `` really , it 's difficult to buy at these prices , '' she said , then joked , `` they say they 're going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking . '' the venezuelan government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social , economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking , said jose vielma mora , superintendent of seniat , the government body that oversees the collection of taxes . taxes on whiskey , brandy , cognac and other drinks that do n't come from cane sugar have been raised $ 1.79 -lrb- 3,838 bolivares -rrb- per liter , the government-run bolivarian news agency said . `` it 's unfair because , in the end , the consumer is the one who pays , '' said fernando fernandez , a liquor exporter . chavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people , not for revolutionaries . `` we can not be spending the international reserves of this country on whiskey , '' he said . the moves represent the first steps toward transforming each venezuelan into what chavez calls `` the new man . '' chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon ernesto `` che '' guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life . in april , chavez told a graduating class of medical students in caracas , venezuela , that the level of consumption of alcohol in the country represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed , according to an abn report . `` the vice causes much harm , not only to individuals , but to the collective health of the nation , '' said chavez , who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence . for his part , he has said he drinks too much coffee . also effective monday , stores near schools , churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol . taxes on cigarette imports have also increased , from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price . on the street , some people said they do n't understand the motivations for the increase , but predicted their consumption would not change . `` the venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking , '' said one person . chavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as hummers , which are imported privately and at great expense . there is no hummer dealership in the country . higher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich venezuela . last year , car sales increased by about 70 percent , according to the cia world factbook . but chavez , who was in cuba on monday visiting communist leader fidel castro , said he wants to focus less on material goals for venezuela 's 27 million people , 38 percent of whom live in poverty . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's flor santamaria contributed to this story .

108	durban , south africa -- india 's yuvraj singh smashed six sixes in one over as england crashed out of cricket 's world twenty20 tournament in south africa on wednesday . yuvraj singh smashes his sixth successive six off england fast bowler stuart broad . paul collingwood 's side were eliminated at the super eights stage after south africa earlier beat new zealand by six wickets in durban . england then lost by 18 runs to the singh-inspired indians , who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of thursday 's must-win clash with the hosts . singh reached the fastest 50 in twenty20 history , needing just 12 deliveries , as india made 218-4 . the left-hander 's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by stuart broad made him the first player to do so in twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket . south africa 's herschelle gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over world cup in the west indies earlier this year , while sir garfield sobers and ravi shastri achieved it in first-class matches . singh 's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from andrew flintoff to captain collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over , in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once . virender sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls , putting on 136 for the first wicket with gautam gambhir , who hit 58 off 41 deliveries . broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs , while fellow seamer chris tremlett took 2-45 . in reply , england battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs . opener vikram solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls , and kevin pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries , but no-one could match the fireworks provided by singh . left-arm seamer irfan pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs , while rudra pratap singh took 2-28 . if india can beat south africa , it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through . the proteas have two wins from two group e outings after beating new zealand , who have completed their super eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat . south africa restricted the black caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on wednesday , then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as justin kemp made an unbeaten 89 . kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical mark gillespie for the winning runs . he belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings , having come to the crease in the fourth over with south africa reeling at 17-2 . kemp added 28 in four overs with gibbs -lrb- 19 -rrb- before putting on another 65 in eight overs with mark boucher . boucher departed for 23 , caught by wicketkeeper brendon mccullum off gillespie , who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs . the experienced shaun pollock then joined kemp , and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the proteas to their second victory . the in-form craig mcmillan top-scored for the kiwis , hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in tuesday 's five-run win against england . mccullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with lou vincent , scoring 38 before becoming the first of morne morkel 's four victims . morkel , who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs , then removed ross taylor -lrb- 1 -rrb- two runs later and later bowled the dangerous jacob oram for a quickfire 15 . he had shane bond caught by boucher , and then almost became the first twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire billy doctrove . e-mail to a friend .
109	jacksonville , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- eduardo gonzalez , a petty officer second class with the u.s. navy , is about to be deployed overseas for a third time . making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back . mildred and eduardo gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported . his wife faces deportation to guatemala -- her home country that she has n't seen since 1989 . he also does n't know what would happen to his young son , eduardo jr. , if that happens . `` i like being in uniform and serving my country , but if she goes back i 'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job , '' he said . `` defending the country that 's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind . '' gonzalez , who works on helicopters that bring cargo , supplies and military personnel in and out of iraq , testified before a house judiciary committee panel last month , detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his , where military members ' families could be deported while they 're defending their country overseas . watch `` they 're tearing families apart '' '' `` i want to serve my country 100 percent . but with this issue in the back of my mind , i feel i ca n't do that , '' he testified on september 6 . the u.s. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases . each is handled case-by-case , not by the military , but by immigration authorities . the government does n't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to gonzalez 's . immigration officials also said marrying a u.s. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to u.s. citizenship or permanent legal status . lt. col. margaret stock , a member of the u.s. army reserves who teaches immigration law at the u.s. military academy at west point , new york , said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members . `` you got to understand . when you 're in a combat zone , you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy . you ca n't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you 're never going to see them again , '' she said . stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases . on the one hand , the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance , housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas . on the other hand , the same government is trying to deport the very same people . `` what 's happening right now is , because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws , we 've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home , '' she said . in gonzalez 's case , his wife , mildred , came to the united states with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old . they were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from guatemala . in september 2000 , mildred 's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application . her mother was granted legal status in july 2004 , according to gonzalez . however , six weeks earlier , gonzalez and mildred got married , canceling mildred 's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21 . as a result , her legal status still remains in jeopardy . a judge in june granted her a one-year extension to remain in the united states . if her legal status does not change by june 8 , 2008 , she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation . that 's just fine , according to mark krikorian , the executive director of the center for immigration studies , which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration . `` what you 're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces , and that 's just outrageous , '' he said . `` what we 're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military . ... there 's no justification for that kind of policy . '' gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified . `` i 'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too . '' gonzalez himself entered the country legally , crossing the mexican border with his family when he was about 10 . he joined the navy as a so-called `` green-card sailor '' and became a u.s. citizen in july 2005 . the military does accept some immigrants who are n't u.s. citizens . `` i understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained , but on the other token , there are times when the situation is just out of their reach , '' gonzalez said . his wife , mildred , added , `` we did n't come here to break the law . we just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else . '' u.s. army sgt. emmanuel woko , a member of the army 's 2nd brigade , 1st infantry division who faces his third tour in iraq , understands just how gonzalez and his family feel . his wife and children could be sent back to nigeria . `` my heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to nigeria while i am deployed in iraq , '' he said . `` i am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought . '' that 's a sentiment echoed by gonzalez : `` we are not asking for anything . we are just asking for our families to stay with us .

' '' dye said stiles was calm and cooperative . stiles , a resident of pahrump , nevada , was turned over to las vegas metropolitan police and booked into the jail in clark county , where he had been sought in connection with the videotape , which shows a girl being sexually assaulted . the girl , who is now 7 , was found last month after a nationwide search . the tape was given to authorities by darren tuck , who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over . because of the delay , during which tuck allegedly showed the tape to others , he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography . he turned himself in to authorities in nye county , nevada , earlier this month . professionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found , and she appears to be `` healthy and fine and happy , '' her mother 's attorney said this month . the mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month , donohue said . `` a family friend called her and said , ` my god , you need to turn on the tv . i believe that is your daughter , ' '' donohue said . donohue said the mother recognized stiles , a former animal trainer . the alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work , donohue said . another former girlfriend of stiles ' , tina allen , said this month she thinks she is the reason stiles came in contact with the girl and is `` mortified '' by the allegations against him . `` he said he 'd been in the navy and , you know , i was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what i thought they needed to be , '' allen said . allen said she took stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived . also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter , the alleged assault victim . todd allen , tina allen 's son , said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ed payne contributed to this report .
113	glasgow , scotland -- scottish premier league leaders celtic suffered another setback in their bid for a third successive title after being held 1-1 by managerless hibernian on saturday . david murphy 's goals have earned hibernian four points against the auld firm this season . gordon strachan 's team head the table by three points from glasgow rivals rangers , who have three games in hand ahead of sunday 's trip to aberdeen . visiting hibernian , whose manager john collins surprisingly resigned on thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the edinburgh side 's board , took the lead in the 20th minute through left-back david murphy . the englishman played a one-two with abdessalam benjelloun before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper mark brown and in off the crossbar . murphy 's only other goal this season came in hibs ' 1-0 win at rangers on october 6 . brown did well to keep out merouane zemmama 's audacious shot from just inside the celtic half soon after , and also tipped over brian kerr 's looping header three minutes after half-time . substitute jiri jarosik rescued celtic from a first home spl defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by jan vennegoor of hesselink , who then headed against the post with two minutes to play . hibernian held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men , after benjelloun was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used . the victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place , while celtic have taken just six points from the last five games . strachan , who confirmed he is hoping to sign brazilian defender coelho next month , said : `` we need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season , they are silly mistakes . `` we could have definitely done something with every one of them . i 'm happy with the number of chance we 've made in the last few weeks , but unhappy with individual mistakes . `` it 's not been great to look at , and we need to cut it out . we have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying , ` that was my fault .

114	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- democratic presidential candidates on wednesday criticized president bush 's plan to withdraw roughly 30,000 troops from iraq by next summer , with sen. hillary clinton labeling it `` too little , too late . '' sen. hillary clinton listens as gen. david petraeus testifies before the senate armed services committee . in an open letter to bush , clinton said the troop withdrawal `` is simply too little , too late , and unacceptable to this congress , and to the american people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home , and end this war . '' bush on thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of gen. david petraeus that the troop levels in iraq be lowered to 130,000 by july , down from the `` surge '' level of 160,000 . `` as commander in chief , you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of u.s. forces from iraq , and to bring so many more troops home so much faster , '' the new york democrat said . `` i strongly urge you to choose this course of action . '' in an interview wednesday with cnn , one of clinton 's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination , sen. barack obama of illinois , said the president is returning to an earlier , failed policy . `` we now are still in the same position as we essentially were in june 2006 , '' he said . `` we are in the same levels of violence ; we are at the same levels of dysfunctional when it comes to the government in iraq , and the american people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in washington and from the president : when is enough enough ? '' watch '08 dems weigh in on war in iraq '' obama presented a new plan for iraq on wednesday afternoon in clinton , iowa . it calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month , to be completed by the end of next year , according to excerpts released before his speech . a brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers . obama recommended a new constitutional convention for iraq , a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the country 's humanitarian crisis . `` let me be clear : there is no military solution in iraq , and there never was . the best way to protect our security and to pressure iraq 's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops , '' obama said in his speech . presidential candidate john edwards , who has been pressing congressional democrats to take a more confrontational stance against president bush , called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops . in a prepared statement , edwards , a democrat from north carolina , said obama , clinton and republican sen. john warner of virginia , who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by christmas , have `` a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them , including a filibuster , to force the president to change course . '' edwards also called obama 's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president 's plan . `` sen. obama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year , '' said edwards , `` which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president 's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer . '' in a statement , sen. christopher dodd , d-connecticut , said wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when `` the underlying policy is a complete failure . '' `` i call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any iraq measure without a firm , enforceable deadline tied to funding for the completion of redeployment of troops from iraq , '' dodd said . democrats lack the votes in congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position . congressional democratic leaders are meeting with republican lawmakers , who want a change in war policy but are unwilling to cut funding or set a timeline for withdrawal . privately , congressional democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in iraq . the democratic presidential candidates , particularly the five in congress , face pressure from liberal groups such as moveon.org demanding that they directly confront the president . obama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline . `` you know , we are going to have to evaluate what 's available , but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise , short of congress forcing him to accept a shorter timetable , and , absent that , we are essentially engaging in a bunch of symbolic action there , '' obama told cnn . `` what we need is a clear message from the congress that it is time for us to change course , and it 's time for us to do that , '' he said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's john king , dana bash , scott anderson and xuan thai contributed to this report .

116	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious house resolution labeling turkey 's treatment of armenians in world war i as genocide . a kc-135 tanker lands at incirlik air base in southern turkey in 2003 . turkey , a longtime u.s. ally and nato partner , was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of armenians by ottoman turks genocide and threatened to block access to incirlik air base after the resolution passed a house committee vote . the base , in southern turkey near syria , is a major resupply center for u.s. operations in iraq and elsewhere in the mideast and asia . the pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in iraq if turkey cuts off u.s. access to the strategically important incirlik , military officials said tuesday . ankara acknowledges the killings of armenians during world war i but vehemently objects to the `` genocide '' label . the house foreign affairs committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution . house speaker nancy pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full house sometime next month . but the bush administration urged congress to drop the issue , and some leading democrats urged pelosi not to bring it to the floor . majority leader steny hoyer signaled tuesday that the vote might be put off . `` i said i thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here , '' said hoyer of maryland . `` i have not changed on that , although i would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions . we will have to determine where everybody is . '' democratic rep. ike skelton , the chairman of the house armed services committee , announced his opposition to the resolution last week . and democratic reps. alcee hastings of florida and john tanner of tennessee , both members of the u.s. house delegation to nato , urged pelosi to reconsider in a letter released tuesday . `` more than half of the cargo flown into iraq and afghanistan comes through incirlik air base , and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future , '' they wrote . lt. gen. carter ham , the director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff , said pentagon planners are looking at `` a broad range of options '' to keep food , fuel and ammunition flowing to u.s. troops in iraq if turkey blocks incirlik . `` we 're confident that we 'll find ways to do that , '' ham told reporters at the pentagon . `` there 's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that , and obviously we 'd prefer to maintain the access that we have . '' defense secretary robert gates echoed lawmakers ' concerns last week . `` about 70 percent of all air cargo going into iraq goes through turkey . ... about a third of the fuel that they consume goes through turkey or comes from turkey , '' gates said . he also said that 95 percent of the mine-resistant ambush-protective vehicles , or mraps , being deployed in iraq are flown through turkey . the vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs . see incirlik 's key location '' the u.s. military issued a `` warning order '' a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews , planes , fuel and routes are lined up if turkey stops or restricts u.s. access to incirlik , a source said . jordan and kuwait are among the alternatives the united states is considering . some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the turks to attack kurdish rebels in northern iraq which could further complicate iraqi stability , u.s. officials said . incirlik offers 10,000 - and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters , according globalsecurity.org , a source of background information about military issues . globalsecurity said incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to iraq , taking over for rhein-main air base in germany because it is closer to iraq , reducing the strain on troops and aircraft . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's barbara starr and deirdre walsh contributed to this report .
117	united nations -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united nations is calling on nato to do more to stop the afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates afghanistan 's economy . afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in taliban-controlled helmand province in april 2007 . the report from the u.n. 's office on drugs and crime shows the export value of this year 's poppy harvest stood at around $ 4 billion , a 29 per cent increase over 2006 . despite afghan security forces ' efforts to curb the trade , 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007 , the report said . opium is derived from poppies , and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground . the report said opium has accounted for more than half of afghanistan 's gross domestic product in 2007 . investorwords.com defines gdp as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a calendar year . according to the u.n. survey , about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers . the rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop , to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade . antonio maria costa , executive director of the u.n. office on drugs and crime , urged nato to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade , which has increased dramatically since the american-led invasion to remove the hard-line islamist government of the taliban in october 2001 . `` since drugs are funding the insurgency , nato has a self-interest in supporting afghan forces in destroying drug labs , markets and convoys , '' costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey . `` destroy the drug trade and you cut off the taliban 's main funding source . '' james appathurai , a nato spokesman , said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade . `` we share the u.n. 's concerns , '' appathurai told cnn . `` drugs not only poison people , but they poison economies and governments , and it is in everyone 's interest to stop this proliferation . '' he said nato forces were providing assistance to afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly . `` the issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for nato , but at the moment this is a matter for the afghan government , '' appathurai said . farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country , appathurai said . however , he said , in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the taliban stronghold of helmand , poppy production was going on largely unchecked . according to the report , u.n. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes . costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals , like acetic anhydride , that must be smuggled into the region . he called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between afghanistan and its neighbors . `` drug trafficking is a transnational threat , and therefore national initiatives have their limitations , '' the u.n. drug chief said . appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on . he also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production . `` you can not have eradication in isolation . if we do n't give them the support to produce alternative crops , then by wiping out their opium fields , you are only creating enemies for the future , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .

123	-lrb- realsimple.com -rrb- -- why shoes are called `` pumps '' and other strange-but-true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love . so , how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start ? manolo who ? long before they ever made an appearance on the tv show `` sex and the city , '' pointed shoes were favored by polish nobles , who introduced the fashion to england on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s . the shoes , dubbed `` crackowes '' or `` poulaines '' -- after kraków , poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging . in 1363 the english attempted to rein in the look by law , assigning shoe spans to social classes . commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches , while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length . who invented the sports bra ? in 1977 university of vermont student lisa lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra was n't holding up . with the help of two classmates , lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto ! -- the sports bra was born . the coeds founded the company jogbra a year later , garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere . almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually . real simple : best bras for every figure . is there a real mary jane behind mary jane shoes ? not quite : the most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in `` buster brown , '' a children 's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s . mary jane was either buster brown 's sweetheart or sister , depending on which source you consult . what 's the connection between shakespeare and raincoats ? gabardine , a water-repellent fabric invented by burberry , got its first mention from shakespeare . the bard used the word in the merchant of venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms . during world war i , british officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original burberry trench . who was the first person known to have pierced ears ? no one knows who originated the style , but there 's evidence that as early as 2500 b.c. sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops . and guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy : men have been wearing earrings since ancient egypt , where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 b.c. real simple : best way to clean jewelry . what was the inspiration for lilly pulitzer 's colorful printed dresses ? bored palm beach socialite lilly pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time , but she found one drawback : the citrus concoctions discolored her clothes . she instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains , and the `` lilly '' design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born . the style was an instant hit with customers , who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice . how did pumps , stilettos , and sneakers get their names ? the term pump first popped up in 1550 in england , where male servants sported the style . it is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump . the word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s ; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore `` sneaky . '' the modern usage of stiletto , a renaissance-era italian word for an assassin 's narrow-bladed knife , made its debut in 1953 . the word turned out to be especially appropriate , because the shoes ' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors . when did folks start toting around umbrellas ? for thousands of years , in such places as egypt , china , japan , mesopotamia , and india , umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun . -lrb- when it rained , the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs . -rrb- . umbrellas were n't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries . and another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight , portable , and available to average joes . have bikinis always been so popular ? hardly ! named for the nuclear-testing site bikini atoll , the suits first appeared in 1946 , but american women thought them immodest . not until the 1960s were they accepted , possibly helped by the hit song `` itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini . '' were french cuffs really created for the battlefield ? it is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat . but , in fact , french royalty invented the style in the 1500s , when flowing sleeves were the rage ; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners . amusingly , the competitive english tried to take credit for the fashion , which to this day they refer to only as `` double cuffs . '' have women always carried purses ? once upon a time , ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing -lrb- sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack -rrb- and accessible through slits in their skirts . around 1800 , thinner , silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue , and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections . the solution ? they began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead . why is underwear nicknamed `` drawers '' ? in the 16th century , drawers became a common term for both men 's and women 's underpants . made of linen , the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable -lrb- this being well before victoria ever had a secret ; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century -rrb- . most likely , underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body . real simple : get your lingerie in order e-mail to a friend . get a free trial issue of real simple - click here ! copyright 2007 time inc. . all rights reserved .
124	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal emergency management agency officials know the agency 's performance in the california wildfires will be watched closely for comparisons to its failures in hurricane katrina . a volunteer distributes donated food and supplies to evacueestuesday at san diego 's qualcomm stadium . fema director david paulison promised on tuesday `` a different type of response than the federal government put together for katrina . '' paulison said katrina `` was a wake-up call '' and that `` this is a new fema . '' president bush signed a federal disaster declaration wednesday , freeing up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in southern california . `` i will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated , that we are responding to the needs of people , but most importantly i want the people in southern california to know that americans all across this land care deeply about them , '' he said . the action follows an emergency declaration by bush on tuesday morning for the counties of los angeles , orange , riverside , san bernardino , san diego , santa barbara , and ventura . he said he 's `` looking forward '' to his visit to the region on thursday . according to a statement from the white house , the federal disaster declaration will allow for federal aid that `` can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs , low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses , and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster . '' fema and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the gulf coast in 2005 . for example , the fires are n't covering every square foot of the region , as katrina did . the devastation in california is intense but not universal . during and immediately after katrina , the destruction was so complete that relief personnel and supplies -- even the u.s. army -- could not get within miles of the disaster 's epicenter , new orleans ' lower ninth ward , for several days . by contrast , roads in southern california have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay . residents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape , whereas many of katrina 's victims were poor and had no means of transportation . victims in california are not stranded on rooftops without food or drinkable water , but are able travel the relatively short distances to safe places . one of those safe places is san diego 's qualcomm stadium , which is not endangered by the fires . fema and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims ' needs in an organized way . new orleans ' superdome , on the other hand , sitting in the center of the disaster zone , was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water . what had been a shelter devolved into a trap . katrina also wiped out the gulf coast 's communications infrastructure , crippling the coordination of relief efforts -- even for the military . homeland security secretary michael chertoff acknowledged tuesday that the government 's response machinery had benefited from the katrina experience . `` i think there 's no question that -lsb- there were -rsb- a couple of the lessons from katrina which we have put into effect here , '' chertoff said . `` first of all , planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges , so that we have worked together and planned together with the defense department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis . that 's been a big help here , '' chertoff said . `` second , we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue , '' chertoff said . chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have fema ready , `` and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent , and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent , we sprang into action yesterday . `` so we 've been monitoring the situation continuously . the president 's been on top of it . we 've been on top of it . and we 're going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can . '' chertoff said tuesday that he had n't waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance . `` we have been moving cots , blankets , other supplies into the area of san diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity , '' he said . `` we 've also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire , once the winds begin to die down . '' people left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at www.fema.gov , paulison said . watch paulison discuss the `` new fema '' '' he denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of katrina that the federal response was hampered because national guard equipment was in short supply because of the iraq war . `` i just have n't seen that , '' he said . the u.s. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires , including 11 defense department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six c-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant . more than 17,000 national guardsmen have been made available ; 550 marines were ready for deployment from camp pendleton , north of san diego ; and 12 defense department firefighting teams , were engaged . e-mail to a friend .

126	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the late chris benoit idolized the dynamite kid , who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying , acrobatic moves . chris benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in june . the dynamite kid and his partner , davey boy smith , were known as the british bulldogs . they were quick , agile and muscular , and in 1986 they won the world wrestling federation tag team championship . young benoit dreamed of wrestling like the dynamite kid , whose real name is tom billington . at the beginning of his career , benoit adopted the dynamite nickname and copied his idol 's signature moves . in june , benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself . investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in chris benoit 's body , georgia 's chief medical examiner said a month later . when asked about benoit 's double murder-suicide , billington told cnn , `` it can make you aggressive , the steroids . but personally i would n't , you know , kill no bleeding kid , or wife either . '' billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside manchester , england . he has lost the use of his legs . a pin sticks out from one of his toes . billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body . and from the steroids , he said . billington told cnn that the steroids came from doctors , from friends , even from steroids meant for horses . he took them all , took a terrible pounding in the ring , and like his partner -lrb- who died at age 39 in 2002 -rrb- , began taking extensive amounts of painkillers . benoit 's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled , now known as world wrestling entertainment , and the man who has ruled wrestling for years , chairman of the board vince mcmahon . mcmahon , appearing with linda mcmahon , his wife and wwe ceo , told cnn : `` nothing from the wwe , under any set of circumstances had anything to do with chris benoit murdering his family . how did we know chris benoit would turn into a monster . '' read a full transcript of the mcmahons interview . vince mcmahon defended the organization , saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show . `` our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else 's in sport , although again emphasizing we are entertainment , and no one in entertainment , no one has this kind of wellness policy , '' mcmahon said . critics say mcmahon pushes his stars and non-stars , works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling . they say mcmahon only looks at his employees as commodities , pawns in a huge business . his businesses are quite successful . about 16 million people a week tune into wwe tv shows . two of their cable programs -- `` raw '' and `` friday night smackdown '' -- are weekly ratings giants . pay-per-view specials generate an average of $ 100 million per year . when asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old , vince mcmahon said each person in the wwe bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena . `` if someone passes through our organization , it is not our responsibility for someone 's personal activities , '' he said . he also said there is n't `` any organization in the world , be it entertainment or be it sport , that can tell you that they are totally drug-free . '' watch as a wwe wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong '' the mcmahons said the wwe is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes . since the newest wwe drug screening program began in february 2006 , more than 30 of the organization 's wrestlers have been suspended , including two since cnn 's interview with the mcmahons . david black -- who helped the nfl develop its drug program and now runs tests for the wwe -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning . but dr. gary wadler , a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes , says the wwe is not doing enough . `` it certainly falls far , far short of where it needs to be , '' he said . `` and there is a gold standard , and i measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard . and -lsb- the wwe is -rsb- miles apart . '' wadler , a longtime critic of mcmahon , was referring to the u.s. anti-doping agency in colorado springs , colorado . u.s. athletes training for the olympics are randomly tested and , if caught just once , face a two-year suspension from competition . if caught a second time , they can be banned for life . black 's programs test wrestlers four times a year . the first is a `` baseline '' test , according to the wwe . black then tests for `` nonmedical '' uses , meaning that if an athlete has a prescription , he is cleared . `` it 's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program , '' said travis tygart , who heads the u.s. anti-doping agency . mcmahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids . he says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years . watch one of the new wwe stars talk about being `` straight edge '' '' `` there 's an expression in our business , that here is where you make your money . it 's your face , it 's what you do with it , '' he said . `` it 's your personality , it 's what you do with it . it 's your delivery , your elocution . it 's storyline , it 's things , all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring .

127	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- everyone goes through a rebellious phase . and , if you 're lucky , you 'll be able to look back on those years and laugh . if you 're less lucky , you spent those years on a reality show , so for the rest of time , millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead . in modern times , cats frolic among the ruins of ancient rome . but , hey , it could be worse . you could be responsible for the fall of western civilization , just like justa grata honoria , the roman princess whose wild ways and -lrb- literally -rrb- naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the roman empire . barely regal . smart , conniving , and ruthless , honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a roman emperor , except for that pesky y chromosome . as a young girl , she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother , valentinian iii , was crowned emperor of the western roman empire , while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage . hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life , honoria rebelled with aplomb , sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens . although her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal , they failed to satiate her need for attention and power , so honoria set her eyes on the throne . employing her ample charms , she seduced her brother 's royal chamberlain , eugenius , and together , they plotted to murder valentinian and seize power . but , alas , their scheme was soon exposed . eugenius was executed , and honoria was sent to a convent in constantinople . life as a nun was a fate worse than death for honoria , but even that could n't quell her ambition . she spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another . finally , out of sheer desperation , she turned to sources outside the empire . her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy valentinian and risk open war with rome . only one man fit that description : attila , king of the huns . attila the hubby . honoria got the barbarian 's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal : if attila would rescue her , she would marry him , and he would get half of the western empire as her dowry . of course , honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the roman empire . but she was betting that after marrying her , attila would conquer the whole empire , and she 'd become queen to boot . attila had secretly been planning a move against rome for years , and honoria 's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike . wasting no time , he told valentinian that he planned to marry honoria , and demanded the dowry he 'd been promised . naturally , valentinian refused , and attila used his status as a `` wronged husband '' to invade roman territory in 451 c.e. . the hun armies quickly swept through the empire , destroying everything in their path , and eventually they arrived in rome . like all the other cities before it , rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the huns during the invasion . rome survived attila 's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe , the visigoths , but the western empire never recovered . within a generation , the armies of the goths , franks , and huns had overrun the area . the princess bride . ultimately , honoria became neither roman empress nor a hun queen . attila never rescued her , and she was eventually sent back to rome and left to her brother 's justice . not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed , and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again , valentinian settled on a suitable third option . after years of struggle , honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along : she was married off to an elderly roman senator , and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .
128	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- i was 14 at the time . lebanon 's civil war was in full flood . one afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in beirut . a lebanese woman and her son run through west beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces . we ran from school screaming . forget the book bags , classmates , homework . just run . out of breath , my knees giving way , it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block . the memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently . after more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction , the bombings and assassinations have returned to beirut . every time i hear of a new explosion , i think of a frightened child sitting in darkness . in 1988 , i watched the last throes of lebanon 's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of lebanese , sad , frustrated and often fearful . see a timeline of lebanon 's recent history '' now i watch from another continent , but i find those same emotions resurfacing . the conspiracies , the car bombs , the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar . the actors are like shadows from a long gone past . they are grayer perhaps -- those who have avoided assassination . but the cast in lebanon 's tragedy has changed little in two decades . then , as now , a presidential election is the setting , and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set lebanon back 20 years . see bios of lebanon 's major players '' in 1988 , the president 's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate . militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building . compromise was nowhere in sight . the west had abandoned lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors . syria had its choice for president ; israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing muslim radicalism . the country was awash with weapons . in his last act as president , amin gemayel named fellow christian and army chief michel aoun as prime minister . at a stroke , he shattered the convention that a muslim hold that position . muslims refused to serve in the cabinet and the country ended up with two governments . aoun famously declared : `` i am prime minister and six ministers in one . '' aoun 's `` war of liberation '' against syria turned into defeat . then , he turned on fellow christians of the lebanese forces in the `` war of elimination . '' when that failed , the syrians drove aoun to take refuge at the french embassy . in august 1990 , i came to cnn as a world report panelist . i tried to explain lebanon 's chaos , the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians . i had seen people killed in front of me ; children orphaned in seconds , parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins . so when i was offered the opportunity to stay at cnn , i gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy . but almost as i left , the civil war was being laid to rest . the various factions had fought each other to a standstill ; arab governments , supported by the west , helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by syrian influence . peace came to lebanon , but it would be five years before i returned . in 1995 , i went back and was stunned . i kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants . i could n't believe that i could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another . no longer did identity -- christian , muslim or druze -- define where lebanese could go . people mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble , laughing at the same jokes . it was as if lebanon 's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser . downtown beirut , once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes , was rocking to lebanese pop music . the dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest european fashions and deluxe hotels . lovers had returned to beirut 's corniche , overlooking the mediterranean , for romantic strolls at sunset . but the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a `` pax syriana . '' as anti-syrian sentiment grew , so did political tensions . on valentine 's day 2005 , the corniche was once again rocked by an explosion . former prime minister rafik hariri was killed . the symbolism left me speechless . on the day of love , lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history . it had been widely expected that hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of syrian troops . suspicion fell on damascus , which vehemently denied involvement . on march 14 , martyrs ' square became a human sea of demonstrators : muslims , druze and christians alike , demanding the `` truth . '' but hariri 's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken lebanon a generation previously . even after it withdrew its troops , syria still had allies in lebanon . one was hezbollah , accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of u.s. marines in beirut more than 20 years previously . another was gen. michel aoun ; now back from exile , the same michel aoun who had defied syria in 1989 , but who now made common cause with hezbollah against his fellow christians . earlier this year i visited martyrs ' square . the spirit of the cedar revolution had evaporated . the place looked like a morgue . anti-government hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill . as i passed through , business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair . i wondered if they sensed my disappointment , my pain at watching beirut bleed again . lebanon 's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago . once again , the term of the president is approaching its end ; there is no agreement on his successor . suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day . and the questions haunts me : will the country 's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries ? e-mail to a friend . cnn 's joe sterling , david ariosto , saad abedine and tracy doueiry contributed to this report .

'' watch a report on reactions to the verdict '' the foreign office said gibbons would be given credit for the four days since her arrest , meaning that the she has 11 days remaining on her sentence . earlier , miliband had met with siddig , who was summoned to the foreign office in london . `` i explained to him that we were very concerned by the case . we believe that this was an innocent misunderstanding , '' miliband said in a statement released thursday after the meeting . `` the sudanese ambassador undertook to ensure our concerns were relayed to khartoum at the highest level . he also said he would reflect back to khartoum the real respect for the islamic religion in this country , '' the statement added . on the first floor of the courthouse , around 25 police linked arms and forced journalists and british officials away from the court entrance . police detained some journalists , and confiscated a camera belonging to a freelance cnn cameraman . four vans filled with riot police were waiting outside the courthouse , but there were no signs of street disturbances or protests . staff from gibbons ' school , including robert boulos , the head of unity high school , were present . the staff members refused to comment on their colleague 's predicament . on wednesday , boulos said he was `` horrified '' when he found out that the complaint about the naming of the bear came from a member of his own staff -- not from a parent , as originally thought . defense counsel later confirmed that the complaint came from sarah khawad , a secretary at the school . gibbons has been working at the school -- popular with wealthy sudanese and expatriates -- since august , after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in liverpool , england , this summer , boulos said . he said gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot , which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats . e-mail to a friend . journalist andrew heavens contributed to this report . copyright 2007 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .
137	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- if you thought it was difficult managing your own money in 2007 , consider the pressure of the task when you 're dealing with $ 1.8 trillion of client assets . sallie krawcheck has made fortune 's list of the world 's most powerful women every year since 2002 . that 's what sallie krawcheck does as chairman and chief executive of citi global wealth management . she joined the banking industry as a research analyst , but quickly rose through the ranks , gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way . dubbed the `` mrs clean '' of wall street , ms krawcheck was credited with restoring investors ' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm smith barney . she joined citigroup in 2002 , and spent some time as chief financial officer before taking up her current role in march 2007 . sallie krawcheck has been a regular entrant on fortune 's list of the world 's most powerful women in business -- in 2007 , she made number 12 . john defterios caught up with ms krawcheck in dubai . he asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the g8 -lrb- canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states -rrb- . sallie krawcheck -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think what 's happening right now , it 's fascinating because in the united states and in developed europe we 're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis . and in fact , we are awash with liquidity in the middle east and in asia as well , so there 's really a bifurcation that 's occurring in the world . and if you think about , oil does n't even have to stay at the 90-plus dollar level it is ; even at levels in the 70 's , 60 's , 50 's , 40 's , a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market . yes , the investments are going up globally , but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region . and so over time , you 're really going to see ... i think continue to see ... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the middle east as well as to asia . john defterios -lrb- jd -rrb- : it 's coming almost as a perfect storm ; we have a sub prime crisis , a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years . in this window of time , is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of wall street and it undermines its role ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think there is no doubt that new york is losing its status as a financial capital of the world . if you think about some years ago , if you think about the internet bubble for example , where it was new york and california was n't it ? and you look at a whole range of reasons for it , and the sub prime crisis perhaps , the decline of the dollar perhaps . but you have overlapping regulators in the united states , you have very high taxes in the united states , you have a very litigious environment in the united states , and you have the emerging markets coming up , so capital is being raised outside of the united states . these things , some of which are negative for the united states , some of which are positive for the other regions , is accelerating a shift that was underway from new york , to london , to hong kong , to singapore , and potentially to dubai as well . -lrb- jd -rrb- : some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both wall street and capitol hill in washington . you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . you ca n't say i want some of that liquidity but i only want part of that liquidity . what is the result of that do you think ? can you over-regulate the sovereign funds ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : oh , i think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds . i think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well ; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of ` here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity ' . and the concern is if , gee these are going to be important going forward , we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets , but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the united states or europe for example . -lrb- jd -rrb- : it 's fascinating because if you look at qatar or egypt or shanghai , the stock markets have almost had like a one way path ; there 's been some correction here in the middle east . but what are we likely to see here , stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way , or an implosion because of the rapid gains ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think you 've got to separate the idea of what 's going on in the real economies and what 's going on in the market places . they move together , but sometimes they separate , they diverge , and they can diverge for a long period of time . if you look at economic growth potential of the middle east , of asia , of latin america , we feel very bullish about this . and i was making the point earlier today , china has been growing at 11 or 12 percent , not for one year or two years , but literally for 30 years . for 30 years it 's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see . so , say the same thing for the middle east , the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant , but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward . -lrb- jd -rrb- : is wall street , or for that matter , london or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case , 1.4 trillion dollars of assets ... -lrb- sk -rrb- : 1.8 thank you ... -lrb- jd -rrb- : ... to run one of the major money center banks of the world ? i 'm sure you 're feeling this pressure even though you 're young by international standards . are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : well it looks like the united states may be ready for a woman to take over as president . so i think if we 're ready to potentially have a woman run the country , i think we are getting ready as a country , to potentially have a woman run a money center bank . now , you know , the board would n't ask and i would n't accept , but if you look across wall street , there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are ceo 's who move along , and i think it 's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country . have your say . email us at mme@cnn.com, or send an i-report . e-mail to a friend .
138	editor 's note : ann curley is the assignment manager for the cnn medical news unit . she has been a type i diabetic for 40 years . this is her story of life with diabetes . ann curley uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin . -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- when i was 7 years old , my mom took me to the doctor because i had lost a lot of weight , despite a voracious appetite . my family had just moved from the san francisco bay area to pasadena , california , and this visit to the doctor 's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life . his name was dr. robert deputy , and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes . he spoke to me directly , rather than to my mother , and he asked me questions : did i feel thirsty ? did i need to urinate during the night ? the answer to both questions was yes . he asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate . dr. deputy told me and my mother that my body was n't processing sugar properly . i had diabetes . that is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began . i was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar , give myself injections of insulin , follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes . i spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease , and then they sent me home . dr. deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how i was doing . much to my parents ' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself . i refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine . this demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons , and not just for managing my diabetes . while some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden , i feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise . it forced our family to eat healthily , and it taught me about good nutrition -- something i practice every day . i know carbohydrate counts in most foods , and i understand dietary concepts that most people do n't even care about . being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar , so when my urine tested positive for glucose , my older sister robin was in charge of exercising me . we had countless jump-rope contests , bike rides and roller-skating excursions , keeping me and my three sisters active and fit . and i felt like a little mad scientist , using a test tube with drops of water , urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine . fortunately , over time , technology improved . first , test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it . but the truth is , testing urine for sugar was a primitive method . by the time sugar gets into the urine , it 's a signal that the body does n't have enough insulin to process sugar . and the urine test did n't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine . it simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine . inaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing . home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s , and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes . with the kit , the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood . the blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds . while i initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day , now i ca n't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing . the 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump . this device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin . the reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt . so rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body 's insulin patterns , the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant , then gives extra amounts with meals . another life-altering development in diabetes , which i have discovered in the last year , is the continuous glucose monitor , or cgm . this is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen , hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body 's fluids . the data is transmitted to a receiver , and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels . i have participated in clinical trials for three different cgm devices , and i found them all to be quite accurate . some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump , so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body . the patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated , but it 's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars . cgm technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type i diabetes using what 's called a `` closed loop system . '' this means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself . the current systems are `` open looped , '' meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given . the goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system , and all the patient has to do is wear it . once that technology is perfected , this type of device would be implanted , which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes . i mentioned to my sister robin that i had tracked down dr. deputy for this article . she told me something i did n't know when i was 7 . forty years ago , before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps , continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing , parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare . dr. deputy told my parents that i would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30 , which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out . i spoke with dr. deputy , who recently retired from his pediatric practice , and he seemed to remember me . when i asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival , he said sadly , `` at that time , that was what we told parents back then . ... everything changes with time -- diabetes , leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment . '' i think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong . i know that i certainly am . in fact , i am hoping to live another 40 years ! e-mail to a friend .

142	columbia , south carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- democratic sen. barack obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts friday in charleston , south carolina , that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign . democratic presidential hopeful barack obama is competing for the black vote with hillary clinton . the concerts were meant to boost black voters ' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar . the ensuing controversy highlighted that obama 's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of `` change '' is not without some serious pitfalls . when the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city `` embrace the change ! '' gospel tour last week , one name stood out to gay bloggers : donnie mcclurkin . the grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice , and that he was `` once involved with those desires and those thoughts '' but was able to get past them through prayer . to say the least , neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender community . john aravosis , a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the web site americablog , led the charge against the obama campaign , writing that the illinois democrat was `` sucking up to anti-gay bigots '' and `` giving them a stage . '' when the story bubbled up into the mainstream media , it took the obama campaign by surprise . obama 's efforts in the palmetto state have overwhelmingly targeted african-american churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in south carolina from rival sen. hillary clinton . the campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate 's faith , launching `` 40 days of faith and family '' in september , which used bible study groups to tap into the black electorate . campaigners have run three radio ads , one of which called obama a `` christian family man , '' that aired on gospel stations across the state . earlier this month , obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of greenville , where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with christian vocabulary , telling the crowd , to much applause , that `` i am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on earth . '' after that appearance , the obama campaign told cnn that republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values . `` i think that what you 're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s , '' obama said . `` at least in politics , the perception was that the democrats were fearful of talking about faith , and on the other hand you had the republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away . '' but on tuesday , obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows , especially among blacks . obama issued a statement saying , `` i strongly disagree with reverend -lsb- donnie -rsb- mcclurkin 's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the united states , '' and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious african americans . a september poll of african americans in south carolina by winthrop university and etv showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that `` sex between two adults of the same sex '' is `` strongly unacceptable . '' obama held a conference call wednesday with joe solomonese , president of the human rights campaign , and announced that the rev. andy sidden , an openly gay south carolina pastor , will appear at the same event as mcclurkin on sunday in columbia . solomonese was not completely assuaged . `` i spoke with senator barack obama today and expressed to him our community 's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with reverend mcclurkin , an anti-gay preacher who states the need to ` break the curse of homosexuality , ' '' he said in a statement . `` there is no gospel in donnie mcclurkin 's message for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people and their allies . that 's a message that certainly does n't belong on any presidential candidate 's stage . '' the state newspaper in columbia reported friday that obama organized a conference call thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders . after the call , the south carolina gay and lesbian pride movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside sunday 's concert in columbia . privately , obama aides say they believe obama is a candidate of real , transformational change , and that uproars like the mcclurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences . will obama 's refusal to kick mcclurkin off the concert bill hurt him ? like many political squabbles , despite the national story , it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states : iowa , new hampshire , nevada and south carolina . and in south carolina , where african americans make up about half of democratic primary-goers , voters might not have a problem with mcclurkin at all . e-mail to a friend .

144	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- state department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn iraq , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said friday . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice says that `` people need to serve where they are needed . '' rice was responding to foreign service officers ' objections to the possibility of `` directed assignments '' in iraq . the issue has caused an uproar in the state department , resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting wednesday . the new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers do n't step forward to fill open positions at the u.s. embassy in baghdad . if the state department enforces directed assignments , it will be the first time since the vietnam war era . one official called the order to serve in iraq `` a potential death sentence '' during the town meeting . the state department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates . those chosen will be given 10 days to respond , according to last week 's announcement . unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse , those who decline could face dismissal , it said . wednesday 's heated meeting was replayed on an internal state department television channel in washington several times and talked about widely . some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly , learning about it instead from news organizations last week . watch the diplomats exchange angry words '' `` i just have no respect for the whole process because you 've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues , '' said foreign service officer jack croddy . `` thank you for that comment . it 's full of inaccuracies , but that 's ok , '' harry thomas jr. , director general of the foreign service , shot back . others pointed out the risks of such assignments , considering the dangers of a war zone , lack of security and regular rocket attacks on u.s. personnel . rice , who did not attend the meeting , tried to calm things down friday by underscoring the state department 's attempts to do `` everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats . '' however , she said , `` this is one of the highest priority tasks of the united states , and we 're going to meet our obligations . '' speaking to reporters en route to turkey and the mideast , she said , `` i do n't know if we will have direct assignments or not , but we are one foreign service , and people need to serve where they are needed .

147	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it was two years late and billions of dollars over budget , but this week the singapore airline-owned a380 completed its maiden passenger journey between singapore and sydney . making history : the first double bed on a commercial jet . on board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience . this was a turning point in aviation history as airbus ' superjumbo became the world 's largest aircraft . and the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration . singapore airlines ' ceo , chew choon seng named the jetliner the `` queen of the skies '' . tom enders , ceo of airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds . and cnn 's richard quest , who was on board the maiden flight , said there was `` nothing quite like it '' . the luxury on board , he said , sets a new standard for air travel . it 's the quietest large passenger jet ever built -lrb- inside and out -rrb- , it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions , it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort . but the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the singapore airlines a380 is its '' beyond first class '' cabins . behind the sliding doors of the singapore airlines suites , the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading french yacht designer , jean-jacques coste . there 's a wide leather seat and alongside that , a standalone bed . this is two meters long with givenchy duvets and cushions . and for couples traveling , the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds . from bed or chair , travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen lcd . laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a usb ports and access a suite of office tools on singapore airlines ' in-flight entertainment system . celebrity chefs including britain 's gordon ramsay and georges blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off givenchy tableware . unlike other airlines , that have considered offering casinos , gyms and showers on their future a380s , singapore airlines has opted instead for a configuration that , whilst offering luxury , also makes money . as chew choon seng , ceo of singapore airlines reminded reporters last week , the first boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash . behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats , ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks , as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide . singapore airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $ 5.7 billion . the second is due to arrive next february with further deliveries later in 2008 . tickets for the a380 's first return commercial flight between singapore and sydney were sold at auction on ebay . one passenger paid $ 100,000 for the experience , with the majority paying between $ 1,500 and $ 5,000 . the $ 1.4 million raised has gone to charities in singapore , sydney and a global humanitarian organization . from sunday 28 october , singapore airlines will commence its scheduled service between singapore and sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction . the jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between singapore and london 's heathrow airport . it 's been a long road to this point for airbus , but the journey is by no means over . the airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers -lrb- see figures below -rrb- . next year it plans to deliver 13 , a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010 . tom enders , airbus ' ceo does n't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead . `` this is not a piece of cake , '' he told cnn , `` but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers . '' it has n't just been airbus that has been frantically preparing for the a380 launch . airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates , as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks . seventy airports are now ready , airbus has said . singapore 's changi airport , home to the singapore airlines a380 fleet , was the first , and when its new terminal 3 opens early next year , 19 gates across the three terminals will be a380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks . heathrow 's new terminal 5 will be able to handle four a380s at one time . british airways , the terminal 's sole occupant , recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants baa to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to terminal 5 to accommodate them . as willie walsh , ba 's ceo told cnn , `` we want to make sure that development is built with the a380 in mind . '' but whether the arrival of the a380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided . as cnn 's richard quest points out , while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly , demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as boeing 's up-coming 787 dreamliner . as richard quest says , `` there 's no doubt the a380 will sell , but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount airbus needs to make money .

149	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- if someone had asked kelly pless to describe herself three years ago , the word `` fit '' would have never crossed her mind . kelly pless weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest . she lost 95 pounds through diet and exercise . for most of her adult life , the 31-year-old graduate student from sunny isles beach , florida , has struggled with her weight . she started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school , she was carrying 215 pounds on her 5 ' 2 '' frame . prom , she says , was a nightmare . `` i had to go to three different stores to buy a dress , '' pless said . `` i had to buy the biggest , also the ugliest , prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit . '' after high school , she lost 50 pounds . but because she had n't done it in a healthy way , her weight crept back up to 220 pounds . at 28 , she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame . she reached her breaking point . `` i remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just was n't something i could be , '' said pless . `` i remember feeling like even if i tried , it was n't something my body was capable of . '' despite her doubts , pless decided to do something . fortunately she did n't have to look far for inspiration . see before and after weight loss photos from cnn.com i-reporters '' `` my manager at the kennedy space center ran marathons , and he was the same age as my father , '' she said . because her own father had diabetes and was in poor health , he seemed much older , she said . over the next three to four months , she began walking , without any real goal or expectation . pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more , everything would fall into place . `` at first , it was hard to start exercising because i was worried people would make fun of me , '' pless said . `` but then i just told myself , if that 's the worst that could happen ... i just got out there and did n't care . '' eventually , she started to run or `` shuffle '' as she jokingly recalls . she also adopted an `` eat to live '' philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit . `` i changed how i felt about food and what it meant to me , '' said pless , who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate . `` one of the first things i cut out was cakes and cookies . that was my weak spot . after a few months of cutting those things out , i focused more on portion control , '' said pless . `` i pretty much eat when i 'm hungry and do n't eat when i 'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are . make sure i 'm not eating out of boredom or -lsb- at -rsb- social events , i try to make sure i 'm not overeating , just because everyone else is . '' kelly pless shares her weight loss secrets '' pless pays close attention to societal pressure , which she believes is the reason many people overeat . restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size , she says . she makes sure she does n't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there . `` what 's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that are n't necessarily good for you , or actually change how you look at food . that was the hardest part for me . '' instead of giving in to the temptation or convenience of calorie-laden or fatty foods such as cheeseburgers from the drive-through , pless asks herself , `` what do i really want to eat ? or , what does my body really want right now ? '' all of the hard work and determination paid off . pless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1 1/2 years . as a result , she says , she 's healthier and more confident . she 's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders . '' -lsb- the -rsb- negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently . being fat was a good filter -- i 'm automatically treated better by people because i 'm thinner . society is so hard on people who are overweight or obese , '' said pless . `` now , those people think i 'm funnier or smarter . '' pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter . the first is in november in las vegas , nevada , and the second is in miami , florida , in january . forty pounds ago , the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin . but now , she said she ca n't imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require . `` running has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight , which is now about 125 pounds , '' said pless . if her past is any indication of her future success , pless will certainly cross the finish line . i-report : have you lost weight ? share your story , tips and photos e-mail to a friend .

152	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the confirmation of michael mukasey as attorney general was all but assured friday when two key democratic senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on `` waterboarding '' and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . sens. dianne feinstein of california and charles schumer of new york announced they would support the retired federal judge from new york just hours after the chairman of the judiciary committee announced his opposition to the nominee . feinstein and schumer are members of the senate judiciary committee , which is scheduled to vote on the mukasey nomination tuesday . if all the republican members of the committee also vote for mukasey , which is expected , his nomination will go before the full senate . a leading democrat , speaking on condition of anonymity , said wednesday mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the judiciary committee . schumer had praised the nomination of mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced mukasey as his choice to replace former attorney general alberto gonzales . gonzales gave up the post in september . `` this is an extremely difficult decision , '' schumer said . `` when an administration so political , so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge , we are never left with an ideal choice . judge mukasey is not my ideal choice . however , judge mukasey , whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him , is far better than anyone could expect from this administration . '' a number of democratic senators , however , have said they will oppose mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called `` waterboarding '' and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning . mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding `` repugnant , '' but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture . while saying `` serious questions have been raised about judge mukasey 's views on torture and on separation of powers , '' feinstein said she would support the nominee because the justice department needed fresh leadership . `` first and foremost , michael mukasey is not alberto gonzales . rather , he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the southern district of new york . `` i believe that judge mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments , allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by congress . '' just hours before feinstein and schumer announced their decisions , senate judiciary committee chairman sen. patrick leahy , d-vermont , announced he would vote against the mukasey nomination . watch sen. leahy explain why he ca n't support the mukasey nomination '' `` no american should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture , '' leahy said . `` waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the spanish inquisition . we prosecuted japanese war criminals for waterboarding after world war ii . `` i am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the department of justice . i like michael mukasey . i wish that i could support his nomination . but i can not . america needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one , not even the president , is above the law . '' president bush demanded the senate confirm mukasey during a speech thursday at the heritage foundation , an influential conservative think tank . `` in a time of war , it 's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place , '' the president said . the president has equated asking mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the cia-run interrogation program , whose details are classified . bush said the program does not violate u.s. bans on torture , but added that mukasey `` does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy . '' but leahy said `` judge mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret ` facts and circumstances . ' '' `` he was asked whether waterboarding is illegal . our law makes torture illegal , and waterboarding is torture , and it is illegal . it is frankly not dependent on any , quote , ` relevant facts and circumstances of the technique 's past or proposed use , ' '' he said , quoting from mukasey 's response to senators on the question . sources with knowledge of the cia-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding . but those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of khalid shaikh mohammed , now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al qaeda 's 2001 attacks on new york and washington . the practice was used by the spanish inquisition , cambodia 's khmer rouge and the world war ii japanese military , according to human rights watch . it is specifically banned in u.s. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the u.s. military . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ted barrett contributed to this report .
153	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- genarlow wilson , freed last week from a georgia prison , said he 's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors , even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier . genarlow wilson tells cnn on sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future . the 21-year-old , who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation , said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal . he had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day , he said sunday . `` it might 've been lesser time , but then again , i would have nowhere to go because i would have no home , '' wilson said during a cnn interview scheduled to air monday at 8 p.m. `` i would n't be able to stay with my mother because i have a little sister . you know , when you 're a sex offender you ca n't be around kids . basically , i ca n't even have kids myself , you know , so what is the point of life ? '' he asked . in 2005 , a jury found wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 new year 's eve party . wilson was 17 at the time of the party . watch wilson say why he rejected the plea deal '' the conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation . according to georgia attorney general thurbert baker , prosecutors in douglas county , georgia , offered wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record . defense attorney b.j. bernstein said in june that wilson rejected the deal because he did n't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence . the state legislature last year amended the law under which wilson was convicted , making such sexual encounters misdemeanors . however , the legislature did not make the law retroactive , so it had no effect on wilson 's sentence . now 21 , wilson was released friday after the state supreme court ruled 4-3 that the young man 's sentence `` constitutes cruel and unusual punishment . '' wilson said sunday he feels no `` negative energy '' toward district attorney david mcdade , who fought efforts to have wilson 's sentence reduced . instead , wilson said , he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies . he wants to major in sociology , he said , `` because i feel like i 've been living my major . '' the new genarlow wilson will be more conservative , more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him , he said . `` when it seems like you have everything , you know , you feel like you have no worries until it 's all gone , and i know what it feels like to be without and i do n't want to ever feel like that again , '' said the former honor student , football star and homecoming king . `` i do n't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison , period . '' though he called his sentence `` absurd , '' wilson said he understands that prosecutors `` were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law .

154	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- behind the state banquet and smiles from queen elizabeth and british prime minister gordon brown , king abdullah of saudi arabia 's visit to london this week caused a wave of dissent . the uk political elite boycotted events . demonstrators lined the mall . the uk foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son . and just days before he arrived , the saudi king accused british officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in london on july 2005 . whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate . but this was just part of the story . the saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two kingdoms over the last 20 years . saudi arabia is the uk 's largest trading partner in the middle east . and behind the usa , the uk is the second largest foreign investor in the kingdom . uk trade & investment has designated saudi arabia one of its 17 `` high growth markets '' along with uae and qatar in the region . as the nation diversifies its economy away from oil , commercial opportunities for uk thrive in a variety of sectors . saudi arabia is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities . the $ 26.6 billion king abdullah economic city -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents . the aim , says the saudi arabian general investment authority , is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment , and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities . the uk has , since the early 1990s , been one of the top five exporters to saudi arabia , behind usa , germany , china and japan . in 2007 , saudi arabian bank sabb predicts that uk exports to the kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $ 2.8 billion . while the balance of trade continues to be favor of the british , saudi arabia 's exports to britain are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap . this year , exports to britain are expected to reach a record high of $ 2.1 billion , says sabb . and this is n't all about oil . in the 1980s , three quarters of saudi exports to the uk were from oil , but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports . products being shipped to the uk include machinery , transport equipment , plastics , non-metallic minerals and , despite the uk 's dominance in the sector , chemicals . according to sabb , there are also more than 150 saudi-british joint ventures underway with a value of around $ 15 billion . as john sfakianakis , chief economist from sabb says , state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks , past and future . `` the biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 eurofighter typhoon jets that was sealed last week , '' says sfakianakis . the contract between the kingdom and the uk ministry of defence via bae is worth over almost $ 10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $ 19 billion for the deployment , maintenance and training . this comes less than a year after the uk government decided to call off a serious fraud office investigation into defense contracts with saudi arabia . this probe related to the sale of weapons by bae systems to saudi arabia in the 1980s . bae has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to saudi royals to win business . but as sfakianakis points out , any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations . `` the relationship is far deeper than that , '' he says . `` saudi arabia 's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense . everything else takes a subsidiary part in that .

156	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- banksy is britain 's most wanted artist -- his art sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars , but he continues to use public spaces as his main canvas , while all the time keeping his identity a secret . banksy 's latest piece in east london where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist . the guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils around britain and further afield for over ten years . last week ten of his original pieces were sold at bonham 's auction house in london for over $ 1 million , while on the other side of the city tower hamlets council authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets . from his beginnings as a graffiti artist in bristol , england , banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art . depicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats , his work is now sold now by major art galleries . lazarides gallery in london is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as `` a media star ... but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff . '' while he set out to lampoon the establishment , he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it . fans include hollywood a-listers , including brad pitt and angelina jolie and christina aguilera who bought three of his prints in 2006 , including one of queen victoria sitting on a woman 's face . the recent sales of his work put him on a par with jean-michel basquiat as the best-selling street artist . he is feted by art dealers and artists , including damien hirst , but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stunts such as hanging his own work in the tate gallery in london and the metropolitan museum of art in new york . it took the british museum eight days to discover the `` prehistoric '' rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in the british museum banksy has hung on a wall . there is often a political message with this work , too . he left an inflatable doll dressed as a guantanamo prisoner in disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the palestinian side of the west bank wall . despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work , banksy 's identity remains a mystery . as he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense , but also adds to his mystique . some things are know : he 's originally from bristol , is around 30 years old and called robert or robin banks , but it 's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator . he continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art . veteran british art critic brian sewell called banksy , `` a complete clown , and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art . '' bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city . other local authorities do n't feel the same way . tower hamlets and hackney councils in london have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets . his latest work painted on a wall in east london -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist 's response . but this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like . a passer-by took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work . a spokesperson for banksy refused to confirm it was him , but did say it was definitely his work . e-mail to a friend .
157	rome , italy -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the garbage crisis in naples encompasses the worst italian clichés , and in particular those of the southern part of this lovely peninsula : mismanagement , political interference , mafia profiteering and the ability of those responsible to deflect the attention and the blame elsewhere . naples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash . there is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this : everybody is competent enough -lrb- to find a solution -rrb- but nobody is responsible -lrb- for actually carrying it out -rrb- . in many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business . garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit . in naples , garbage is also good business , but in the sense that millions , if not billions , of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how . the problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash . the region 's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago , and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year . eight different commissioners have been appointed , but they have all failed to solve the problem . state of emergency means government money : $ 1.8 billion -lrb- more than $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem . it is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent . incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished , either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job , or else because magistrates stopped the work , pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement . one italian newspaper suggested that a good 20 % of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem . more worrying perhaps , is another suggestion : that the local mafia , known as the camorra , is taking advantage of the situation . as the crisis has worsened over the years , so the camorra 's profits , estimated now at around $ 1 billion -lrb- roughly $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , are alleged to have increased . how does the local mafia make money ? the naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation . once they receive the money , companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or , ironically , at regular city dumps , even if they are overflowing . the mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile . but why are citizens protesting now ? well , the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of naples and surrounding areas . the problem is that when the site was closed years ago , locals were promised that a golf course would be built there . as a result , many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site . they are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes . a rotten deal indeed . e-mail to a friend .
158	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- debra lafave , the former florida middle school teacher convicted of having sex with a student , violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker , a florida judge found thursday . debra lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager . she is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18 . but the judge did not send lafave to jail , saying the violation was `` not willful and substantial . '' `` please do n't come back , '' he scolded . dressed in a tailored , black pantsuit , lafave said she had `` innocent '' physical contact with a female co-worker she knew as under age 18 . watch lafave in the courtroom '' at the time , she and the 17-year-old hostess worked at danny boy 's , a small restaurant in the tampa , florida , area . lafave , 27 , pleaded guilty in november 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation . lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors . a tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court , prompting the prosecutor to observe , `` i think she 's accounted for . '' lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation . she referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just `` girl talk . '' lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers . `` i do n't speak that way about my personal life , '' she said . but she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a `` small group setting . '' while other co-workers socialized outside work , lafave said , the 17-year-old was not included in those outings . asked why she hugged the young co-worker , lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family . the contact came , she said , `` out of my good nature , that 's the way it worked . '' the contacts that led to thursday 's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of lafave 's court-ordered supervision . she received a verbal reprimand a year ago , according to testimony . when the behavior continued , her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation . she was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother 's beauty shop . in the past , lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment . e-mail to a friend .
159	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- 1 . the hamburger -- louis ' lunch , new haven , connecticut . this burger did not come from louis ' so ketchup is ok . there are competing claims for the coveted `` inventor of the hamburger '' title , but according to louis ' lunch -lrb- and the library of congress , for that matter -rrb- , this small new haven restaurant takes the prize . the story goes something like this : one day in 1900 , a rushed businessman asked owner louis lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run . lassen cooked up a beef patty , put it between some bread , and sent the man on his way . pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all-time , huh ? if you visit louis ' today , you 'll find that not much has changed . the lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant , the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves , and , just like then , there is absolutely no ketchup allowed . 2 . the fried twinkie -- the chipshop , brooklyn , new york . sometimes what counts is n't being the inventor , it 's being the innovator . take the fried twinkie , for example . the twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory -- has been around for ages , but when chipshop owner christopher sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack , dip it in batter , and deep-fry it , the twinkie took gluttony to new heights . even the new york times raved about how `` something magical '' happens when you taste the deep-fried twinkie 's `` luscious vanilla flavor . '' sell , who was trained in classical french cuisine , did n't start with the twinkie , though . in his native england , he fried up everything from m&m 's to mars bars . 3 . root beer float -- myers avenue red soda co. , cripple creek , colorado . if you thought what happened up on cripple creek only happened in song , you 're sorely mistaken . in august of 1893 , a failed gold-miner-turned-soda-company-owner named frank j. wisner was drinking a bottle of his myers avenue red root beer while looking up at cow mountain . just then , a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain , and wisner had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer . the new drink was christened the `` black cow '' and became an instant classic . today , of course , most of us call it a root beer float . 4 . corn dogs -- cozy dog drive in , springfield , illinois . in 1946 , ed waldmire , jr. , revolutionized the stick-meat world when he debuted the cozy dog -- the first corn dog on a stick . at first , he wanted to call his creation the `` crusty cur , '' but his wife convinced him to change the name to `` cozy dog . '' she felt people would n't want to eat something described as `` crusty . '' good call , mrs. waldmire . shortly after the cozy dog 's inception , the cozy dog drive in opened alongside old route 66 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since . 5 . the pizzeria -- lombardi 's , new york city , new york . pizza has existed in one form or another for a long time , but america got her first true pizzeria when gennaro lombardi opened up a small grocery store in new york city 's little italy . an employee named anthony `` totonno '' pero started selling pizzas out of the back , and in no time , lombardi 's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries . in 1905 , the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria , and it 's stayed that way ever since . well , almost . the original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later . on its 100th anniversary in 2005 , lombardi 's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it 'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie . needless to say , the line wrapped around the block . 6 . fat darrell -- r.u. hungry , new brunswick , new jersey . you may not know what the fat darrell is , but when you hear what it contains , you 'll understand why it 's truly a work of inspired genius . since 1979 , rutgers university has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the `` grease trucks . '' originally , they served a sandwich called the fat cat , which contained two cheeseburger patties , french fries , lettuce , tomato , and onions . then one night in 1997 , a hungry -lrb- and broke -rrb- student named darrell w. butler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers , mozzarella sticks , french fries , and marinara sauce on a sandwich . strangely , the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it , and the fat darrell became a mainstay at the grease trucks . hey , not any old sandwich gets to be named maxim magazine 's top `` meat hog '' sandwich . 7 . philly cheesesteak -- pat 's king of steaks , philadelphia , pennsylvania . philadelphia is known for many things -lrb- ben franklin , the liberty bell , and rocky , for starters -rrb- , but fine dining is not really its forte . that 's ok , though , because philly is the home of pat 's king of steaks , and pat 's king of steaks is where the philly cheesesteak was born . one day back in 1932 , hot dog stand owners pasquale -lrb- pat -rrb- and harry olivieri decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions . a cab driver who ate at pat 's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich , and with the first bite declared , `` hey , forget ` bout those hot dogs , you should sell these ! '' cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone , so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested . in no time , the modest stand turned into the pat 's that exists today . controversy remains , however , over who 's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak . pat 's claims it was the first to do so -lrb- in 1951 -rrb- , but across-the-street rival joe vento of geno 's steaks -lrb- opened 1966 -rrb- insists he added the finishing touches . 8 . onion rings -- pig stand , dallas , texas . according to most sources , the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a pig stand location in dallas accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter , then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination . now , you 'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain , but not pig stand . the company also lays claim to opening america 's first drive-in , inventing texas toast , and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs . not bad for a little outfit from texas . 9 . derby pie -- melrose inn , prospect , kentucky . a kentucky favorite , derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry-dough crust -- and that 's about all we know about it . why ? because the recipe is jealously guarded by the kern family . melrose inn manager george kern created derby pie in the mid-1950s with help from his parents , walter and leaudra , and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full-time . in fact , mrs. kern , being the crafty monopolist she was , copyrighted the name , and to this day , you can only get real `` derby-pie ® '' through kern 's kitchen , inc. . not only that , but a man from new england once handed leaudra a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home . she refused.i e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .
160	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush blasted the democratic-controlled congress on tuesday for having `` the worst record in 20 years .

'' bush criticized congress for not being able to send `` a single appropriations bill '' to him . `` they have n't seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it , '' he said . democrats quickly fired back . jim manley , senior aide to senate majority leader harry reid , said , `` taking advice from president bush about fiscal responsibility and getting things done for the american people is like taking hunting lessons from dick cheney . neither is a very good idea . '' rep. rahm emanuel , d-illinois , issued a statement saying , `` president bush 's rally this morning reminds us that congressional republicans remain ready and willing to rubber-stamp the bush agenda : no to children 's health care ; no to a new direction in iraq ; and no to investing in america 's future . the white house and congressional republicans want to continue the status quo . '' bush said the senate was `` wasting valuable time '' by taking up the children 's health insurance bill , which he had earlier vetoed . watch bush describe what he thinks congress is doing wrong '' house majority leader steny hoyer , d-maryland , issued a statement calling bush `` the biggest obstacle '' to extending health coverage to `` 10 million low-income , working-class american children . '' hoyer said gop house leaders need to `` stop posing for pictures , and sit down with democrats and republicans in congress who are working together to extend coverage to our children . '' the state children 's health insurance program measure passed in the house last week would expand the program by nearly $ 35 billion over five years , the same as the measure bush vetoed on october 3 . bush had proposed adding $ 5 billion to the program , and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state-run program . democratic leaders said the new version addresses republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving schip benefits ; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program ; and preventing adults from receiving benefits . the program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for medicaid , the federal health insurance program for the poor , but who ca n't afford private insurance . democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million , paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes . bush said congress knows the current version of the children 's health bill `` does not have a chance , '' to get enough votes to override another veto . hoyer accused bush of breaking a promise he made in 2004 to extend coverage under the schip program . `` now , congress must do what the president said he would do , '' he said in his statement . the senate could vote on the bill as early as tuesday . bush also threatened to veto a `` three-bill pileup . '' `` there are now reports that congressional leaders may be considering combining the veterans and department of defense appropriations bills , and then add a bloated labor , health and education spending bill to both of them , '' he said . `` congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner , '' he said . bush also urged congress to send him a `` clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill . '' `` they ought to get me a bill that funds among other things bullets and body armor , '' he said . bush also criticized congress for trying to `` hold hostage '' funding for troops . `` it would be irresponsible to not give our troops the resources they need to get their job done because congress was unable to get its job done , '' he said . hoyer 's release said bush 's comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility `` ring hollow . '' `` the fact is , this administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in american history , turning record surpluses into record deficits and adding more than $ 3 trillion to the national debt , '' he said . `` democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today because we believe our government must pay for the things it purchases and not force our children to pay our bills . the fight over 2008 appropriations bills is not a fight over spending . it is a fight over priorities .

'' at u.s. president george w. bush 's texas ranch , white house spokesman gordon johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the united states . `` militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities , so this is not entirely surprising , '' he said . but the sorties are likely to add to western concern about russia 's growing assertiveness . that trend has prompted some u.s. policymakers to draw parallels with the cold war . putin caused a stir this year by saying russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in europe if washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern europe . russian diplomats have clashed with the united states and european governments on issues such as kosovo , energy , and moscow 's treatment of its ex-soviet neighbors . western military leaders have said this year that russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period . one western defense official called the flights `` a little bit of chest-pounding , trying to let people know russia is back in the game '' . putin said that when russia had cut its flights in 1992 , other military powers had not reciprocated . `` flights by other countries ' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the russian federation , '' putin said . that appeared to be a swipe at the u.s. and nato , whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions . as putin spoke to reporters and television cameras , four russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while russian tanks trundled behind him , even though the exercises had ended long before . during the cold war , russian long-range bombers , which can carry strategic nuclear weapons , played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with western air forces . earlier this month russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the pacific island of guam , where the u.s. military has a base , and `` exchanged smiles '' with u.s. pilots scrambled to track them . the pentagon said the russian aircraft had not come close enough to u.s. ships to prompt american aircraft to react . in july , two russian tu-95 `` bear '' bombers made unusually long sorties over the north sea , leading norway and britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them . russia 's air force said later it was a routine flight . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
164	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- authorities in azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical islamic terror plot against the u.s. embassy in the capital , baku , prompting the facility to close its doors to the public monday , azerbaijan and u.s. officials told cnn . the bibi heybat mosque , just outside the capital baku . as a precaution , britain also shut its embassy in baku to the public on monday `` following security concerns nearby , '' britain 's foreign office said . the terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group , two u.s. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for azerbaijan 's national security ministry told cnn . u.s. state department spokesman sean mccormack stressed that the details `` are still unfolding , '' and the threat `` may or may not be '' linked to the saturday raid . `` there were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the u.s. embassy there , '' mccormack said , noting that no specific individuals were targeted . several days ago , an azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical islamic group seized four assault rifles , a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of baku , the ministry spokesman and u.s. officials said . government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on saturday in the village of mastaga , about 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- northeast of baku , the spokesman said . one suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep , the spokesman said . several others are still at large , he added . he said the terror plot also targeted azerbaijani government buildings . the u.s. embassy in baku issued a warden message warning americans in azerbaijan to take precautions . `` while there is no information at this time that other american or western interests in azerbaijan are being targeted , the u.s. embassy encourages americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security , '' it said . azerbaijan is a former soviet republic that borders the caspian sea , and lies just north of iran . mccormack said u.s. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume . he said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on tuesday , as well . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's igor malakhov in moscow , zain verjee in washington and roger clark in london contributed to this report .
165	-lrb- instyle -rrb- -- it all boils down to this . it does n't really matter all that much what hot , nubile french maverick has set the fashion world on fire . or which milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to angkor wat that 's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist . or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries . because , in the end , he 's ralph lauren , and we 're not . ralph lauren has his eye on china and japan . for four decades no other designer has had a greater impact , not only on the way american men and women dress but also on the way they imagine , seek and indulge in the good life , than the former tie salesman from the bronx . `` those ties were handmade , by the way , '' recalls lauren . `` back then , ties , even designer ones , did n't sell for more than $ 5 apiece . mine were $ 12 to $ 15 . such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary . '' and ironic . because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony , lauren originally named his company polo because `` it was the sport of kings . it was glamorous , sexy and international . '' see his designs '' in the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after marco polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of lauren 's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial . lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire , not just to be a success but to look like one before you 'd even achieved your goal . what 's more , lauren made it look as easy as fred astaire dancing down a staircase . `` what matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible , '' says the designer . `` when i look at the people i 've admired over the years , the ultimate stars , like frank sinatra , cary grant and astaire , the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency , whose naturalness is part of their excitement . and when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there , the ones you believe in and the ones you remember , like chanel and armani , are the ones that stand for something . fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality . and it 's an image that can change , that can evolve . it does n't reinvent itself every two years . '' however , with a media that is insatiable for the new , the now and the next , being steadfast does n't always make for good copy . `` the spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer , '' lauren admits . `` and that 's fine . but the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else . we work real hard at that . it 's about getting your message out to the consumer . it 's about getting their trust , but also getting them excited , again and again . my clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- are n't concepts . they go into stores . our stores . thankfully , we have lots of them , '' says lauren . `` what i rely on is people walking into my store saying , ' i want your clothes . ' '' well , if all of lauren 's customers shouted that together , he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers . lauren 's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet , on ski slopes and boats , at wimbledon and elsewhere . it furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables . it 's on the bed , in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables , thanks to the tome ralph lauren -lrb- rizzoli -rrb- , celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career . but far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his colorado-ranch sunset , the designer is going even more global . `` americans have a real inferiority about their own style . we 've brought sportswear to the world , and yet we have a long way to go . '' already in milan , london , paris and moscow , lauren has more stores planned for china , japan ... oh , everywhere . `` there are n't enough americans out there , '' he says . who better to start with than ralph ? just as long as he does n't let on that most of us still ca n't play a lick of polo . e-mail to a friend . get a free trial issue of instyle - click here ! copyright © 2007 time inc. . all rights reserved .
166	los angeles , california -- one of the bigger difficulties any first-time buyer faces is purchasing a car that does n't scream `` first-time '' to friends , relatives and co-workers , or indeed to the buyer each time they step into an ill-chosen purchase . a `` shark '' that races down roads . to break from the boring econobox , here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $ 20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first-time owner . hyundai tiburon . if you did n't know already , tiburon means `` shark '' in spanish , and it 's not hard to see how hyundai 's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first-time buyer and snare them quickly . like an instantly recognizable dorsal fin , the tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low-slung sportster that wo n't bust a first-time buyer 's wallet , though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they 're pushed back into those tight-hugging bucket seats . the startling hyundai-designed looks boast a touch of italian styling uncommon for its bracket . mazda mazdaspeed3 . a bona-fide pocket rocket , any first-time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the mazdaspeed3 , part of the asian carmaker 's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from european carmakers . this one is n't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings , but do n't let any youngster tell you it does n't have what it takes to make their peers jealous . the mazdaspeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph . its secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood . another hidden gem is its seven-speaker bose stereo . pontiac g5 gt coupe . much like the fantastic chevy cobalt ss , its younger sister pontiac g5 gt boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first-time buyer 's wallet . the g5 gt has been tweaked just slightly from its sister ss -- like the difference between ashlee and jessica simpson -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance . both are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add-ons . a new grille entirely , like a phantom , may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd . the gt 's inline-four 2.4-liter 173-hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds . gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook . ford mustang v6 . a revamped chassis is the key to why ford 's mustang has become an outstanding product at a price that 's hard to beat . a tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer , craggier front end . some might of course call us heretics for picking a v6 over the famous eight-cylinder included in the gt package but , to be honest , the v6 performs admirably , pushes out 210hp and emits a low-down growl that sounds wonderful . and it 's still a mustang . civic coupe . a civic hatch was my second car -lrb- after a very short-lived vw rabbit -rrb- . the coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the civic 's surprisingly roomy front cabin , its enjoyable handling and maneuverability , first-class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end . standard features include a 350-watt premium sound system , a touch-screen satellite-navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the cd player , and a slot for a computer memory card . it 's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun . scion xb . on the heels of its 2004 release , toyota 's hipster scion brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year , this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company 's fj cruiser . wide rear pillars , wraparound headlights and bumper define the second-generation variant , which comes dripping with gadgetry inside , as well as leaving plenty of room for after-market customization . this one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort . other notable features include a central console that fits in a dvd player alongside a backlit gps sat-nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors . honda fit . a co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up saturn on a left turn into oncoming traffic . ouch . so it technically was n't her first car , but for many buyers , it will be . energetic , filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet , the fit looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect . you do n't get a third row of seats in there but , with the back row folded flat , it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper . other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear-seat headrests , while gas mileage is , as expected , very good indeed . e-mail to a friend .
167	tehran , iran -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes , russian president vladimir putin said on tuesday during the first visit to the country by a kremlin leader since 1943 . putin , right , is greeted by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad following his arrival in tehran . putin , who is in tehran to attend a summit of caspian sea nations , said that he and the other leaders agreed that `` peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed '' in the region . `` the iranians are cooperating with russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives , '' he said . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the u.s. and its allies to impose stronger u.n. sanctions against tehran . on monday , u.s. defense secretary robert gates reiterated the bush administration 's stance that `` all options '' must be kept `` on the table '' in confronting the threats posed by iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time u.s. adversary . `` we should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program , their willingness to live up to their rhetoric , their intentions for iraq , or their ambitions in the gulf region , '' gates said in a speech to the jewish institute for national security affairs . the leaders of iran , russia , kazakhstan , turkmenistan and azerbaijan also met tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the caspian sea -- the world 's largest inland body of water . speaking afterwards , putin said that no caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the u.s. planned to use azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against iran , the associated press reported . `` we are saying that no caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any caspian state , '' putin said . `` the caspian sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the caspian states , therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here , '' added iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . putin , defying reports of an assassination plot against him , was greeted by iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as he stepped off his plane at tehran 's mehrabad airport . during a news conference monday after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in wiesbaden , germany , putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans . `` of course i will travel to iran , '' putin said . `` if i reacted to these kinds of rumors every time , i could never leave the house . '' iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against putin , with a foreign ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the putin visit baseless . `` spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and can not damage the trend of the prepared programs , '' spokesman mohammadali hosseini told the iranian fars news agency . hosseini blamed the rumor on western media , particularly the u.s. media , saying the report was `` made up by the enemies of relations between iran and russia to create a psychological war . '' putin 's visit is the first by a leader in the kremlin to iran since joseph stalin 's world war ii conference meeting with u.s. president franklin d. roosevelt and british prime minister winston churchill . `` putin 's trip to tehran is a show of russia 's independence in global affairs . putin , who approaches the end of his term , wants to demonstrate that he would n't cave in to the u.s. pressure , '' said alexander pikayev , an expert on iran with russia 's institute for world economy and international relations , in a report carried by ap . putin 's schedule also includes meetings with ahmadinejad and iran 's supreme leader , ali khamenei , ap said . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .
168	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- erik prince , the chairman and ceo of blackwater usa , appeared tuesday before the house committee on oversight and government reform . erik prince , ceo and chairman of blackwater usa , is sworn in tuesday at a congressional hearing . the committee convened amid an fbi investigation into a september 16 shootout involving blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of iraqi civilians . following is a transcript of prince 's opening statement : . chairman -lsb- henry -rsb- waxman , -lsb- d-california -rsb- , congressman -lsb- thomas -rsb- davis , -lsb- r-virginia -rsb- , members of the committee , my name is eric prince , and i am the chairman and ceo of the prince group and blackwater usa . blackwater 's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to america 's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect americans in harm 's way overseas . under the direction and oversight of the united states government , blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the united states . words alone can not express the respect i have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend u.s. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions . i am proud to be there to represent them today . after almost five years in active service as a u.s. navy seal , i founded blackwater in 1997 . i wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues . ten years later , blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the united states military and law enforcement agencies every day . after 9/11 , when the u.s. began its stabilization efforts in afghanistan and then iraq , the united states government called upon blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas . blackwater responded immediately . we are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country . blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans , many of whom have recent military deployments . no individual ever protected by blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured . there is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men . at the same time , 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for blackwater and its affiliates . numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed . the entire blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives . our thoughts and our prayers are with their families . the areas of iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging . blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within iraq . we 're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 american military personnel and thousands of innocent iraqis . any incident where americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep american officials and dignitaries safe , including visiting members of congress . in doing so , more american service members are available to fight the enemy . blackwater shares the committee 's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting u.s. operations . the company 's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes , treaties and regulations of the united states . blackwater looks forward to working with congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented . the worldwide personnel protection services contract , which has been provided to this committee , was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance , including the hiring , vetting guidelines , background checks , screening , training standards , rules of force and conduct standards . in iraq , blackwater reports to the embassy 's regional security officer , or rso . all blackwater movements and operations are directed by the rso . in conjunction with internal company procedures and controls , the rso ensures that blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions , as well as any applicable laws and regulations . we have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in iraq as part of our nation 's total force . blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions . my understanding of the september 16 incident is that the department of state and the fbi are conducting a full investigation , but those results are not yet available . we at blackwater welcome the fbi review announced yesterday , and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions . i just want to put some other things in perspective . a recent report from the department of state stated that in 2007 blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone , areas outside the green zone in iraq , and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged , or less than 3 percent of all movements . in 2006 , blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the red zone . weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions . to the extent there is any loss of innocent life , ever , let me be clear that i consider that tragic . every life , whether american or iraqi , is precious . i stress to the committee and to the american public , however , that i believe we acted appropriately at all times . i am prepared to answer your questions . e-mail to a friend .

170	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- with the election of the next president a year away , sen. hillary clinton remains the person to beat , a cnn/opinion research corporation poll released monday suggests . as the countdown begins to november 4 , 2008 , the new york democrat continues to dominate the race for the democratic presidential nomination , and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the gop front-runner , former new york mayor rudy giuliani . but clinton 's path to the white house is in no way certain . clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week , and her rivals for the democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on iraq , iran and other major issues . the republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the democratic front-runner , with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping clinton . the attacks may be working . the cnn/opinion research polls suggests that clinton 's support has slipped from its height one month ago . watch cnn 's bill schneider on the latest poll numbers '' `` clinton 's strength is about where it was throughout the summer , indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that obama has not yet cut into her core constituency , '' cnn political director keating holland said . clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely democratic voters interviewed for the poll . her closest rival , sen. barack obama of illinois , was the top choice of 25 percent , and former sen. john edwards of north carolina has 14 percent . all other democratic candidates were in single digits . new mexico gov. bill richardson was backed by 4 percent , sen. joe biden of delaware by 3 percent , sen. christopher dodd by 2 percent , ohio rep. dennis kucinich by 2 percent and former alaska sen. mike gravel was at 1 percent . the poll involved 467 interviews conducted on november 2-4 with democrats or independents who lean democratic . the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . view the poll results '' in an october cnn/opinion research poll , clinton was supported by 51 percent of democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over obama . during last week 's democratic debate , clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow democratic presidential rivals , who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the iowa caucus in early january . edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate , criticizing clinton for her stance on iraq , iran and social security . `` the american people ... deserve a president of the united states that they know will tell them the truth and wo n't say one thing one time and something different at a different time , '' edwards said . edwards has also accused clinton of being a `` corporate democrat '' too willing to defend a `` corrupt '' washington establishement . `` we desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in washington that 's become broken , corruption has crept into it , and we have to tell the truth about that , '' edwards said monday . `` if you defend that system , i do n't believe you can bring about the change that america needs . '' in the republican presidential race , giuliani continues to be the leading candidate , with the backing of 28 percent of the republican primary voters polled . former sen. fred thompson of tennessee was backed by 19 percent . sen. john mccain of arizona was the top pick of 16 percent , and former massachusetts gov. mitt romney had 11 percent . of the remaining republican candidates , former arkansas gov. mike huckabee received 10 percent , texas rep. ron paul 5 percent , california rep. duncan hunter 4 percent and colorado rep. tom tancredo 3 percent . the poll involved telephone interviews with 397 republicans or independents who lean republican . the poll 's margin of error was 5 percentage points . in a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners , clinton leads giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent . that lead has increased since october , when clinton led giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent . `` the overall political environment seems to favor the democrats , partly because democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood , which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party , '' holland said . only 42 percent of americans think things are going well , while 58 percent think things are going badly , the poll found . `` the public is not just pessimistic about the country -- americans are angry , '' holland said . `` more than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country . '' clinton 's lead over giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances , the poll found . in a three-way race , clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters , giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent . the poll 's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent . `` my analysis of it is that -lsb- a third-party candidate -rsb- is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me , '' giuliani said . `` you know it is a tactic , and a legitimate one . people have to think about that and consider it . '' the lack of enthusiasm for giuliani , particularly by social conservatives , could spell trouble for the gop next year if he becomes the nominee , holland said . `` only 27 percent of republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if giuliani won the gop nod , and the remaining gop candidates fare even worse , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .

172	paris , france -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- three french journalists charged in an alleged plot to kidnap african children for adoption in europe arrived in paris on sunday , hours after french president nicolas sarkozy held emergency talks in chad . but 14 other people remained in custody in the african nation , some facing serious charges that could send them to jail for up to 20 years . the journalists were among seven europeans a chadian judge released sunday , including a spanish flight crew , whom sarkozy dropped off in a brief stop in madrid on his way back from chad . all were arrested last week after workers from zoe 's ark -- a french-based charity group -- were accused of trying to fly 103 children out of chad in a kidnapping and adoption operation . watch a report on how the events unfolded '' some of the children may never return to their families because it is too difficult to determine their backgrounds , red cross spokeswoman inah kaloga told cnn on friday . those who remain under arrest in chad are six members of the french charity , four chadians and four remaining members of the flight crew . some face kidnapping and fraud charges . zoe 's ark leader eric breteau testified saturday to a court in the chadian capital that the three journalists and the flight crew of seven spaniards and a belgian were not involved in the alleged plot , court witnesses told cnn . at least some of the flight crew are scheduled to testify before a judge on monday . the three journalists initially had been charged with complicity in the alleged kidnapping attempt . it 's not clear if the charges against them have been dropped . watch the freed europeans leave chad '' in a joint news conference with spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on sunday at madrid 's torrejon air force base , sarkozy expressed satisfaction that some of those detained had been released . at the same time , however , he told reporters , `` we should respect the sovereignty of chad . '' zapatero thanked sarkozy for dropping the four spanish flight crew members off in their home country , and thanked chadian president idriss deby for allowing them to return . after his emergency talks in chad , sarkozy stressed the scandal would not affect the strong relations between the two countries or affect the planned deployment of a european force to protect refugees from sudan 's darfur region who have fled to chad and the neighboring central african republic . sarkozy also said he hoped the six remaining french nationals -- all from zoe 's ark -- would face trial in france . the charity says that the children were orphans from the darfur region -- where the united nations estimates 200,000 people have been killed in four years of conflict -- and that the group was taking them to host families in france . but after preliminary interviews with the children , aid agencies said thursday it appeared most of them probably are not orphans and not from sudan , but instead come from villages on the chadian side of the border with sudan . the children are staying in an abeche orphanage while aid agencies and government officials try to find out where they came from -- a challenge hindered by the number of children , their youth , and the volatile situation in the region . a father of three of the children allegedly kidnapped told a french newspaper he put his children into the charity 's care after he was told they would be educated at a school under construction in a nearby town . the chadian man , who gave his name as arbab , told le parisien on sunday that workers from zoe 's ark had visited his village three times . `` they never said they would take away our children , '' he told the newspaper . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's nic robertson and al goodman contributed to this report .

'' `` he will abide scrupulously by whatever this court decides , '' the attorney said . simpson faces trial april 7 on 12 criminal counts , including conspiracy , kidnapping , robbery , burglary , coercion and assault with a deadly weapon . the charges stem from a september 13 incident at a las vegas hotel in which he allegedly stole sports memorabilia he said belonged to him from dealers alfred beardsley and bruce fromong . according to earlier testimony , beardsley and fromong were offering more than 600 simpson-related items for sale , including ties simpson wore during his criminal trial for the 1994 murders of his ex-wife , nicole brown simpson , and her friend ron goldman . simpson was acquitted in that trial . e-mail to a friend .

177	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. barack obama on thursday criticized a recent vote by democratic presidential rival sen. hillary clinton as helping to give president bush a `` blank check '' to take military action against iran . sen. barack obama says sen. hillary clinton has shown `` flawed '' judgment . `` we know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what congress says , '' obama said in an interview with cnn 's wolf blitzer . last month , clinton voted to support a resolution declaring iran 's islamic revolutionary guard corps , an elite part of the iranian military , a foreign terrorist group . -lrb- the nonbinding amendment to the defense authorization act passed by a 76-22 vote . -rrb- . obama said he would have voted against the measure but did n't because he was campaigning in new hampshire at the time . he said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the senate . `` this is a problem '' related to running for president , he said . obama said clinton also had shown `` flawed '' judgment during the vote to authorize the iraq war five years ago . `` we know that there was embodied in this legislation , or this resolution sent to the senate , language that would say our iraqi troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with iran , '' obama said . `` now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it , we do n't want to repeat that mistake . '' clinton on thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on new hampshire public radio , saying `` what i voted on was a nonbinding resolution . it 's not an amendment . it 's not a law . '' while clinton was campaigning sunday in new hampton , iowa , an audience member at a town hall-style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the iran measure and asked why she had n't learned from past `` mistakes . '' calling `` the premise of the question '' wrong , the senator from new york argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed . the sanctions , clinton said , will in turn `` send a clear message to the leadership '' and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts . earlier this month , clinton also co-sponsored legislation with sen. jim webb , d-virginia , that would prohibit military operations against iran without congressional approval . obama 's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77-23 senate vote that authorized the president to use force against iraq . obama , then an illinois state senator , spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time . clinton 's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them , obama said . watch as obama questions clinton 's judgment '' `` i do n't think it disqualified her , but i think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment , '' obama said . `` it speaks to how we will make decisions going forward . `` i think her judgment was flawed on this issue . '' obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with clinton , whom many political observers view as the front-runner for the democratic nomination . `` there 's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign , '' obama said . `` the first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where i 've been and what i am about . `` in this next phase , we want to make sure that voters understand that on big issues , like the decision to go into the war in iraq , i had real differences with the other candidates , and that reflects on my judgment . '' another leading democratic candidate , john edwards , also voted in 2002 to authorize force in iraq while he was then a senator from north carolina . he later called his vote a mistake . in a veiled swipe at clinton , obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer `` something new , as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we 've become so accustomed to , that frankly the american people are sick of . '' obama would not say whether he would consider clinton as his running mate should he become the democratic party 's nominee . `` i think sen. clinton is a very capable person , '' he said . `` right now , my goal is to make sure i am the nominee , and she is still the senator from new york .

181	las vegas , nevada -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a young girl shown on video being sexually assaulted was raped while in the care of a baby sitter her mother hired , the mother 's attorney said tuesday . chester arthur stiles , 37 , of nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a young girl . the mother did not know her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until last friday , jerry t. donohue said . `` a family friend called her and said , ` my god , you need to turn on the tv . i believe that is your daughter , ' '' he said . donohue said the mother recognized the suspect , chester arthur stiles , 37 , a former animal trainer . the abuse most likely occurred while the mother - a single woman working six days a week - was at work , donohue said . the attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is , but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation . earlier , officials had said the girl , who is now 7 , was 3-years-old at the time the video was made . but donohue said tuesday , `` to my understanding , the abuse occurred before she was 3 years old . '' the mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone . `` i want to ask you , the press , to respect my family 's privacy and to not attempt to contact my daughter or myself , '' the mother said in a written statement read by her attorney . watch donohue read the mother 's statement '' the mother also said she is cooperating with investigators and that her daughter `` is safe and healthy . '' the girl 's videotaped rape set off a nationwide search last week . she was found friday with family in las vegas , nevada , after thousands of tips poured in . professionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be `` healthy and fine and happy , '' the lawyer said . the lawyer said neither he nor the mother has watched the videotape . asked whether the mother is thankful to the news media for having published the girl 's picture so that authorities were able to identify her , donohue said , `` not really ... there 's some things maybe you do n't want to know . '' still , he said , he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice . `` speaking as a father myself , i wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gun in his mouth , '' he said , referring to such an outcome as `` wild-west justice . '' meanwhile , the intense manhunt for stiles continued tuesday . on monday , stiles ' former girlfriend , tina allen , told cnn she thinks she is the reason stiles came in contact with the girl and is `` mortified '' by the allegations against him . allen said she and stiles were in an on-again , off-again relationship for 10 years until recently , when she called it off . `` he said he 'd been in the navy and , you know , i was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what i thought they needed to be , '' allen said . allen said she took stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived . also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter , who allegedly was victimized by stiles . `` i 'm disgusted . i 'm ashamed , embarrassed , mortified , '' allen said of the alleged rape . `` i regret every , every step i ever took , i feel bad for the baby . '' the fbi is also seeking stiles , a resident of pahrump , nevada , in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 . pahrump is about 60 miles west of las vegas . a man who said he found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in sunday to nye county officials . darren tuck , a nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police , faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography . e-mail to a friend .

'' `` it was an attempted robbery , aggravated robbery , '' he said . bradford `` was targeted because of some information that was out there and the fact that they believed he had some cash , or he had something that they wanted .

183	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former detainees of immigration and customs enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation . raymond soeoth , pictured here with his wife , says he was injected with drugs by ice agents against his will . one of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug haldol , which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses . doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered . two immigrants , raymond soeoth of indonesia and amadou diouf of senegal in west africa , told cnn they were injected with the drugs against their will . both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the american civil liberties union against the government . they are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages . watch why the former detainees claim abuse '' dr. paul appelbaum , a professor of psychiatry , law and ethics at columbia university , reviewed both men 's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered . `` i 'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way , '' said appelbaum , who also serves as a member of the american academy of psychiatry and the law . `` that is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world . '' the allegations of ice forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by sen. joe lieberman , i-connecticut , during the re-nomination hearing of ice chief julie myers . `` the information the committee has received from ice regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ice may have violated its own detention standards , '' lieberman spokeswoman leslie phillips told cnn in an e-mail . `` senator lieberman intends to follow up with ice to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so . '' aclu attorney ahilan arulanantham , who is representing soeoth and diouf , said , `` it would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who is n't even mentally ill . ... but here , it 's happening on u.s. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport . '' responding to lieberman 's written questions , myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had `` medical escorts '' for deportation since 2003 . from october last year to the end of april this year , she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process . of those , 33 detainees received medication `` because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self , '' she said . `` first , i am aware of , and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ice detention standards , '' myers said . she added no detainee should be `` involuntarily medicated without court order , '' except in emergency situations . but both soeoth and diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior . soeoth , a christian minister from indonesia , spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected . hours before he was to be sent back home on december 7 , 2004 , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days . see the document that shows soeoth was injected . `` they pushed me on the bench , they opened my pants , and they just give me injection , '' he said through broken english . he says he was taken to los angeles international airport while in this drug-induced stupor , but two hours before takeoff , airline security refused to transport him , so ice agents returned him to his cell at terminal island near los angeles . terminal island , once a federal prison , is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation . soeoth 's medical records indicate he was injected with cogentin and haldol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness . in the records , the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark soeoth denies ever making . ice said in a written statement it could n't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation . `` department of homeland security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees , '' the ice statement said . `` only trained and qualified medical professionals , including officers of the u.s. public health service , may prescribe or administer medication . '' but , diouf says , he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported . he said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his u.s. government escorts would n't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country . see diouf 's stay of deportation document . that 's when , he says , `` i was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes . '' a government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders . in both cases , diouf and soeoth remain in the united states pending a decision in the case . if they lose , they may land back in the hands of ice , once again facing deportation . soeoth says he 's traumatized by what happened . `` i know this country -lsb- is -rsb- very generous to immigrants , '' he says . `` what they did to me was very , very bad .

184	tampa , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some christian congregations , particularly in lower income , urban areas , are turning to an unlikely source for help -- the church of scientology . rev , charles kennedy uses scientology founder l. ron hubbard 's book during a friday night sermon . scientologists do not worship god , much less jesus christ . the church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult . so why are observant christians embracing some of its teachings ? two pastors who spoke recently with cnn explained that when it comes to religion , they still preach the core beliefs of christianity . but when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world , borrowing from scientology helps . the rev. charles kennedy , of the glorious church of god in christ , a pentecostal church in tampa , florida , and the rev. james mclaughlin , of the wayman chapel african methodist episcopal church in houston , texas , are among the theological hybrids . watch rev. kennedy preach '' they say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting , secretive ways and rigid theology . as men of god rooted in christian values , they do not see scientology as a threat to their faith , but rather as a tool to augment it . scientology was founded in the 1950s by l. ron hubbard , a science fiction writer . followers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans . although the church says there is a supreme being , its practices do not include worshipping god . `` i 'm looking for solutions , and the people that i help , they do n't ask me who l. ron hubbard is , '' said mclaughlin , who works with addicts . `` you know what they say ? ` thank god . ' '' critic rick ross , a court-certified scientology expert , sees something more sinister at work . he warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal -- new recruits . `` their hope is that through these programs , people will become more interested in l. ron hubbard , what else mr. hubbard had to offer , and this will lead them eventually to scientology , '' ross said . the church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cult-like mind control . it is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers . and according to published reports , scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups . kennedy , mclaughlin and a handful of other christian church leaders -- no one can say how many -- are finding answers to their communities ' needs in scientology 's social programs . for kennedy , it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at the church of scientology 's spiritual headquarters in clearwater , florida . he was introduced to a book called `` the way to happiness '' -- hubbard 's 64-page , self-described `` common sense guide to better living . '' in the book , which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle , kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income african-american congregation . he said the book 's 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportunity . kennedy knew that before he could introduce any scientology-related text to his congregation , he would have to prove that it did not contradict his christian beliefs . and so , he found scripture to match each of the 21 principles . now kennedy uses `` the way to happiness '' as a how-to supplement to his sermons . he believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient scriptures taken from the bible . when asked whether scientology 's values contradict the religion of jesus christ , kennedy replies , `` sometimes yes . sometimes no . '' but he says his congregation can relate to `` the way to happiness . '' kennedy admits other pastors have criticized him , but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him . he insists that he has witnessed the changes `` the way to happiness '' has inspired in people . he also maintains that the scientologists , many of whom he calls friends , are successful at outreach and getting desired results . at kennedy 's c. l. kennedy center , free tutoring based on hubbard 's `` study tech '' philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults . kennedy 's daughter , jimirra , is one of the instructors . she said `` study tech '' and the scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman . though jimirra kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of scientology , she still considers herself , at least in part , scientologist . `` we say this all the time and i know my father says this , but i am like a pentecostal scientologist , that 's what we are . '' critics like ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines . they consider it a marketing win for scientology . in houston , mclaughlin says he is not one to argue with success . driven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his community , mclaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered `` narconon , '' scientology 's nonprofit drug rehab center , in 2001 . mclaughlin trained at narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch `` first step faith step , '' a program that combines hubbard 's methods with the teachings of christianity . he claims a 70 - to 80-percent rehabilitation success rate . kennedy and mclaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to scientology . `` i think that they truly believe that this may help their communities , but in my opinion , they 're naïve , '' ross said . scientologists , he added , `` have their own agenda . '' the church of scientology would not grant cnn an interview , nor would its representatives answer questions about the hubbard-based programs . e-mail to a friend .

189	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- national hurricane center director bill proenza left his position monday , just days after nearly half of the nhc staff signed a petition calling for his ouster . hurricane center bill proenza left his job as director monday . proenza is still employed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration -- a parent organization of the nhc -- but he is currently on leave , said noaa spokesman anson franklin . deputy director ed rappaport has been temporarily placed in charge . proenza , 62 , became the director in january after the retirement of max mayfield . proenza caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite called quikscat . the satellite is five years beyond its life expectancy and operating on a backup transmitter . proenza said if it were to fail , forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent . he said washington reprimanded him for the remarks : `` they wanted me to be quiet about it . '' but one of the center 's longtime forecasters said proenza 's comments were misguided . `` quikscat is another tool that we use to forecast , '' lixion avila said . `` the forecast will not be degraded if we do n't have the quikscat . '' last week , the commerce department launched an unscheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staff 's dissatisfaction started to become public . his staffers on thursday issued a petition calling for him to step down . watch how proenza lost the confidence of his staff '' the petition said the center 's `` effective functioning '' is at stake as the atlantic hurricane season heads toward its peak . `` the undersigned staff ... has concluded that the center needs a new director , and with the heart of the hurricane season fast approaching , urges the department of commerce to make this happen as quickly as possible , '' said the petition , which was signed by twenty-three people , including four of five senior hurricane specialists . hurricane center staffers told cnn 's john zarella they were unhappy not only about his comments about the quikscat , but also about the environment at the center -- one characterized by closed doors and the public airing of dirty laundry . proenza on friday told cnn he had contacted his superiors in washington about `` ways to move forward , '' but added , `` i am not going to resign .

190	el calaboz , texas -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- eloisa tamez said she is n't scared anymore , just determined . `` i am not backing down , '' she said . the u.s. government wants to build a border fence like this one . about 100 landowners are fighting it . tamez owns three acres of land along the texas-mexico border where the department of homeland security would like to build a border fence . the property is a remnant of a 12,000-acre grant from spain to her family in 1767 , before the united states even existed . `` it is my history . it is my heritage , '' tamez said . this week , the justice department began legal action against landowners and municipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land . tamez expects she will be sued sometime soon , but she is not intimidated . asked how long she will fight , she said , `` as long as i have to . '' michael chertoff , the secretary of homeland security , said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like tamez . `` can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual ? '' chertoff told cnn . `` i do n't think i can accept that . '' watch chertoff say it 's `` civic responsibility '' to give up land '' chertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs . he also argues it will increase the safety of border patrol agents who have faced increasing violence . the government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the mexican border , including 370 miles of it by the end of this year . about 70 miles of fence is to be built in the rio grande valley by year 's end , if the government gets its way . the rio grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border , but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across . on the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so . piles of underwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across . the swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags . then they disappear into the united states . the border patrol has stepped up its efforts in the rio grande valley with more lights , and sensors to pick up movement . a levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by border patrol vehicles to patrol the area . richard cortez , the mayor of the border town of mcallen , texas , believes hiring more border patrol agents , deepening the rio grande , and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence . cortez calls the fence `` a multibillion-dollar speed bump , '' which will slow , but not stop , illegal immigration . `` it is a false sense of security , '' he said . `` america will not be safe . america will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work .

195	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sens. hillary clinton and barack obama will duel for super tuesday votes thursday night as the democratic presidential hopefuls face off for the first time together minus former sen. john edwards . thursday 's debate is taking place at the kodak theatre in los angeles , california . the debate -- sponsored by cnn , the los angeles times and politico -- starts at 8 p.m. et thursday on cnn and cnn.com . cnn 's wolf blitzer is the moderator . the event is the first democratic debate since obama 's convincing victory saturday in south carolina . on tuesday , clinton won the florida primary , a contest her campaign said helped the senator regain momentum even though it awarded no delegates . the forum at the kodak theatre in hollywood comes hours after the obama campaign revealed it had raised $ 32 million in january from roughly 170,000 new donors . that amount will allow obama to expand his television ad buys greatly in the 20-plus states holding primaries or caucuses tuesday . watch a time-lapse construction of the debate set '' the clinton campaign would not indicate how much money it had raised in the same time period . mike gravel , the other democratic presidential candidate still in the race , was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria , including support in national polls . in a cnn/opinion research corporation poll conducted january 14-17 , gravel received less than 1 percent . edwards suspended his presidential run wednesday in new orleans , louisiana , but he did n't endorse any candidate despite what aides described as furious lobbying campaigns by obama and clinton . thursday 's debate may be slightly more restrained than last week 's brutal showdown . following her south carolina loss , clinton has largely steered clear of opportunities to take aim at obama . former president bill clinton also has avoided criticizing his wife 's rival after dominating headlines with his attacks in the days before the south carolina vote . the economy is likely to dominate thursday 's debate , as both candidates look to appeal to supporters of edwards and his brand of economic populism . clinton and obama have split victories in their parties ' early-voting states : obama has won in iowa and south carolina , and clinton has won in new hampshire , nevada , michigan and florida . but the michigan and florida contests awarded no delegates , and all major democratic presidential candidates pledged to avoid campaigning in those states following national party penalties against them for moving up their contests so early . clinton was the only major candidate to appear on the michigan ballot . obama is leading clinton in the number of pledged delegates -- those awarded based on primary or caucus votes . clinton has the edge when superdelegates are factored in . -lrb- superdelegates are party leaders and elected officials who are not obligated to support a particular candidate . they can change their decisions at any time leading up to the democratic national convention in august . -rrb- . to date , obama has won an estimated 63 national convention delegates as a result of primary or caucus votes , while clinton has earned an estimated 48 delegates . clinton , however , has the overall lead in delegates -- 232 to 158 -- when superdelegates are included . with solid fundraising numbers and a nod from sen. edward kennedy of massachusetts this week , obama will be making the claim he holds the front-runner title . but clinton -- who has led in national surveys for much of the race -- will be making her case as well . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's rebecca sinderbrand contributed to this report .

204	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it may take a lot of frequent-flier miles , a penchant for cold places , a tolerance of taxes and regular doses of chocolate , but happiness could be within reach . however , it 's not where most people might expect . journalist eric weiner says he wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness . just ask eric weiner , who made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe , uncovering lots of surprises along the way . hungering for a tropical paradise ? a warm climate does n't necessarily make a happy nation , weiner said . thinking of moving to a wealthy state ? money can degrade happiness , he found . weiner , who wrote the book , `` the geography of bliss : one grump 's search for the happiest places in the world , '' began his quest for very personal reasons . `` i 'm an unhappy person , so it 's kind of what prompts a hungry person to search for food , '' he said . weiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for national public radio , a job that took him to some of the least happy places in the world . it was enough to send him on a yearlong journey to look for just the opposite . weiner mapped out his quest with a combination of scientific and personal methods , choosing some countries because they traditionally score high on happiness surveys and selecting others to see how factors like money play a role . a world map of happiness , based on 100 different studies and produced by britain 's university of leicester in 2006 , listed denmark as the world 's happiest nation . but for weiner , the place where he felt the most bliss was a toss-up between bhutan and iceland , countries that ranked eighth and fourth , respectively , on the happiness map . weiner 's list of favorites also included thailand , india and switzerland . see photos of his favorites and listen to him explain why they 're happy '' his top two picks , though very different countries , have unconventional paths to happiness , he said . `` bhutan is probably the closest thing on earth to shangri-la , that fictional paradise , '' weiner explained . he pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product , the himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of `` gross national happiness . '' `` the bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision , '' weiner said . cold place , warm relationships . thousands of miles away , weiner found happiness in a very different environment , marveling at the creativity and `` coziness '' of iceland . `` everyone in iceland is a poet , '' weiner recalled . he visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the cold and the darkness . such a chilly climate usually encourages warm relationships , weiner found . `` the cold inspires people to cooperate , traditionally . if you go back a few hundred years , people in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together . it 's that simple , '' he said . weiner found a different flavor of happiness in switzerland , where he discovered people are content partly because everything runs like clockwork . simple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness , he said . but there may be a much sweeter reason why switzerland is a happy place . `` the swiss eat a lot of chocolate , and let 's not forget that , '' weiner said . he was also impressed with how the swiss view money . `` their attitude is that if you 've got it , hide it . while our attitude is if you 've got it , flaunt it , '' weiner said , comparing the swiss to americans . weiner called the united states , which came in at no. 23 on the university of leicester 's world map of happiness , a nation that `` is not as happy as it is wealthy . '' the impact of wealth and taxes . the relationship between money and happiness took weiner to the middle east and qatar , a country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world , thanks to oil and natural gas revenues , according to the cia world factbook . `` i went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery , '' weiner said . he found the wealth made the residents comfortable , but also degraded their level of contentment . `` most of our happiness is derived from our relationships with other people , '' weiner said . `` the money in qatar has allowed them to wall themselves off , literally and figuratively , from other people . ... that 's not a recipe for happiness . '' there are no income taxes in qatar , but that 's not a cause for contentment , weiner found . some taxation is necessary for happiness because it 's a way of being invested in a place , he argued . `` you 're giving money to someone else , a government , and you 're trusting them to do something good with it , '' weiner said . `` in a country where there 's no taxation at all , people do n't have vested interests in how well the government performs . you ca n't say , ` hey , those are my tax dollars at work . ' '' quest creates buzz . weiner 's book has struck a chord , recently rising to the top 10 of the new york times nonfiction best-seller list . an expert who studies happiness said part of the book 's appeal may lie in how weiner mapped out his journey . `` he arranges an interesting itinerary because he uses science as his compass , '' said daniel gilbert , a psychology professor at harvard university and the author of `` stumbling on happiness . '' gilbert said it 's only recently that a combination of biology , sociology and psychology has been able to answer the `` where 's and why 's '' of happiness , a subject that has always fascinated people . `` the quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings , '' gilbert said . he echoed weiner 's findings that bliss is other people . `` everyone has been telling us for the longest time that happiness is about social relationships , well , bingo , they 're right , '' gilbert said . meanwhile , after a year of exploring some of the world 's happiest places , weiner -- the self-described `` grump '' -- said his mind-set has improved somewhat . `` i would describe myself as a recovering grump , '' weiner said . `` at this point , i think i am marginally happier than before i started the project .

'' `` the secretary general urges all lebanese to exercise utmost calm and restraint at this very critical time and to allow judicial procedures to take their course , '' the spokesperson said . bush 's statement added : `` the united states opposes any attempts to intimidate the lebanese people as they seek to exercise their democratic right to select a president without foreign interference . we will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the lebanese people as they resist attempts by the syrian and iranian regimes and their allies to destabilize lebanon and undermine its sovereignty . '' the u.s. embassy in beirut issued a statement saying : `` it is not a coincidence that these attacks target those figures who have been working to secure lebanon 's independence from renewed syrian hegemony . we note with concern that many lebanese politicians allied with syria have in fact warned that murder and violence would be the results of any effort to exercise genuine parliamentary democracy . '' and u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , in a written statement , said : `` the bombing that claimed these lives was another act in a campaign of terror by those who want to turn back the clock on lebanon 's hard-won democratic gains .

'' i read `` namesake '' while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me -lsb- mira 's mother in law -rsb- . it was at that state of mourning that i picked up this novel , and in it jhumpa writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country , and i thought i had been understood by someone . it was also a story that linked the two cities in which i had grown up -- calcutta and new york city -- and it was almost certainly the road that i had traveled . it just spoke to me and i felt compelled to do this film . a few months later we were shooting it . cnn : it 's filmed in both india and new york , such different cultures . tell us about the universal themes involved during the film . nair : well , the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills . it 's a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another , and tried to find out who we are through these places . then when we have children , life gets more interesting . it is about growing up through our adult lives and our children 's lives . it is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who do n't send roses and diamonds for love ; who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other . it 's about that generation of parents who have that stillness about one another , versus the clang and hustle of young gogol who is 15 and grows up in an american world because he wishes to be american . that flow -- that see-saw between parents and children , that 's what `` the namesake '' is about . cnn : tell us about casting the role of gogol . nair : well , kal penn plays gogol and he 's known as a comic star , but i had no idea that he existed until my 15-year-old son said , `` this has to be your gogol . '' i did n't take him seriously at all until every night the campaign mounted at home : `` tell me in the morning it 's kal penn !

212	hollywood , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a man serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore has confessed to overpowering and fatally shooting a deputy who was taking him to court wednesday , authorities said . michael mazza , 40 , was arrested outside a pawn shop in hollywood , florida , hours after the death of broward county deputy paul rein sparked a massive manhunt . it was the third shooting of a broward county sheriff 's deputy in four months , and the second fatality . the incident happened as mazza was being taken to the second day of his trial in connection with the armed robbery of a coral springs bank , sheriff al lamberti said . mazza was being transported in a medical van because of a medical condition , lamberti said . the driver 's compartment of the van was separated from the back by a cage or grill . mazza and rein left about 8:05 a.m. , lamberti said . minutes later , a truck driver who saw all or part of the altercation near pompano beach called 911 . `` all of this transpired within six minutes . that 's all it took , '' lamberti said . the struggle began when rein apparently pulled the medical transport van over at an intersection . the deputy 's body showed other injuries from the fight -- a broken finger , bruises and cuts , lamberti said . mazza allegedly took rein 's service weapon away from him and shot him , authorities said . although two shots were fired , rein was shot only once , the bullet entering his upper chest and exiting his lower back , lamberti told reporters . after the shooting , mazza is believed to have thrown rein from the van and driven away . a city public works employee later spotted the blood-spattered van in fort lauderdale , lamberti said . mazza , meanwhile , is believed to have hitchhiked his way down to hollywood , about 20 miles away . he approached a man at a pawn shop and asked for a ride . the man , who was headed to a second pawn shop , agreed . when the man arrived at the second pawn shop , he left mazza in the car and went inside , lamberti said . as he was talking to the clerk , a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputy 's shooting , and showed a picture of mazza , he said . the man `` tells the clerk , ` hey , i have that guy in my car , ' '' lamberti said . he went back to the car , took his keys , came back and told the clerk to call police . mazza was arrested shortly afterward . rein 's gun was found with mazza in the man 's car , the sheriff said . mazza faces charges including first-degree murder and escape , lamberti said . he was being interviewed by police wednesday afternoon and was to appear before a judge at some point , he said , and afterward would be transported to dade county jail . because the shooting was `` an emotionally charged event for all of us ... we feel it 's probably better that he be housed at another facility outside of broward county , '' lamberti said , and dade county agreed to house him . mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities , but later agreed , and confessed to shooting rein , the sheriff said . he offered no details . lamberti said mazza was serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore in coconut creek , correcting his earlier statement that mazza was serving two life sentences . he was on trial for robbery of the coral springs bank . broward county also has a pending case against mazza -- a february drugstore robbery in pompano beach , he said . mazza was dressed in civilian clothes -- a suit -- rather than jail scrubs wednesday because he had a court date , authorities have said . when caught , however , mazza was wearing a t-shirt , shorts and sneakers , lamberti told reporters . police are investigating whether he had planned the escape in advance and whether anyone helped him . rein 's co-workers told reporters he was `` in outstanding condition physically . '' the sheriff 's office has fitness-for-duty standards that deputies must meet . broward county deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates , lamberti said . thin staffing and scant resources prevent more than one deputy being involved , he said . `` it 's a routine thing , '' lamberti said . `` but it shows , in this profession , nothing is routine , whether it be a domestic , a traffic stop or just transporting an inmate to court . '' as news of the escape broke , all 273 schools in broward county went on lockdown , according to nadine drew , a spokeswoman for the school system . lamberti said rein 's wife spoke to her husband by cell phone just 10 minutes before he was shot . `` she said you never think it 's going to happen to you , '' the sheriff said . the deputy was memorialized wednesday on the web site of the broward county sheriff 's office . visitors to the site were greeted by a photo of rein , with a caption saying , `` husband . father . friend .

214	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a saudi arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gang-raped -- and then sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case . human rights groups want saudi arabia 's king abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim . the attorney , abdulrahman al-lahim , had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the saudi-controlled media about the case , al-lahim told cnn . the judge more than doubled the sentence against al-lahim 's 19-year-old client because she spoke to the media about the case , a court source told arab news , an english-language middle eastern daily newspaper . the woman -- who was initially sentenced in october 2006 to 90 lashes -- had her sentenced increased to 200 lashes and was ordered to serve six months in prison under saudi arabia 's strict islamic law . `` we were shocked , '' al-lahim said of the increased sentence . cnn has been unable to reach saudi government officials for comment on this report , despite repeated requests . watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim '' al-lahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty , but instead the court agreed to increase their jail sentences , which had been two to three years , to two to nine years , al-lahim said . the case has sparked outrage among human rights groups . `` barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself , '' said fawzeyah al-oyouni , founding member of the newly formed saudi association for the defense of women 's rights . `` this is not just about the girl , it 's about every woman in saudi arabia , '' she said . `` we 're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every saudi woman out there . we 're afraid of going out in the streets . '' human rights watch said it has called on saudi arabia 's king abdullah `` to immediely void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer . '' the woman , who is married , and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago , the lawyer said . the male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison , al-lahim said . the man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him , according to al-lahim . citing phone records from the police investigation , al-lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client . he noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position . al-lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day . it is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under saudi 's islamic law . al-lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of justice next month , where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment , according to human rights watch . he told cnn he has appealed to the ministry of justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with justice minister abdullah bin muhammad bin ibrahim al al-sheikh . `` currently she does n't have a lawyer , and i feel they 're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights , '' he said . `` we will not accept this judgment and i 'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place . '' he said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the saudi king earlier this month . `` the ministry of justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because i consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that king abdullah bin abdulaziz started and against saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions , '' he said . saudi arabia 's islamic law or sharia is not written and , therefore , subject to a wide array of interpretations . human rights watch points out that a judge in jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the ismaili faith , a branch of shia islam . under saudi law , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery . women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man , and they are not allowed to vote . the saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom , including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases , adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women 's rights and creation of a human rights commission . christoph wilcke of human rights watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case , which he said may be indicative of `` many injustices that we still do n't know about . '' `` it 's not only one court , it is the saudi government that is fully behind punishing a woman who 's been raped -lsb- and -rsb- punishing the lawyer who 's trying to help her and doing that both because they 've spoken to the media , '' wilcke told cnn . `` and if they had n't spoken to the media , we would n't know about it . '' shying away from criticism of key ally , state department spokesman sean mccormack called the case and the punishment `` surprising '' and `` astonishing . '' `` while this is a judicial procedure -- part of a judicial procedure -- overseas in courts outside of our country , still while it is very difficult to offer any detailed comment about this situation , i think most people would be quite astonished by the situation , '' mccormack said . `` i ca n't get involved in specific court cases in saudi arabia dealing with its own citizens . but most people here would be quite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out , '' he said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's saad abedine and mohammed jamjoom contributed to this report .
215	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- jordan 's king hussein sent a secret message to president richard nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack syria , according to declassified documents released wednesday by the former president 's library . president nixon works at his desk in the oval office in a june 1972 photograph . the papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the nixon presidential library , some of which offer harbingers of present-day events , such as concerns about terrorism and saudi arabia . library director timothy naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the saudis more involved in solving the palestinian-israeli conflict , how to get them more engaged against terrorism , how to address the arab view that the united states always sides with israel and how to build up moderate palestinians to counter extremists . a 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective : `` isolate and undermine terrorisms -lsb- sic -rsb- and commandos -lsb- sic -rsb- by establishing another , more stable and respectable palestinian political entity and political personality . '' documents detail u.s. efforts to persuade saudi arabia to move away from fatah , the military wing of the palestine liberation organization , because u.s. officials believed the plo was supporting the terrorist-linked , anti-israel group black september , referred to as bso . the document , a u.s. state department telegram from the embassy in jeddah to washington reads , `` bso and fatah -lsb- are -rsb- now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty . one might wonder whether central objective bso conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward middle east peace . '' the document release was intended to coincide with mideast peace summit among palestinian , israeli and other mideast leaders in maryland , naftali said . the nixon white house also was adjusting to israel 's acquisition of a nuclear weapon . `` we are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for richard nixon 's decision in 1969 to accept the fact , a fact of life , that israel had a bomb , a nuclear device , '' said naftali . `` that , of course , is very important with what 's going on in annapolis . '' `` even though it is clear from the documents that the united states government did not encourage israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent , it became a fact of life , '' naftali said . `` there are materials here that show how our government , 30 years ago , dealt with this very , very difficult problem . '' rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power , israel still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability . in 1970 , as king hussein dealt with threats by both palestinian refugees in his country and syrian military forces crossing jordan 's border , the king asked `` the united states and great britain to intervene in the war in jordan , asking the united states , in fact , to attack syria , '' naftali said . `` syria had invaded jordan and the jordanian king , facing what he felt was a military rout , said please help us in any way possible . '' the telegram indicates that hussein himself called a u.s. official at 3 a.m. to ask for american or british help . `` situation deteriorating dangerously following syrian massive invasion ... , '' the document said . `` i request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence of jordan . immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative . '' the library has withheld the nixon documents from public access until wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified , naftali said . nixon served as president from january 20 , 1969 , to august 9 , 1974 , when he resigned under political pressure during the watergate scandal -- the only u.s. president to do so . he died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81 . e-mail to a friend .
216	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the cia asked the justice department to investigate whether former operative john kiriakou illegally disclosed classified information when he talked about the waterboarding of a terrorism suspect , government officials say . ex-cia agent john kiriakou says he underwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds . kiriakou spoke last week with several news organizations , including cnn , after the cia disclosed that videotapes of certain interrogations were destroyed in 2005 . that revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on capitol hill . the bush administration appeared in u.s. district court on friday to answer a judge 's questions about the tapes ' destruction . speaking to cnn last week , kiriakou said that u.s. interrogators drew valuable information from al qaeda captive abu zubayda by `` waterboarding '' him . but kiriakou said the procedure amounts to torture and should be stopped . waterboarding involves pouring a stream of water onto the cellophane-covered face of a suspect to induce the sensation of drowning , kiriakou said . watch how a suspect is waterboarded '' kiriakou told cnn he was unaware that cia interrogations were being taped , but that the tapes should have been kept `` as a matter of historical record . '' kiriakou 's attorney mark zaid told cnn that the referral of the case to the justice department is standard procedure . `` a criminal referral from the cia would be both expected and normal under the circumstances , '' zaid said in a written statement . `` it is a routine act that the cia undertakes even when they know no violation has occurred . '' zaid added that the question is whether the justice department will proceed , and that such a decision `` must be measured carefully . '' `` doing so will unlock a pandora 's box that will place a spotlight on the information in question as to the lawfulness of the alleged conduct and the activities of those involved . '' he said . `` there would also exist a challenge regarding whether mr. kiriakou was being targeted for exercising his first amendment rights . '' cia officers who leave the agency are required to sign documents promising never to divulge classified information . written comments are cleared by an agency review board before publication , and unscripted oral comments -- such as television interviews -- are referred to the justice department after the fact . about one case a week is referred to the justice department , and an investigation could take months to complete , a source in the intelligence community said . for private citizens found to be in violation of the secrecy standard , penalties can range from loss of security clearances to criminal prosecution leading to jail time . justice department spokesman dean boyd said the department has no comment on the kiriakou matter , and routinely refuses comment on whether another agency has referred a case . kiriakou said he was not present when other agents used the waterboarding technique on abu zubayda , but that he was told the al qaeda suspect lasted 30 or 35 seconds . kiriakou said he himself was subjected to the treatment during his training , and lasted about five seconds before having to stop . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's kelli arena contributed to this report .
217	san francisco , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- `` human error factors '' probably were involved in a ship crash and oil spill that killed nearly 400 birds in san francisco bay and prompted a federal criminal probe , the u.s. coast guard said monday . a worker checks oil cleanup gear near the golden gate bridge thursday in san francisco , california . the u.s. attorney in san francisco has opened a federal criminal investigation into wednesday 's crash of the mv cosco busan to determine whether the captain and crew violated federal maritime laws . although not officially detained , the captain and crew were barred by law from leaving the vessel , which is docked for repairs in oakland , the coast guard said . `` you had a competently manned ship with a pilot , all the navigation and sensors , '' said adm. thad allen , coast guard commandant . there were `` probably some human error factors , but we need to determine the facts , because there 's no reason a ship like that should have collided with the bridge . '' watch allen on the criminal probe '' the cosco busan was departing oakland for south korea when it struck a tower supporting the western suspension span of the bay bridge , cutting a 212-foot , 12-foot wide gash in the ship 's side . about 58,000 gallons of heavy-duty bunker oil poured out of the vessel as it was moored near treasure island . see where oil spilled '' the oil sickened birds and formed globules on more than 20 of the area 's beaches . it oozed along the san francisco city waterfront and out of the bay , beneath the golden gate bridge toward marin county . allen defended the coast guard against criticism of its response to the spill . some lawmakers , including one of the state 's u.s. senators , democrat barbara boxer , have criticized the coast guard 's handling of the collision and resulting spill . boxer said the coast guard initially reported that the ship 's owner had said only 140 gallons had spilled from the cosco busan . boxer and house speaker nancy pelosi of california have called for congressional hearings into the accident and resulting spill . although allen conceded some confusion in the coast guard 's communication , he said it did not reflect their response . `` response was set into play within an hour of the event itself , '' allen said monday . regarding the initial low estimate of 140 gallons of lost oil , allen said heavy fog and damage to the ship 's tanks hindered initial aerial and on-ground evaluations of how much oil had leaked from the ship . in addition to federal prosecutors , the national transportation safety board is investigating the accident , and ntsb spokeswoman debbie hersman said sunday that agency was interviewing the pilot , the ship 's crew , and other pilots who were on the water at the time of wednesday 's crash . see photos of oil coating the bay '' the crew had been on its inaugural voyage on the ship , which the current owner purchased last month , hersman said . the ntsb also intends to review the ship 's voyage data recorder , which should have recorded captain and crew conversations on the bridge and other information in the 12 hours leading up to the bridge collision , hersman said . the oil spill has sparked concern among local officials and environmentalists . as of sunday , 23 beaches in the area remained closed . angel island state park , the bay 's largest island , reopened monday , the coast guard said . gov. arnold schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency , freeing money to clean up the spill . seven miles of containment boom stretched across the bay has collected more than 12,271 gallons of oil so far , and another 4,000 gallons have evaporated , officials said . nearly 400 dead birds have been recovered from the bay , while another 500 birds have been rescued alive but soaked in oil , according to lisa curtis , administrator of the department of fish and games office of spill prevention and response . in 1989 , the oil tanker exxon valdez ran aground and fouled alaska 's prince william sound with almost 11 million gallons of crude -- the nation 's worst ever oil spill . thousands of birds and animals died in the disaster , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . often birds and animals are threatened when they come in contact with the oil and swallow it as they try to clean themselves , said the noaa web site . in addition to birds , oil spills can be very harmful to fish and shellfish , noaa said . twenty wildlife teams were scheduled monday to be the bay , working to find sick birds so they can be rehabilitated , curtis said . on sunday , the state 's other u.s. senator and a leading coast guard official decried the accident . `` this an incident which , in my view , should not have happened , '' sen. dianne feinstein , d-california , said sunday after being briefed by coast guard officials . rear adm. craig e. bone , the coast guard 's director of inspection and compliance , echoed feinstein 's comments . `` this incident should have never ever occurred , '' he said . `` there 's systems , there 's capabilities , there 's licensed operators , there 's a pilot on board the vessel , there 's the capacity and the capability to safely navigate through this port and waterways every day . '' he added , `` but we have to move beyond the incident and the fact that it occurred and move forward into the response .

'' jackson , 26 , died eight days later . witnesses said jackson 's grandfather , who was active in the voting rights movement , had been beaten by troopers , and jackson was trying to get him to the hospital . the anger resulting from jackson 's death led civil rights leaders , including the rev. martin luther king jr. , to organize the selma-to-montgomery , alabama , voting rights march . the first attempt at that march was broken up by club-wielding state troopers and sheriff 's deputies , a melee that became known as `` bloody sunday .

'' a goodwill ambassador for the u.n. high commissioner for refugees , jolie wants to find ways to help the agency be more active inside war-torn iraq . watch cnn 's exclusive interview with jolie '' sunni-shiite sectarian violence in the country has sparked a displacement crisis that is considered the most significant in the middle east since the 1948 creation of israel . more than 4.2 million iraqis have fled their homes , around 2 million to neighboring states , mostly syria and jordan , and another 2.2 million displaced inside iraq . the flight was aggravated by the february 2006 bombing of a shiite shrine in samarra , an attack that stoked pitched sectarian warfare . many of the internally displaced live precarious lives amid conditions of squalor , crowded into camps and slums that often lack basic necessities , such as proper food , health care and shelter . `` how iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire middle east , '' said jolie . `` it 's in our best interest to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale because displacement can lead to a lot of instability and aggression . '' read transcript of interview . jolie has been working to help draw attention to the problem and has called for governments to bolster their support of the u.n.h.c.r. . in august , jolie first visited iraq and syria to get a sense of the problem . she heard stories from refugees about their plight . watch as jolie lunches with troops '' this visit to iraq is focusing on the problems of the internally displaced , 58 percent of whom are under age 12 . a top issue for the agency is getting better security . jolie is talking with u.s. officials , including top u.s. gen. david petraeus , about that issue , and are willing to provide such security which she said `` needs to be addressed and solved . '' the iraqi government needs to empower agencies that deal with migration to address the concerns of the displaced -- but that has not happened yet , she said . jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from syria and jordan and find that their homes are `` occupied '' by others or `` bombed out . '' she emphasizes the way in which these people are resettled will have `` broad implications '' in the region . jolie also is talking to people about moving forward the u.s. effort to resettle iraqi refugees in the united states , which has set a goal of taking in 12,000 of those people by september . only 375 have been admitted so far . `` i have to believe there are people working toward that goal , '' she said . international agencies , such as the united nations and the arab league , and many countries in the region and in europe are addressing the refugee and the internally displaced persons ' crisis , and money is being allocated to iraq and host countries to help clothe , feed and house people . most of the refugees are in syria and jordan , and they reside in big cities like damascus and amman . the u.n.c.h.r. is trying to help governments in syria and jordan to cope with the influx , which has stretched the resources of institutions like schools and health systems . it is also attempting to help 41,000 non-iraqi refugees in iraq , such as palestinians and iranians . last month , the unhcr announced a plan to seek $ 261 million this year for its work to help these refugees . it has almost 350 staffers `` directly engaged in operations for iraq and the surrounding region .

222	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a six-month trial was launched this week that promises to transform the way luggage is tracked and monitored at london 's heathrow airport . as many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage . the trial -- run by baa and airline emirates -- is using rfid -lrb- radio-frequency identification -rrb- technology to tag baggage . this will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport . the crucial difference between rfid and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy . barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned . if not scanned , details must be entered manually into the system , adding time and error to the process . baa estimates that heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through . rfid is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy . the # 150,000 trial -- the first of its kind in the uk -- will continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with emirates to and from dubai , and transferring through heathrow . a duplicate of the heathrow system has been installed at dubai airport . during the check-in process at heathrow terminal 3 , staff apply tags containing rfid chips to bags with information including the passenger 's name and route . the chips are then read on entry into the baggage system ; they are tracked as they move throughout ; and finally on leaving the system . as a result , says shaun cowlam , logistics director at heathrow airport , staff can know where a bag is at `` every moment of every day '' . baa is also considering introducing a sms text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are . when passengers arrive at heathrow , says cowlam , the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at . ultimately , the use of rfid could extend services to frequent flyers , and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in , and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery . the main benefits , however , will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as heathrow and dubai , as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights . emirates and baa are sharing the costs of the trial . but as vic sheppard , emirates vice president for uk and ireland says , `` cost is not an issue '' , especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags . and as cowlam adds : `` if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly . '' hong kong international airport was one of the first to deploy rfid technology in 2005 . but as outlined in a recent survey by sita , rfid is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed . `` for this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology , '' says cowlam . that widespread adoption may not be far off . the sita survey indicated that rfid tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009 . it 's still early days , but baa and emirates are optimistic for rfid 's future in airports . `` there have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years . but in the last few decades there has n't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling , '' says sheppard . `` this is a major step forward .

223	beirut , lebanon -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- supporters and opponents of lebanon 's pro-western government appeared to split seats on sunday as lebanese voters went to the polls to replace two ruling-party lawmakers assassinated in recent months . lebanese women wait in line to cast their votes in beirut . voters in beirut sent pro-government candidate mohammed al-amin itani to parliament to replace walid eido , who was killed in a june bombing . both eido , a sunni muslim , and itani are members of the bloc led by saad hariri -- the son of former prime minister rafik hariri , whose 2005 killing triggered lebanon 's current wave of political upheaval . but in metn , a maronite christian suburb east of the capital , anti-government candidate camille khouri upset former president amin gemayel by a few hundred votes , lebanese television network lbc reported . khouri is a member of the free patriotic movement , the anti-government party led by former lebanese army gen. michel aoun . aoun has said he will run for president of lebanon -- and since the post is chosen by members of parliament , sunday 's results were closely watched . gemayel was seeking the seat held by his son pierre , who served as industry minister in the government of prime minister fouad siniora before being gunned down in his car in november 2006 . he served as president from 1982 to 1988 , during the civil war in lebanon . his brother , bashir gemayel , was elected president in 1982 but was assassinated before he could take office . eido and gemayel were among several lebanese political figures killed since the february 2005 killing of the elder hariri . all were critical of syria 's influence in lebanon , and their supporters blamed damascus for their deaths -- allegations the syrians and their allies in lebanon denied . hariri 's killing triggered a wave of protests against syria known as the `` cedar revolution , '' which brought siniora 's government to power and forced syria to withdraw the garrison it kept in lebanon for three decades . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's nada husseini contributed to this report .

225	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- city officials in new york have denied iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's request to visit the site of the destroyed world trade center next week , a police spokesman said wednesday . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero , but new york city officials said no . the controversial , outspoken president wanted to `` pay his respects '' and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al qaeda attacks during his visit to the u.n. general assembly , police commissioner raymond kelly said , citing iranian officials . but workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site , `` and it would not be possible for him to go where other people do n't go , '' kelly told cnn . iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero , police spokesman paul browne told cnn . but , he said , `` if there were a further request , we 'd reject it '' because of security fears . watch why new york said no to iranian leader '' the iranian mission to the u.n. said it had not been told of the decision , but in a statement issued wednesday evening , it called the rejection `` unfortunate . '' iran is ruled by a shiite muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist sunni al qaeda . ahmadinejad 's predecessor at the time of the september 11 attacks , mohammed khatami , condemned them , and tehran cooperated with the u.s.-led campaign to topple al qaeda 's taliban allies in afghanistan that followed . the united states and iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after iranian militants stormed the united states embassy in tehran and held americans hostage for 444 days . the united states considers iran a state sponsor of terrorism and has accused the country of meddling in iraq and in afghanistan where u.s. troops are battling taliban and al qaeda remnants more than six years after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks . more than 2,700 people died in the attack on the world trade center , when al qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers . a third jet hit the pentagon , and a fourth crashed in a pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers . `` it is appalling that president ahmadinejad , one of the world 's leading sponsors of terror , would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground , '' state department spokesman tom casey said . several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit . hillary clinton , the new york senator and democratic front-runner , called the request `` unacceptable . '' former massachusetts gov. mitt romney , a leading republican , called it `` shockingly audacious . '' and former mayor rudy giuliani -- whose leadership after the attacks is the cornerstone of his gop presidential bid -- said that `` under no circumstances '' should ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the world trade center site . zalmay khalilzad , the u.s. ambassador to the united nations , said the site should not be `` used as a photo op . '' numerous critics have attacked ahmadinejad 's hard-line anti-israel stance and his insistence that iran will defy u.n. demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium . iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants , but washington accuses tehran of trying to produce a nuclear bomb . e-mail to a friend . cnn correspondent deborah feyerick contributed to this report .
226	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a florida judge friday handed a legal victory to a former astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival , ruling evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial . lisa nowak , accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival , is set to go on trial in april . ninth judicial circuit judge marc lubet ruled that all were unlawfully obtained . he said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors , most concerning police tactics in their interview of lisa nowak and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car . `` in each and every case , this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored , '' lubet wrote in his opinion . `` unfortunately , in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands . '' nowak , 44 , is accused of stalking air force capt. colleen shipman and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at orlando international airport in florida on february 5 . she pleaded not guilty march 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm , battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon . her trial is set for april . if convicted , she would face a sentence of up to life in prison . her defense attorneys had claimed nowak 's comments to police and her consent to search her car were made under duress . during a hearing held in august , lubet heard testimony from , among others , nowak , shipman and orlando police detective william becton , who interviewed nowak after her arrest . lubet said in his ruling that when nowak asked becton if she needed an attorney during the interview , he failed to answer her question in a `` simple and straightforward manner . '' `` there was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as ` formalities ' '' during the interview , lubet wrote . on the audiotape of the interview , there was no audible response from nowak on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court , and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police , lubet wrote . `` thus , there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them . '' nowak testified at the august hearing she did not respond to becton 's questions because she was confused , lubet wrote . in addition , he said , becton used `` legally impermissible '' statements and techniques , including threats , to get nowak 's statements and consent . `` well , what you say can change what you 're charged with , '' becton said at one point . `` right now we 're looking at -lsb- a -rsb- possible life felony of carjacking . '' in a written statement , an orlando police department spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court , and referred questions to prosecutors . lubet noted that , although nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat , she was `` subjected to a barrage of questions '' beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call . `` defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours , '' the judge said . nowak 's consent to search her car , lubet wrote , `` followed illegal police activity , such as a prolonged detention , threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent . '' prosecutors accuse nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from houston to orlando -- wearing nasa diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot . her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers . shipman told police that after she got into her car , nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window . when shipman cracked it to talk to her , nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray , shipman said . police said nowak was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin . nowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to shipman , who had begun dating nowak 's former love interest , navy cmdr. bill oefelein , who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps . at the august hearing , becton testified that when he searched nowak 's car , he found maps showing how to reach the airport , maps of the airport 's layout , a buck knife and papers including a letter nowak appeared to have written to oefelein 's mother . he also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car . police previously said they also found a bb gun , a steel mallet , a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle . nowak 's attorneys in august filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense , saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders . on august 30 , lubet granted nowak 's attorneys ' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's cristy lenz contributed to this report .

'' khan 's attorneys claim he was taken into custody in 2003 and `` forcibly disappeared '' before his transfer to guantanamo , `` where he remains imprisoned without charge or trial . '' he filed a legal challenge to his detention in september 2006 and appeared before a combatant status review tribunal in april , the court documents said . he was found to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant , but filed a challenge to that on august 14 . he was not allowed to meet with an attorney , however , until october , the document said . the bush administration contends khan was an operative working for khalid sheikh mohammed , mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . khan researched how to blow up gas stations and poison reservoirs in the united states , the administration has said . he is among 14 `` high-value '' detainees held at guantanamo . gutierrez and another ccr attorney , wells dixon , also released declassified notes of their meetings with khan , saying he has been on hunger strikes while in guantanamo , is `` painfully thin and pale '' and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder . in detention , he has been able to communicate with abu zubayda , an alleged lieutenant for osama bin laden , they said in the notes . a government official with knowledge of the destroyed cia tapes has said that zubayda was one of the two al qaeda suspects whose interrogations were videotaped . while undergoing interrogation and torture by the cia , `` khan admitted anything his interrogators demanded of him , regardless of the truth , in order to end his suffering , '' the documents said . without a court order requiring the preservation of evidence , `` there is substantial risk that the torture evidence will disappear '' and that may affect the challenge to his detention , the attorneys claim . the motion was filed in the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . hayden has said the cia stopped videotaping in 2002 , while khan was not taken into custody until the following year . `` the careful , professional and lawful questioning of hardened terrorists has produced thousands of intelligence reports , revealed exceptionally valuable insights on al qaeda 's operations and organization , foiled terrorist plots and saved innocent lives , '' gimigliano said . `` the information developed by the detention and interrogation program has been irreplaceable , and the program has operated in strict accord with american law .

'' two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even . map : national and state polling . `` one reason the race appears to be tight is that texas democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options , '' says cnn polling director keating holland . `` likely democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination , and they do n't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues . `` roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly , those people are splitting roughly equally between clinton and obama . '' many political strategists and analysts consider texas and ohio -- which also holds a march 4 primary -- must-win states for clinton . obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates , 193 of which are at stake in texas . the new survey indicates arizona sen. john mccain is the clear favorite for the republican presidential nomination . among republicans , 55 percent of likely texas gop primary voters support mccain as their choice for nominee . thirty-two percent back former arkansas gov. mike huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former libertarian standard-bearer ron paul . the poll 's sampling error for republican respondents is 4 percentage points . the cnn/opinion research corp. poll was conducted by telephone from friday through sunday . pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in texas , including 553 likely republican primary voters and 529 likely democratic primary voters . mccain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity . the poll was released on the same day the only living former republican president -- george herbert walker bush , the current president 's father -- endorsed mccain at an event in houston . watch mccain get a big boost '' but mccain has had trouble winning conservative voters . just last week , mccain lost the conservative vote to huckabee in the virginia primary , according to exit polls . the new survey , though , suggests mccain may have better luck in texas . `` it looks like mccain has made some inroads with conservative republicans , '' holland said . `` mccain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the gop primary . the mccain campaign probably wishes that number were higher , but it does mean that a mccain victory in texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents , as has happened in several states in the past few weeks . '' texas democrats and republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues , but the poll suggests they do agree on what 's the most important issue . thirty-five percent of democrats and an equal number of republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president . the second most important issue for democrats was health care , at 23 percent , followed by the war in iraq at 22 percent , illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent . nineteen percent of republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue , putting it in second place , followed by the war in iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent . sixty percent of republicans say they 'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing . that number climbs to 76 percent for democrats . likely democratic primary voters view clinton and obama on roughly equal terms . seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if clinton were the nominee ; an equal number feel the same way about obama . seventy-nine percent say it 's likely clinton can win the nomination ; 82 percent say the same about obama . the two candidates are essentially tied on immigration , iraq and the economy , but clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion . e-mail to a friend .

'' the zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear , vilma , had eaten her two offspring . the zoo said it feared vera would do the same , so it took her cub away as a precaution . since then , the cub is thriving in the care of humans , but vera seems to miss her cub , foghammar said . watch how zoo has faced criticism over polar bears . '' `` the mother is a little bit nervous , '' she said . `` she walks around and is searching for the baby , but the responsible persons for the zoo say this is normal . it will continue for three or four days . it 's a normal situation .

233	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- before dying , 2-year-old riley ann sawyers was beaten with belts , picked up by her hair , thrown across the room and held under water , according to an affidavit from the galveston county sheriff 's office . police believe 2-year-old riley ann sawyers is `` baby grace . '' the affidavit says the girl 's mother , kimberly dawn trenor , described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box that trenor and her husband , royce zeigler , later dumped into a galveston waterway . trenor told police zeigler tried to commit suicide the weekend before thanksgiving , and wrote a note that said , `` my wife is innocent of the sins that i committed . '' the body of the then-unidentified toddler was found on october 29 . a fisherman found riley 's body stuffed inside a blue storage container that washed up on an uninhabited island in galveston 's west bay . a medical examiner said the child 's skull was fractured , and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years . police dubbed the child `` baby grace . '' a police artist 's sketch of her was widely circulated in the news media and prompted a call to galveston police from riley 's grandmother in ohio , who had not seen the girl in months . on saturday , police arrested trenor and zeigler on charges of injuring a child and tampering with physical evidence , the sheriff 's department said . their bonds were set at $ 350,000 each . the affidavit , obtained by cnn , says when police interviewed trenor on november 23 , she `` gave a voluntary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement , with royce zeigler , in the physical abuse , death and disposal of the remains of her daughter , riley ann sawyers . '' trenor 's statement said on july 24 , she and zeigler both beat the child with leather belts and held her head under water in the bathtub . she said zeigler picked the girl up by her hair and also threw her across the room , slamming her head into the tile floor . after her daughter died , trenor 's statement said , she and zeigler went to a wal-mart that night and bought the sterilite container , a shovel , concrete mix , and other supplies . the statement said the box containing the child 's body was hidden in a storage shed for `` one to two months . '' then , trenor said , she and zeigler carried it to the galveston causeway and tossed it in , and she saw it drifting away . riley ann 's father , robert sawyers , on monday tearfully remembered her as a `` fun-loving girl ... with a big imagination . '' watch riley ann 's father describe the little girl '' riley was `` very active , very hyper , but also very well-behaved , '' sawyers told reporters in mentor , ohio . she would play `` with a water hose ... spraying the whole patio soaking wet until she was done with it , '' he said , as he sat behind two photographs of his daughter , a toddler with wispy blond curls . robert sawyers ' mother , sheryl sawyers , said the family was `` devastated '' to learn that police believe riley is dead . `` it 's hard to think that i 'll never see her again , '' she said , clutching a red elmo doll she had planned to give riley for christmas . maj. ray tuttoilmondo of the galveston county sheriff 's department said monday that authorities are `` fairly confident '' that the toddler whose body was found on october 29 is riley ann sawyers . dna analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification . the results will be available in two to three weeks , tuttoilmondo said . tuttoilmondo said riley is originally from mentor , ohio , a cleveland suburb , and that `` she and her mother came down to texas earlier this year . '' the toddler was last seen in texas `` three or four months ago , '' tuttoilmondo said , although he did not know by whom . tuttoilmondo said police did investigate whether child protective services had taken riley away , something the mother had reportedly alleged . of that report , tuttoilmondo said , `` what we believe is that is not what happened . '' the affidavit said trenor admitted that after the body was found , zeigler had her type up a fake letter from the ohio department of children 's services saying that riley was to be taken away . trenor left ohio in late may , after filing an allegation of domestic violence against robert sawyers and reaching a joint voluntary agreement that gave her custody of riley and gave robert sawyers visitation rights , the sawyers ' family lawyer said monday . `` she disappeared , '' laura depledge said monday at the ohio news conference with the sawyers . sheryl sawyers said monday that she saw widely distributed police sketches of `` baby grace '' and contacted galveston police in november . the girl in the police sketches strongly resembles photos of riley . `` no , i never did think it would end up like this , '' sheryl sawyers said monday , eyes welling . `` i guess knowing is better than not knowing . '' the girl 's family in ohio has been `` very helpful '' in this case , tuttoilmondo said , adding that the fbi and a galveston county police officer visited the family in ohio on sunday . depledge said riley was the product of a `` teenage pregnancy . '' trenor and robert sawyers were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy , depledge said , during which time they lived with sheryl sawyers . depledge said monday that the family , whose grief she described as `` simply overwhelming , '' wants riley 's body returned to ohio for a memorial service . `` what riley needs is to be brought home , '' she said . `` i think this family needs some closure . '' tuttoilmondo asked anyone who knew the child or her family to help detectives reconstruct the events of riley 's short life . the toddler 's case has touched even hardened police officers , he said . `` any way you look at it , we carry a piece of her with us , and we 'll always carry a little piece of her with us , '' he said monday . he held up a small , pink-and-white shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was found . `` that says it all . a little-bitty shoe .

'' the plaintiffs are asking for $ 10 million in compensatory damages and $ 10 million in punitive damages for each of the 393 victims named in the suit . earlier this year , chiquita , as part of a plea agreement , admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to autodefensas unidas de colombia , or auc . auc was named a terrorist organization by the united states in 2002 , making it a crime to give them money . the lawsuit alleges chiquita 's interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments -- it accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group . `` they conspired with the auc , aided and abetted them in a far-reaching conspiracy and plan to control every aspect of banana growing , distribution and sale , '' reiter said . the attorney said one couple refused to sell their banana farm `` for pennies '' and were killed by auc in 2001 , and other murder victims had been directed to `` sell their bananas only to chiquita . '' the families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals in their home country , he said . `` the principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists , when you put guns into the hands of terrorists , then you are legally responsible for the atrocities , the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit , '' reiter said . responding to the allegations wednesday afternoon , the company said , `` chiquita brands international categorically denies the allegations made by these attorneys . we reiterate that chiquita and its employees were victims and that the actions taken by the company were always motivated to protect the lives of our employees and their families .

'' in the march plea agreement , chiquita brands international agreed to pay a $ 25 million fine for the payments made by the company 's former banana-producing subsidiary in colombia . during a government investigation , the company admitted to making payments to auc even after outside counsel told the company those payments were illegal and should stop immediately . e-mail to a friend .

244	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- despite the obvious claims of younger rivals cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi , few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted ricardo izecson dos santos leite as the 2007 world footballer of the year . brazilian genius kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 world footballer of the year award . the prestigious ballon d'or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and kaka 's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old brazilian 's current standing in world football . when ac milan defeated liverpool in the champions league final in athens , avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in istanbul two years previously , it enabled kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft europe 's premier trophy -- a winner 's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance . kaka 's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the san siro from sao paulo for a fee of just $ 8.5 million in the summer of 2003 . unlike many a brazilian sporting genius , kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town . he was born into a comfortable middle class brasilia family , where football was not the only hope of a bright future . however , it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by sao paulo , after his family had moved there , at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old . kaka 's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and felipe scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 world cup finals , earning him a winners ' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against costa rica . a year later , and kaka was on his way to milan . within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the rossoneri lift the scudetto and the european super cup . throughout his career , kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games . yet to describe kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice . tall , elegant and blessed with astonishing skill , milan and brazil utilize kaka 's ability superbly . milan coach carlo ancelotti soon recognized kaka 's genius , changing his team 's system to a 4-4-1-1 , playing the brazilian behind a main target man . with andrea pirlo and gennaro gattuso holding the central midfield area , kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker , be it filippo inzaghi , ronaldo or alberto gilardino . and kaka does this with devastating effect , running at the opposition with pace and power , finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play . the fly in the ointment for milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season . although they have already reached the last 16 of the champions league , the club are floundering in serie a and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season 's competition unless they win the trophy . real madrid have coveted kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if milan do n't secure a place among europe 's elite . e-mail to a friend .

'' todd allen , tina allen 's son , told cnn he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video . he said his mother and stiles spent time together there . todd allen said nobody realized the child may have been abused . `` she 's what you 'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like , '' he said . he said he never witnessed stiles physically assault anyone . `` but i have seen him verbally and mentally assault many people , '' todd allen told cnn . looking back , tina allen said there were some warning signs . she said stiles hit her once but she did n't file a police report . she said she blames herself . `` how could i not know ? why could n't i have recognized something ? why are all these people going through this torture now because of me ?

265	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- during the 1960 presidential election , theodore sorensen helped then-sen . john f. kennedy draft a speech addressing kennedy 's catholicism and the separation between church and state . at the time , many questioned whether kennedy , who would go on to become the nation 's first roman catholic president , would be influenced by the catholic church . theodore sorensen helped write john f. kennedy 's 1960 speech on catholicism . speaking to cnn senior political analyst bill schneider , sorensen discussed kennedy 's famous 1960 speech and compared it to the speech on faith in politics delivered thursday by republican presidential candidate mitt romney , who would be the first mormon in the white house if he is elected . question : did kennedy 's 1960 speech win him the presidency ? sorensen : well , he obviously did n't lose it , nor did he free the country from the curse of anti-catholicism . the hate mail still poured into his office . the vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail , and , indeed , on election day . according to a university of michigan survey , more people voted against kennedy because of his religion than any other reason . nevertheless , that speech , which was nationally broadcast and frequently rebroadcast , certainly took a lot of the poison out of the anti-catholic issue and reassured all reasonable people . watch sorensen discuss why kennedy gave his speech '' q. could president kennedy have delivered the speech romney gave on thursday ? sorensen : no . mr. romney 's position on many of the issues are very different than jfk 's . jfk wanted to particularly stress that he believed in the separation between church and state . he believed that no one needed to worry about a catholic bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president , and that freedom of religion included freedom for those to go to any church or not to go to any church at all . so , romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than jfk did or would have . q. romney seemed to differ quite strongly with kennedy on the privacy of religion , did n't he ? sorensen : yes , he did . in fact , romney felt compelled for some reason to define his personal views of jesus christ . kennedy said , as you noted , his personal views of religion were totally his business and not the business of the american people . q. romney made the statement `` freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom . '' do you think kennedy would have agreed with that ? sorensen : i do n't think anyone would disagree strongly with that . there were some lines in the romney speech that echoed the kennedy speech . as an old speechwriter , i would congratulate mr. romney . it was a pretty good speech . i think he touched all the bases he wanted to touch . q. romney discussed his views of jesus christ , something that kennedy avoided . why did kennedy avoid discussing his religious views ? sorensen : because -lsb- kennedy -rsb- began the speech by saying his private religious beliefs -- his relationship with god or jesus christ or anything else -- was not a matter of public discussion . he did not think the election should be based on -- as he said , it 's not what kind of church i believe in , the question is what kind of country do i believe in . q. kennedy 's speech in 1960 is widely viewed as being successful . do you think romney 's speech is likely to be viewed as a success ? sorensen : i assume so . i do n't think mr. romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion . just as i do n't think senator -lsb- barack -rsb- obama should be denied because of his race . or that mrs. -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton should be denied the presidency because of her gender . this country is in deep , serious trouble , and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the country and the major qualities of the candidates and not on such superficial tests as religion , race , or gender . e-mail to a friend .
266	paris , france -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a major donors conference to raise funds for the palestinians has gone beyond expectations , with donors pledging $ 7.4 billion to help build a palestinian state , organizers said monday . france 's nicolas sarkoxy , left , welcomes tony blair and palestinian leader mahmoud abbas on monday . other delegations at the paris meeting are offering aid in kind , such as the international monetary fund , which said it would provide monitoring of the palestinians ' promised reforms to reassure donors that their money would be used efficiently . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad called the pledge of money a `` vote of confidence '' in the palestinians . former british prime minister tony blair said the support of donors needed to be repaid in the coming months with steps to create a lasting settlement . `` over the next few months , we have to show people our capability of making the difference on the ground , '' said blair , who co-hosted the conference in his new role as envoy for the so-called middle east quartet of the united nations , united states , european union and russia . the paris conference focuses on short-term priorities for the palestinians , and french president nicolas sarkozy said those include providing immediate support for the palestinian people -- particularly those living in gaza -- and stabilizing the palestinian economy . watch cnn 's jim bittermann explain the conference 's aims '' it follows on the heels of last month 's peace talks in the u.s. in which israeli and palestinian leaders vowed to negotiate a final-status agreement by the end of 2008 . french president nicolas sarkozy said france would donate $ 300 million , and the united states was expected to pledge more than $ 500 million . central to the palestinians ' request for aid is a three-year reform plan that the palestinians prepared for the conference . the plan , which covers 2008 to 2010 , centers on economic development and government reform . the world bank praised the plan , calling it a `` promising effort '' to link policy-making , planning and budgeting . but in a report released monday , the world bank pointed out the reforms would succeed in helping palestinians only if they were accompanied by both donor aid and israeli actions . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni spoke of taking such actions , saying israel is committed to meeting its responsibilities under the middle east road map , especially regarding the contentious issue of settlements . livni said an agreement had been reached with the european union to provide training for palestinian police . palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas said the palestinians did n't lack will or determination but resources . he promised donors that palestinians would work hard to create a modern country in control of its security . `` we are at a historic stage today , and the destiny of our region and peace depends on this , '' said abbas , who requested the conference be held . abbas earlier had requested $ 5.6 billion in aid over the next three years . sarkozy repeatedly told the conference he is a `` friend of israel , '' but he urged the israeli government to withdraw troops from the west bank , freeze settlements , reopen institutions in east jerusalem and help the isolated population of gaza . the world bank 's report detailed the challenges facing attempts to revive the palestinian economy , which has become almost totally dependent on foreign aid . the palestinian authority is the largest employer for its people , as private-sector jobs dry up . the world bank said wages for public sector employees account for almost half of the government 's expenditures . with public investment having nearly ceased , the world bank said , almost all government funds in the past two years have been used to pay salaries and cover operating costs . staffing also has gone up in the health and education sectors , the world bank said , leaving little money for pharmaceuticals , medical supplies , teaching and learning materials , and overall maintenance . the world bank said the reforms would only succeed if they include gaza , where 40 percent of the palestinian population lives . gaza has been subject to a wide-ranging crackdown since hamas took power in june ; its borders are closed , fuel imports are restricted , and there are strict limits on all imported goods . `` the continued entry of humanitarian goods has mitigated the impact of the closures on gaza 's population , but has not been sufficient to offset the collapse of the private sector there , '' the world bank report said . unemployment across the palestinian territories stands at nearly 23 percent , the world bank said , but in gaza , 33 percent of the population is out of a job . it predicted the figures would rise if the restrictions continue . a report monday from the u.n. development program spotlighted the pressures on private palestinian businesses , especially in gaza , where it said the private sector `` is on the verge of collapse with no scope for recovery '' unless israeli restrictions are lifted . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's jim bittermann contributed to this report .
267	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- i was 14 at the time . lebanon 's civil war was in full flood . one afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in beirut . a lebanese woman and her son run through west beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces . we ran from school screaming . forget the book bags , classmates , homework . just run . out of breath , my knees giving way , it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block . the memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently . after more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction , the bombings and assassinations have returned to beirut . every time i hear of a new explosion , i think of a frightened child sitting in darkness . in 1988 , i watched the last throes of lebanon 's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of lebanese , sad , frustrated and often fearful . see a timeline of lebanon 's recent history '' now i watch from another continent , but i find those same emotions resurfacing . the conspiracies , the car bombs , the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar . the actors are like shadows from a long gone past . they are grayer perhaps -- those who have avoided assassination . but the cast in lebanon 's tragedy has changed little in two decades . then , as now , a presidential election is the setting , and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set lebanon back 20 years . see bios of lebanon 's major players '' in 1988 , the president 's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate . militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building . compromise was nowhere in sight . the west had abandoned lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors . syria had its choice for president ; israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing muslim radicalism . the country was awash with weapons . in his last act as president , amin gemayel named fellow christian and army chief michel aoun as prime minister . at a stroke , he shattered the convention that a muslim hold that position . muslims refused to serve in the cabinet and the country ended up with two governments . aoun famously declared : `` i am prime minister and six ministers in one . '' aoun 's `` war of liberation '' against syria turned into defeat . then , he turned on fellow christians of the lebanese forces in the `` war of elimination . '' when that failed , the syrians drove aoun to take refuge at the french embassy . in august 1990 , i came to cnn as a world report panelist . i tried to explain lebanon 's chaos , the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians . i had seen people killed in front of me ; children orphaned in seconds , parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins . so when i was offered the opportunity to stay at cnn , i gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy . but almost as i left , the civil war was being laid to rest . the various factions had fought each other to a standstill ; arab governments , supported by the west , helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by syrian influence . peace came to lebanon , but it would be five years before i returned . in 1995 , i went back and was stunned . i kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants . i could n't believe that i could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another . no longer did identity -- christian , muslim or druze -- define where lebanese could go . people mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble , laughing at the same jokes . it was as if lebanon 's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser . downtown beirut , once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes , was rocking to lebanese pop music . the dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest european fashions and deluxe hotels . lovers had returned to beirut 's corniche , overlooking the mediterranean , for romantic strolls at sunset . but the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a `` pax syriana . '' as anti-syrian sentiment grew , so did political tensions . on valentine 's day 2005 , the corniche was once again rocked by an explosion . former prime minister rafik hariri was killed . the symbolism left me speechless . on the day of love , lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history . it had been widely expected that hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of syrian troops . suspicion fell on damascus , which vehemently denied involvement . on march 14 , martyrs ' square became a human sea of demonstrators : muslims , druze and christians alike , demanding the `` truth . '' but hariri 's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken lebanon a generation previously . even after it withdrew its troops , syria still had allies in lebanon . one was hezbollah , accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of u.s. marines in beirut more than 20 years previously . another was gen. michel aoun ; now back from exile , the same michel aoun who had defied syria in 1989 , but who now made common cause with hezbollah against his fellow christians . earlier this year i visited martyrs ' square . the spirit of the cedar revolution had evaporated . the place looked like a morgue . anti-government hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill . as i passed through , business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair . i wondered if they sensed my disappointment , my pain at watching beirut bleed again . lebanon 's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago . once again , the term of the president is approaching its end ; there is no agreement on his successor . suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day . and the questions haunts me : will the country 's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries ? e-mail to a friend . cnn 's joe sterling , david ariosto , saad abedine and tracy doueiry contributed to this report .

272	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in the days after benazir bhutto 's assassination , it will be tempting to reach two hasty conclusions : that she was pakistan 's last great hope and that her geo-politically crucial country has revealed itself to be inherently hopeless . irshad manji is a controversial muslim feminist and activist from toronto , canada . on each front , i take a different view . while far more liberal and democratic than gen. musharraf , bhutto disappointed moderate , modern pakistanis with her adherence to feudal politics . writing to me through my web site , american feminists say they are `` aching '' over the loss of `` our dear , sweet , brave benazir . '' i understand the sentiment . but `` brave '' is not the word used by pakistani women from whom i 've also heard . they 're hurting more over bhutto 's `` self-imposed '' conformity . `` she never realized her potential , '' a woman from karachi tells me . `` and not because she was killed but because when she had the chance , she did not effectively challenge the backward mindset that has now led to her demise . '' for example , during bhutto 's time in office , pakistan did n't defy the anti-female rape and adultery laws . those notorious ordinances , known as hudood , took their inspiration from tribal politics masquerading as islam . watch manji argue on cnn why bhutto 's legacy is mixed '' imagine the opportunity : bhutto could have championed a purer faith by tackling corrupt cultural practices . in so doing , she might have created allies among conservatives , who can be persuaded that although islam is god-given , culture is man-made . last year , a media campaign to strike down the hudood ordinances achieved this fine balance . but not because of her . and that , say many progressive pakistanis , amputates bhutto 's legacy . the fact that cruel laws against women can be publicly debated at all should suggest that pakistan has hope anyway . an exceptional leader can tap into it . history tells us so . there was a time when pakistan 's democratic politicians stuck it to the feudal fanatics . bhutto 's father , zulfikar ali bhutto , was once heckled by a religious fundamentalist . `` you drink alcohol ! '' shouted the critic . `` yes , '' retorted the elder bhutto , `` but i do n't drink the blood of the people ! '' his response captured the spirit of muhammad ali jinnah , pakistan 's founder . in 1947 , jinnah exuded high hopes for his people : `` you are free . you are free to go to your temples , you are free to go to your mosques , or to any other place of worship in the state of pakistan . `` you may belong to any religion or caste or creed . that has nothing to do with the business of the state . we are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens of one state ... you will find that in due course of time , hindus will cease to be hindus and muslims will cease to be muslims , not in the religious sense ... but in the political sense as citizens of the state . '' jinnah meant every word of his unconventional vision because he , himself , lived as a maverick . he adored his non-muslim wife , and his sister often appeared with him on the campaign trail . her visibility attested to islam 's embrace of women as partners of men . in the months ahead , the people of pakistan will need to recall jinnah 's vision . it may be of comfort know that they 're not alone . countless americans are now asking about their founders ' intentions , desperate to re-discover the better angels of their country after eight years of george w. bush . still , pakistan must avoid america 's enduring mistake . the united states lapsed into profound divisiveness following the assassinations of martin luther king jr. and robert f. kennedy . many would argue that today 's politics of polarization can be traced to the unresolved trauma of the king-kennedy murders . for pakistan , it 's high time to transcend both trauma and tribalism . i pray that in death , benazir bhutto will be the catalyst for a deeper democracy than she ever advocated in life . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .

274	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- claims by diana 's former butler that he knew a mysterious `` secret '' about the late princess have been trashed by the coroner in her inquest . diana 's former butler has given conflicting information at the enquiry into her death . the coroner said the information was already in the public domain and some of it was even mentioned in one of paul burrell 's own books . considered the first star witness of the inquest , burrell 's appearance tuesday was delayed after the coroner asked him to retrieve the last letter the princess gave him . monday , the ex-butler -- once described by the princess as `` her rock '' -- told the inquest the letter contained a `` secret , '' which he claimed he could not remember . after returning to london from his home in northern england tuesday , burrell said the letter was not there , but at his home in florida . he then handed the coroner a note that he said contained the supposed secret . the coroner revealed that what burrell referred to was that diana was planning to buy property to live in part of the time and that the location may have been in the united states or south africa . the coroner said the revelation is `` fairly and squarely in the public domain '' and that some of the information appeared in burrell 's book `` the way we were . '' explaining the apparent discrepancies in his testimony , burrell said he was confused by the cross-examination , which he described as `` horrid '' and `` disgraceful . '' the questioning of the former butler is expected to continue wednesday . diana and her boyfriend , dodi fayed , died in a paris tunnel in the early hours of august 31 , 1997 , along with their driver , henri paul . they had driven away from the ritz hotel in a black mercedes with paparazzi chasing behind . there has been speculation that the couple had planned a big announcement the night they died . photographers have testified they had heard rumors diana would say she was getting engaged to fayed or having a baby . watch report on claims about diana 's marriage plans '' burrell did not take the stand until tuesday afternoon . earlier in the day , the inquest heard from diana 's former lawyer , who said the princess had claimed queen elizabeth was planning to abdicate in april 1996 and allow prince charles to be king . maggie rae said at the inquest that diana also believed there was a plot to seriously injure her in an accident . rae said the claims came at a meeting with her legal team at kensington palace in which the princess also made clear her belief that the succession of the english crown should skip a generation to her son , william . the morning 's evidence also heard that britain 's top police officer had advised the queen against allowing diana to go on holiday with mohamed al fayed , the father of dodi . in a note from chief superintendent dai davies , head of the royal protection squad , that was read out to the court , it was stated that he and metropolitan police commissioner sir paul condon believed that the planned holiday was `` unwise . '' al fayed -- a successful businessman and owner of the london luxury store harrods -- was considered a controversial figure at the time . diana defied the advice and went on the trip . it was during this holiday on the tycoon 's luxury yacht in the french resort of st. tropez that she met dodi fayed . during her testimony , rae also gave an insight into the princess 's lifestyle , which she described as `` odd '' and `` lonely . '' she said she did not believe diana 's claims of a conspiracy against her . `` i remember one occasion when she told me about her weekend and she had been alone in those rather silent set of apartments . she had heated her own food in the microwave , '' rae told the court . `` i thought she lived in a very odd environment . i thought she was quite lonely .

275	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- princess diana 's relationships with two muslim men provoked an outburst from her mother , who called her daughter `` a whore '' , paul burrell , the princess 's former butler , told an inquest monday . diana once referred to her former butler paul burrell as `` my rock . '' burrell , who returned to britain from his home in florida to give evidence , was the first star witness of the london inquest , now in its fourth month . his role as confidant to diana , who died in a paris car crash on august 31 , 1997 , along with her boyfriend dodi fayed and hotel security chief henri paul , meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated . burrell , whom the late princess once called `` my rock , '' cast doubt on whether diana was ready to marry fayed . according to burrell , the princess was still `` holding a candle '' for former boyfriend and heart surgeon hasnat khan -- who she called `` her soulmate '' -- when she started dating fayed `` on the rebound . '' burrell told the inquest that diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in june 1997 with her mother , frances shand kydd , who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with muslim men . `` she called the princess a ` whore ' and she said that she was messing around with ` effing muslim men ' and she was ` disgraceful ' and said some very nasty things , '' burrell said . he agreed that , as a result of such calls diana , decided not to talk to her mother again . the inquest , which began in october and is expected to last another two or three months , aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the princess and dodi and determine their cause of death -- whether by accident or otherwise . asked earlier in the day if he believed that fayed was `` the one , '' burrell said `` no , i did not have that impression . '' he also cast doubt on claims that fayed and diana were engaged or on the cusp of engagement , saying : `` i find that difficult to believe . '' asked to explain himself , burrell said : `` because this was only a 30-day relationship and the princess had just finished a long-term relationship with someone -lrb- khan -rrb- she cared deeply about . i knew that because i was there and i saw it . '' diana 's 18-month relationship with khan ended around the same time she started seeing fayed in july 1997 . burrell said diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with khan might take place , given that khan is muslim . watch report on claims about diana 's marriage plans . '' khan had not proposed to the princess , burrell said , adding that khan was `` the man she loved more than any other . '' he said he spoke to diana about the possibility that fayed would give her a ring shortly before her death . burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand , rather than the left , as is customary with engagement rings . `` i need marriage like a bad rash , '' burrell claimed diana told him . last month at the inquest lady annabel goldsmith , a friend of diana , said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage `` like a rash on my face . '' burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring , as the fayed family has maintained . fayed family spokesman michael cole testified last week that dodi 's father , mohamed al fayed , was certain the couple had planned to marry . lawyers at the inquest asked burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the monday following the fatal car crash . there has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news , such as an engagement . but burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan . he said he had actually looked at diana 's schedule for that day and found only mundane items , and nothing to indicate she planned a special announcement . burrell also told the inquest he did not believe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's , husband was involved in diana 's death . mohamed al fayed , father of dodi and the owner of harrods department store , has long claimed that senior members of the royal family -- specifically the queen 's husband , prince philip -- ordered the pair be murdered . he also claims that diana was pregnant at the time of her death . but burrell said that he knew prince philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths . `` i can tell you that is not prince philip 's nature , '' he said . `` plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren . why would he want to harm her ? it 's not possible . '' the inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which prince philip sent to diana , with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters . but other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed , `` pa. '' burrell explained that philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks . `` prince philip does n't mix his words , '' burrell said . `` he says it as it is , but he is not a nasty man . prince philip is n't known for his diplomacy . he was fond of the princess . '' burrell worked for the british royals for 21 years and became close to diana after her separation from prince charles . he has written two books about his time with the princess . in his second book , burrell told of a letter from diana which indicated she feared for her life . the princess wrote that prince charles planned '' ` an accident ' in my car , brake failure and serious head injury . '' one of diana 's close friends , however , testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged . lucia flecha de lima said on december 18 that burrell was capable of imitating the princess 's handwriting . lawyers questioned burrell about the date of the letter . burrell said it was written in october 1996 , two months , after diana and charles divorced -- yet the letter refers to charles as `` my husband . '' burrell responded that diana always referred to charles that way , even after the divorce . the inquest has revealed that diana was a prolific letter-writer who also received a lot of correspondence . witnesses , including burrell , recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk , with the more important ones stored in a special box . burrell testified that after diana 's death , her mother , frances shand-kidd , worked every day for a week shredding the papers from diana 's desk . he said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on december 19 , 1997 . it was at this meeting that queen elizabeth told burrell : `` there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge . '' that comment , which has been widely reported , was meant to warn him to be careful , burrell said , and was not a warning about any one person or group of people . at the same meeting burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of diana 's belongings to keep safe . the details of the conversation emerged when burrell stood trial for their alleged theft in 2002 , causing the case against him to collapse . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's emily chang and heidi berger contributed to this report .

'' but reid said democrats would continue pushing to shift federal tax breaks away from fossil-fuel producers and into renewable energy research -- one of the party 's top priorities when it took control of congress in january . house opponents such as rep. joe barton , r-texas , complained that the bill will undo many of the efforts made to foster increased production of fossil fuels in an energy bill passed in 2005 . `` i understand the consequences of elections . i understand there 's a new majority , '' said barton , the ranking republican on the house committee on energy and commerce . `` i do not understand how what made sense two years ago does n't make sense today .

'' dominguez said he used branches and sticks to spell out the word `` help '' near the culvert , where the three slept the last two nights -- at times sleeping with their feet inside each other 's shirts to help stave off frostbite . he said his daughter was the first to hear a california highway patrol helicopter overhead . he said he ran though several feet of snow barefooted to wave it down . `` when they turned around , man , i was just praising god and saying , ` thank you lord , thank you lord , ' because i knew we had made it , '' he said . police vehicles equipped with snow chains rumbled up mountain roads to help conduct the search , which also involved a snowmobile and dogs . more than 80 searchers scoured the woods wednesday until the four were found about 1 p.m. -lrb- 4 p.m. et -rrb- . officer steve ward said he was piloting the helicopter out ahead of bad weather when he spotted dominguez coming out of the culvert and waving . `` we were very lucky that we just saw this guy at the last second . '' paramedic flight officer dave white , who was with ward , said that after the two shut down the helicopter and waved the family over , all four came running . `` the little girl was in tears , '' he said . white said the family was found north of where ground crews were searching . the pilots could see the `` help '' sign they had made with twigs on a nearby four-wheel-drive road , he said . christopher dominguez told cnn 's anderson cooper the family got lost sunday searching for a tree , which they had chopped down but later abandoned . he said they did n't have food , heavy coats or other provisions to help prepare for the cold nights . `` we were n't prepared at all , '' he said . `` we just thought we were going to go up to the mountains , get our tree and go back home . it did n't turn out that way . '' after the family failed to locate their vehicle , he said , snow and darkness began to fall . at that point , lexi dominguez said , `` i started freaking out . '' `` it was really , really scary , '' she said . `` i just remember walking and walking and being like , we 're not going to make it , '' lexi said . and as they huddled for warmth , christopher dominguez said , his sister sang songs to help pass the time until help arrived . `` we were all just happy , happy to be rescued , '' christopher dominguez said late wednesday , huddled with his siblings under blankets in their home . `` i feel good , just happy to be home , '' said joshua dominguez . `` because i did n't think we were going to make it .

283	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the death of a passenger last week aboard an american airlines flight underscores the importance of taking precautions before flying , a travel health industry representative said monday . an american airlines passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week . jill drake , a marketing representative for medaire , inc. , said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17,000 in-flight medical events . flight attendants with sick passengers call good samaritan hospital in phoenix , arizona , a level-one trauma center where emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions from any of 2 million airline passengers flying at any given time , she said . `` very rarely '' does the call result in a diversion , a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passenger 's health , she said . the pilot must weigh weather conditions , remaining fuel and proximity to an airport . as of 1 p.m. -lrb- 3 p.m. et -rrb- monday , medaire had fielded 110 calls , `` which is a very busy day for us , '' she said . on average , the company gets about 50 in-flight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day , and an additional 25 or 30 calls related to events that occur at airport gates or aboard yachts and commercial ships , she said . airlines contracting with medaire include continental , southwest and british airways . american has its own in-house medical team . drake said medaire 's doctors documented 97 onboard deaths in 2007 , down from 110 in 2006 . the top categories of in-flight illness are fainting , gastrointestinal problems , respiratory issues such as shortness of breath , heart problems ranging from arrhythmias to arrest and orthopedic problems , such as broken bones , drake said . by law , u.s.-based commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators , oxygen and medical kits . some airlines choose to carry extra , non-mandated medications . if a passenger already has breathing problems , airplane travel will only worsen the condition because cabins are typically pressurized at 8,000 feet , said drake . her advice to anyone not feeling 100 percent : `` do not travel . '' and anyone with a medical condition who travels should pack any critical medications in a carry-on bag , she said . though flight attendants are trained to handle on-board emergencies , `` they are not medically trained , '' she said . `` to think that they are going to be able to assist your every need , that 's quite a high expectation . '' hydration and moderation are key , and passengers should carry water and a snack , she said . vacationers often return home from tropical locales sunburned and , in some cases , drunk . `` altitude amplifies the buzz , '' drake said . `` you have a couple of cocktails in denver , you feel it a little bit more than in omaha . '' denver 's altitude is 5,280 feet ; omaha 's is 1,040 feet . flying in a fresh cast can also prove dangerous . `` your arm could expand and it could cut off your circulation , '' she said , noting that the risk is reduced with older casts , which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling . though the faa began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago , the list was tiny . during the 1990s , overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment , and pressure increased for u.s.-based airlines to follow , said dr. russell rayman , executive director of the aerospace medical association , which has roughly 3,000 members including physicians , research scientists and flight nurses . congress held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004 . american airlines was among the first to do so , said dr. david mckenas , who served for 10 years as the airline 's corporate medical director until 2002 . he lauded the defibrillator as `` so good it 's like 100 cardiologists in a box . '' the machine will only work if the patient 's heart is fibrillating , a condition where the contractions become so irregular it loses its ability to pump blood efficiently . american airlines buys its kits from banyan international corp. , which describes itself as `` the nation 's leading provider of emergency medical kits . '' each of the nine-pound , $ 250 kits includes aspirin , alcohol swabs , nitroglycerine tablets , antihistamines , iv tubing , a stethoscope , a blood-pressure gauge , a bronchodilator , syringes , gloves , saline solution , epinephrine , dextrose , a manual resuscitation bag , alcohol pads and shears . oxygen comes in several forms aboard planes . the oxygen that flows into masks stored above individual seats is not medical oxygen and would not suffice for a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency , said rayman . flight attendants have portable bottles of oxygen that they are to use for themselves in the event of a cabin decompression . `` it could be used if there is a medical emergency on board , but that 's not its purpose , '' he said . more oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots . though medaire keeps track of its clients ' medical air incidents , rayman criticized the faa 's failure to do so . `` there is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved , '' he said . `` they do n't want to report it because it just does n't look good . it 's not good p.r. , you could say . '' he said even an anonymous registry would serve a useful purpose . `` we 're concerned for safety on the flight , '' faa spokeswoman alison duquette said . `` once someone leaves the aviation system , there is no way for us to track the outcome .

284	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the sole survivor of the crash that killed princess diana has told a court he still can not remember the incident but does not support the conspiracy theories surrounding it . bodyguard trevor rees and the back of princess diana 's head are seen shortly before the car crash . bodyguard trevor rees , formerly known as trevor rees-jones , was the front-seat passenger in the mercedes that carried diana , her boyfriend , dodi fayed , and their driver , henri paul . he sustained serious injuries in the august 31 , 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident , threatening him to keep quiet . he said the caller told him to keep quiet , saying , `` we know who you are , we know where you are , and we know where you live . '' rees said he did n't take the calls or letters seriously . a lawyer also asked rees about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her , `` if i remember , they 're going to kill me . '' rees said he did n't recall the conversation and found it unlikely he ever made the remark . rees , who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye , told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash , which , he has said , was an accident . he has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving the ritz hotel in paris , and that his next memory is more than a week later , in his hospital bed , when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead . rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw , the base of his brain , and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations , some of which al fayed paid for . rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , that british security services were behind the crash . he denied the security services paid him to change his story . at the time of the crash , rees was working for al fayed 's security team and was assigned to guard dodi fayed . he was also protecting the princess because she was fayed 's companion on the trip . he no longer works on al fayed 's security team . rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down , largely because he does into support al fayed 's conspiracy theories about the crash . `` i am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all , '' rees testified . `` all i have ever done is given the truth as i see it . '' in 2000 , rees published a book , `` the bodyguard 's story : diana , the crash , and the sole survivor , '' offering his account of the events surrounding the crash . he said al fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book 's publication in england . rees told cnn he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew , but also to counter al fayed 's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident . rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills . during the morning session , rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash , but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories . in the first , rees said , he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently diana -- calling out , `` dodi '' from the back seat of the car . in the second flashback , rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car . lawyer ian burnett then read from a letter written by al fayed to lord stevens , who investigated the crash for the british police . in the letter , al fayed says rees is lying about losing his memory . `` he knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress , '' al fayed wrote , alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot . rees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss : `` i have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel , that 's my last true memory . '' rees also said claims the couple visited a jeweler 's in monte carlo to buy an engagement ring in late august 1997 were untrue . british authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances . a judge , who is also called a coroner , holds hearings to determine how the person died , but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt . although diana and dodi fayed died in paris , a british coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to britain . the inquest does not involve driver henri paul because his body remained in france . british authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after french authorities concluded their investigation , which lasted from august 1997 to late 2003 . the inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that british police could do their own report , which was needed for the british inquest . the british police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in december 2006 . the inquest then resumed in october 2007 and is expected to last four to six months . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's teresa martini contributed to this report .

289	rawalpindi , pakistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto 's assassination was her own fault , the country 's president , pervez musharraf , said in an interview on u.s. television . bhutto sits on stage at a campaign rally minutes before her assassination . `` for standing up outside the car , i think it was she to blame alone -- nobody else . responsibility is hers , '' the former general told cbs ' `` 60 minutes '' on sunday . bhutto was killed december 27 in rawalpindi , south of the pakistani capital islamabad , while she was standing in an armored moving car after rallying supporters for now-postponed parliamentary elections . her head was above the roof and unprotected at the time of the attack . the cause of her death is not clear : a bomber blew himself up near bhutto 's limousine and videotape showed a gunman present , though no autopsy has been carried out . asked if bhutto could have been shot , musharraf said , `` yes , absolutely , yes . possibility . '' he has said he welcomes an international investigation . musharraf , who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 , rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to bhutto , who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister . he noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and `` was given more security than any other person . '' asked about the hunt for al qaeda leader osama bin laden , widely rumored to be in the remote border region between pakistan and afghanistan , musharraf said , `` there is no proof whatsoever that he 's here . we are not particularly looking for him , but we are operating against this -- and al qaeda and militant taliban . and in the process , obviously , it is combined . maybe we are looking for him also . '' and pakistan 's ambassador to the united states , mahmud ali durrani , told cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer '' that , `` if we knew where he was , we would have taken him out . '' durrani added that musharraf 's comment about `` not specifically looking for osama '' means that the pakistani military is `` totally focused on destroying al qaeda and the taliban network and not just one person . '' about bhutto 's death , he noted only that the investigation is not completed `` and we should not jump to conclusions . '' still , he added , `` if she had not come out of the vehicle , the protected and armored vehicle , maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today .

'' the new york times reported sunday that the bush administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of pakistan to shore up support for musharraf 's government and to find bin laden and his second in command , ayman al-zawahiri . democratic presidential candidate bill richardson of new mexico told cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer '' that , though he had not heard details of the plan , `` it sounds like a strategy that makes sense . '' he added , `` we have got to take whatever action is needed . '' richardson has called for musharraf to step down and has called for free and fair elections . `` what we need to do is ask musharraf , push him , push him to step aside for the good of the country , because he is widely unpopular , '' he told cnn . sen. hillary clinton , a democratic presidential candidate from new york , said saturday that she would try to persuade musharraf to share the responsibility for safeguarding his country 's nuclear weapons with a delegation from the united states and perhaps great britain . meanwhile , detectives from britain 's scotland yard on sunday once again examined the white land cruiser that bhutto was riding in when she was assassinated , pakistan 's state-run news agency said . the associated press of pakistan said the detectives also watched videos of bhutto 's last moments three times , and looked at bird 's eye view photographs of liaqat bagh park taken from a building that overlooks the rawalpindi public site . the team of five detectives arrived in pakistan friday after musharraf agreed they should work alongside pakistani agencies to determine how bhutto was killed and who was responsible for her death . on saturday , the team spent more than two hours at the park . musharraf said he expected the scotland yard investigators to help `` solve all the confusion '' surrounding the case . bhutto 's husband , asif ali zardari , wants a united nations inquiry into his late wife 's assassination . the pakistan interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car 's sunroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy . however , supporters of bhutto insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast . e-mail to a friend .

'' `` m '' is the child at the center of a long-running custody dispute between james and lia boldt , who divorced in 1999 . soon after , the father began studying judaism and later converted . he also started teaching his son about the faith . by then , james had parental custody and told his ex-wife the boy would convert as well , and that to do so , he would have to have the circumcision procedure . the mother objected , saying the child had been raised in the russian orthodox faith while the couple was married . because the two sides disagreed , and were living in neighboring states , the conflict dissolved into ongoing personal and constitutional dispute . james boldt said that as a jew and the primary caregiver , he has a first amendment right to practice his faith as he sees fit for his child . lia boldt countered her son does not want to go through with the circumcision , and that it is an invasive , irreversible , and potentially dangerous medical procedure . the state high court seemed especially reluctant to address the issue , saying normally such disputes `` are considered private family matters . '' but the justices noted `` these parties can not or will not resolve this matter without resort to the courts . '' so rather than offer a definitive ruling , the justices ordered both sides to go to the actual source of the conflict . `` in our view , at age 12 , m 's attitude regarding circumcision , though not conclusive of the custody issue presented here , is a fact necessary to the determination '' of whether the mother can press her objections to the procedure , wrote chief justice paul de muniz for the six-member panel . `` forcing m at age 12 to undergo circumcision against his will could seriously affect the relationship between m and his father , and could have a pronounced effect on father 's capability to properly care for m.

'' the cole was badly damaged by an al qaeda bombing during a port call in yemen in 2000 , killing 17 sailors . it returned to service in 2002 . the destroyer and two support ships are close to lebanon but out of visual range of the coast , pentagon officials said . another six vessels , led by the amphibious assault ship uss nassau , are close to italy and steaming toward the other three , the officials said . mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president , which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week . but he said the vote was `` important , '' and washington was waiting for it to take place . and a bush administration official told cnn the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboringsyria that `` the u.s. is concerned about the situation in lebanon , and we want to see the situation resolved . '' `` we are sending a clear message for the need for stability , '' said the official , who was not authorized to speak for publication . the ships `` should be there a while , '' the official added . lebanon 's pro-western majority in parliament and the pro-syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years . the country has been without a president since november , when pro-syrian leader emile lahoud 's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement . despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief gen. michel suleiman , disagreements over how to share power in a future cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote . parliament speaker nabih berri 's office announced tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to march 11 . berri 's office said the arab league needed more time to break the deadlock . lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri , whose supporters blamed damascus for his killing . the resulting outcry eventually drove syrian forces out of lebanon , where they had been stationed since the 1970s . e-mail to a friend . cnn correspondent zain verjee contributed to this report .

'' the clashes began when authorities used force to clear freedom square of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days , according to a u.s. embassy official . ghazarian said the authorities `` moved in '' because `` they thought that there were arms there , and it turned out that they were right . '' watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition '' the embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in freedom square grew to as many as 60,000 armenians at times over the last 10 days . as of early sunday morning , freedom square was empty , ghazarian said , but the protesters were demonstrating in a main square elsewhere in the city . watch ghazarian discuss the situation in armenia '' `` what is happening on the streets of yerevan is people protesting what they consider to be unfair elections , '' ghazarian said . `` after the president was forced to declare a state of emergency , things have quieted down . there are a couple of burning cars , and there are a few hurt people , '' she said . `` we 're convinced that this will come to an end soon . '' she did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries . witnesses told cnn that saturday morning 's action by armenian riot police was bloody , but the u.s. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries . an armenian woman interviewed by cnn said there was `` huge chaos '' when police moved in . `` these are innocent people , '' she said . `` they just want their freedom . they just want to be heard . they are being beaten up , some people have horrible wounds .

294	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- saddam hussein let the world think he had weapons of mass destruction to intimidate iran and prevent the country from attacking iraq , according to an fbi agent who interviewed the dictator after his 2003 capture . iraqi leader saddam hussein in an unknown location in iraq after his capture in 2003 . according to a cbs report , hussein claimed he did n't anticipate that the united states would invade iraq over wmd , agent george piro said on `` 60 minutes , '' scheduled for sunday broadcast . `` for him , it was critical that he was seen as still the strong , defiant saddam . he thought that -lrb- faking having the weapons -rrb- would prevent the iranians from reinvading iraq , '' said piro . during the nearly seven months piro talked to hussein , the agent hinted to the iraqi that he answered directly to president bush , cbs said in a posting on its web site . `` he told me he initially miscalculated ... president bush 's intentions . he thought the united states would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four-day aerial attack , '' piro said . `` he survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack . '' `` he did n't believe the u.s. would invade ? '' correspondent scott pelley asked . `` no , not initially , '' piro answered . once it was clear that an invasion was imminent , hussein asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks , piro said . `` and at that point , it would go into what he called the secret war , '' the agent said , referring to the insurgency . but piro said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of hussein 's plan . `` well , he would like to take credit for the insurgency , '' he said . hussein had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that , piro said . `` he wanted to pursue all of wmd ... to reconstitute his entire wmd program . '' hussein said he was proud he eluded u.s. authorities who searched for him for nine months after the u.s.-led invasion , piro said . `` what he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us , '' piro said . `` he told me he changed ... the way he traveled . he got rid of his normal vehicles . he got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with , really just to change his signature .

295	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- hispanics are described as the largest minority group in the united states , as a burgeoning force in the electorate and as an untapped frontier of the business market . yet these descriptions belie the complexity of the 44 million people to whom they refer . susana clar , with daughters vanessa -lrb- left -rrb- and virna -lrb- center -rrb- , says the labels `` hispanic '' and `` latino '' are limiting . even the terms used to name them -- hispanics , hispanic-americans , latinos , latino-americans , the spanish-surnamed -- too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions , some observers say . `` we are mixed and we are many things , '' said phillip rodriguez , a documentary filmmaker . many of his films , such as `` los angeles now '' and `` brown is the new green : george lopez and the american dream , '' explore the experience and identity of latinos in the united states . latinos `` very often do n't share language , do n't share class circumstances , do n't share education ; it 's very difficult to speak about them as one thing , '' he said . from a census standpoint , being of hispanic or latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories : mexican , puerto rican , cuban or `` other spanish , hispanic or latino '' origin . in the latter more open-ended category , respondents can write in specific origins , such as salvadoran , argentinean or dominican . according to a pew hispanic center/kaiser family foundation survey in 2002 , that is how most latinos choose to identify themselves . when asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves , 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents ' country of origin . about one quarter choose `` latino '' or `` hispanic , '' and 21 percent chose `` american . '' but the broader terms -- latino , hispanic -- are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a `` trend among latinos , '' or when a politician appeals to the `` hispanic vote . '' the u.s. government came up with the term `` hispanic '' in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to spanish-speaking countries . the term `` latino '' refers to origins from latin america , which includes non-spanish speaking countries like brazil . the terms are often used interchangeably , which is a point of some contention in the wider community . but do the terms carry meaning among the people to whom they refer , or are they merely governmental designations ? `` that 's the way you call our people , '' susana clar , 52 , said of the terms . she and her family emigrated from uruguay nearly two decades ago , and she works as a vice president in her daughter , vanessa di palma 's , salt lake city , utah-based communications firm . `` either you are latino -lsb- or -rsb- hispanic . i 'm fine with that , but i think that we are so much more than that , '' clar said . manuel baez , 49 , a native of the dominican republic who owns an insurance agency in tampa , florida , laughingly answered the question of how he identifies himself . `` manuel or manny , '' he said , adding , `` we 're being put together in this package and that 's too hard , '' he said , stressing that he did n't like labels . he continued , `` dominican-american really represents who i am , instead of dominican or latino . '' he never uses hispanic to identify himself because `` i am mixed , '' baez said . `` hispanic does n't go with me because i do n't believe that spain was the best thing for latin america . '' `` for me ... there is no such thing as a latino identity , '' said suzanne oboler , professor of puerto rican and latino studies at john jay college at the city university of new york . `` there 's certainly a cultural understanding ... -lsb- and -rsb- a political identity , '' she said , noting that the many different groups will join on particular issues such as immigration and wages . but she stressed that it was not a homogenous group . `` not all latinos speak spanish , for example . not all latinos are going to vote democratic ... all latinos are not immigrants . '' others , such as carl j. kravetz , a longtime veteran of hispanic marketing , said similarities among the different subsets of latinos do show a latino identity , one partly fused through the group 's experience in the united states . kravetz heads a los angeles-based hispanic advertising agency called cruz/kravetz : ideas . the association of hispanic advertising agencies embarked on a latino cultural identity project last year -- when kravetz was the organization 's chairman -- to better understand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional spanish-language market . there is `` very definitely a latino identity , '' kravetz said . it is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of country of origin , the group tends to `` cluster '' in a few areas , he said . those areas include interpersonal relationships -lrb- latinos tend to emphasize family ; individuality is not as important -rrb- , perceptions of time and space -lrb- they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy -rrb- , and spirituality -lrb- religion and spirituality have a strong influence on latino life and perception of the world -rrb- . david chitel , the founder of new generation latino consortium , a group of advertising and media companies , also said there are definite cultural ties among latinos , particularly between those born in the united states . so much so , he said , that he and others coined the term `` new generation latinos '' to refer to them . `` we 're talking about people that have grown up here in the u.s. in latino households , most likely with their parents speaking spanish at home , eating certain foods at home , certain values and traditions that are instilled in them , from music to religious beliefs to the importance of family , these sorts of things , '' chitel said . `` and it creates very much an identity that is latino . '' chitel said this group of u.s.-born latinos should be reached with culturally nuanced media , in the same way the african-american market functions . still , some chafe at the labels . `` every time it comes up it just kind of annoys me and makes me mad , '' anna rivas , of boulder , colorado , said of her background . her parents emigrated from mexico before she was born , but she said she 's never identified with the mexican culture . `` on a regular basis i get asked where i 'm from , '' she said . `` and i 'll usually reply , ` my parents are from mexico . ' and i do n't say , ` i 'm hispanic or latino , or i 'm from mexico , ' because i 'm not . '' e-mail to a friend .

298	myrtle beach , south carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the top three democratic presidential candidates face off in a monday night debate in south carolina , with the hearts and minds of african-american voters on the line . sen. barack obama addresses ebenezer baptist church , where the rev. martin luther king jr. once preached . sens. hillary clinton of new york and barack obama of illinois and former sen. john edwards of north carolina share the stage at myrtle beach 's palace theatre as the nation honors the rev. martin luther king jr. with a federal holiday . the debate , put together by cnn and the congressional black caucus institute , comes five days before the democratic primary in south carolina , where almost half of the democratic primary voters are african-americans . these voters will be crucial to the outcome of saturday 's primary in south carolina . they now appear to be leaning heavily toward obama , who if elected , would become the country 's first black president . having a debate on martin luther king jr. . day in south carolina `` is very fitting , '' said david bohrman , cnn senior vice president and washington bureau chief , who is executive producer of the debate . `` perhaps a debate on martin luther king day in south carolina should be made a must-stop on the road to the white house every four years . '' a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released friday suggested that nearly 60 percent of black registered democrats were backing obama as the presidential nominee , with 31 percent supporting clinton . that 's a major shift from october , when african-americans backed clinton over obama , 57 percent to 33 percent . what appears to have changed is obama 's electability . `` there 's been a huge shift among african-american democrats from clinton to obama . african-american democrats used to be reluctant to support obama because they did n't think a black man could be elected . then obama won iowa and nearly won new hampshire . now they believe , '' bill schneider , cnn 's senior political analyst , said . `` obama 's lead over clinton among black men is more than 50 points , and among black women , once a clinton stronghold , obama has an 11-point advantage , '' said keating holland , cnn 's polling director . entrance polls from saturday 's nevada democratic caucuses match what appears in the cnn poll . eighty-three percent of black voters questioned before they entered the caucuses said they were backing obama , with 14 percent supporting clinton , who if elected , would become the country 's first woman to win the presidency . these kinds of numbers could spell trouble in south carolina for clinton , who 's coming off victories in the new hampshire primary and the nevada caucuses . but clinton holds a special relationship with many in the black community , thanks to her efforts in support of civil rights and to the popularity of former president clinton with african-americans . both democratic front-runners were reaching out to african-american voters sunday . obama , who often refers to king in his speeches , spoke at atlanta , georgia 's ebenezer baptist church , where the late civil rights leader once preached . watch clinton , obama reach out to black voters '' obama recalled the legacy of discrimination against african-americans but challenged the audience at the historic black church to take a look at a few lingering prejudices among some within the community . `` and yet , if we are honest with ourselves , we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean . if we 're honest with ourselves , we 'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to king 's vision of a beloved community , '' obama said , citing homophobia , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant sentiment . obama told the congregation sunday morning that if king could forgive his jailers , `` surely we can look past what divides us in our time . '' obama 's visit to the city coincided with his endorsement sunday by the atlanta journal-constitution , which cited his `` appeal across many of the lines that have divided america , '' adding that `` both clinton and obama would make very good presidents , -lsb- but -rsb- obama is the person ; this is his time .

'' also on `` late edition , '' the house majority whip , rep. james clyburn , d-south carolina , cited the timing of the debate to help put the spotlight on issues important to blacks . clyburn , the highest ranking african-american in congress , was instrumental in having monday 's debate held in south carolina . `` when we were dealing with the dates of the primary , we tried to work in the symbolism that it would have to all of the world , for that matter , to have this debate on martin luther king jr.

302	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush on friday proposed a temporary , broad-based tax relief package aimed at spurring the nation 's slowing economy . `` we can provide a shot in the arm '' to the economy , president bush said friday at the white house . during remarks at the white house , bush , flanked by economic advisers , said the nation 's economy is at risk for a downturn and congress must act to head off trouble . `` this growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours , '' bush said . `` by passing a growth package quickly , we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy , and it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments , such as the housing market , from adversely affecting other parts of our economy . '' watch more of bush 's tax outline '' it should equal about 1 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product , or roughly $ 140 billion , he added . bush said the economy will continue to grow but at a slower rate . the president offered no specific details of the proposed package , but he did insist that it include tax incentives for business , `` including small businesses , to make major investments in their enterprises this year . '' bush also said the economic package must include `` rapid income tax relief '' for consumers to `` lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less . '' although democratic leaders in congress expressed general support for bush 's remarks , other democrats on capitol hill met the president 's proposal with suspicion . two democratic leadership aides made it clear friday that the growth package would not win support from democratic leaders unless it includes relief for low and middle income earners . `` we want to include people who pay taxes , not necessarily income taxes -- a lot of lower income people pay payroll taxes , '' said one aide . another source stated flatly , `` we 're not going to pass a bill in the house that does n't include low-income people . '' sen. charles schumer , d-new york , said he was disappointed that bush did not include stimulus-spending measures aimed at helping the disadvantaged such as extending unemployment benefits . schumer said such spending initiatives would jump-start the economy faster than tax cuts alone . `` i think if we avoid any of the ideological fights , we could actually pass something so that it would take effect on march 1 , '' schumer said . house speaker nancy pelosi , d-california , expressed agreement with bush on `` the need to provide assistance immediately , '' saying in a statement that `` we must invest our resources in such a way that injects confidence and consumer demand , promotes economic growth and creates jobs . '' senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said , `` i also agree that our focus must be on finding temporary measures that will do the job effectively . '' sen. edward kennedy , d-massachusetts , agreed that `` we must act swiftly to boost the economy '' but stressed the need to help families who `` are struggling every day to pay their bills , heat their homes and pay their mortgages . '' bush 's remarks came a day after talks on the subject with democratic and republican lawmakers , and following federal reserve chairman ben bernanke 's call for a fiscal stimulus package to help an economy beset by plummeting stock prices and a credit and mortgage crunch . bush said friday he was encouraged by his discussions with lawmakers . `` i believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support . '' existing income tax cuts supported by the bush administration are due to expire in 2010 , and the president called on congress to make them permanent . `` unless congress acts , the american people will face massive tax increases in less than three years , '' bush said . `` this tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk . '' watch experts explain how to goose the economy '' the proposed stimulus package comes as a leading gauge of future economic activity was released friday by the conference board . the december report showed a decline for a third straight month for the u.s. leading index -- down two-tenths of a percent . the report cited housing permits for the largest negative contribution to the index . see chart showing americans ' recession fears '' on thursday , the dow jones industrial average of stock prices dropped more than 300 points after reports of slowing growth and massive debt write-offs by merrill lynch . the brokerage giant reported a nearly $ 10 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 and wrote off more than $ 11 billion in bad mortgage debts . former treasury secretary lawrence summers stressed the importance of whom any relief package would target . `` it needs to go to people who are going to spend it , '' summers said friday on cnn 's `` american morning . '' `` that means particularly those who rely on tax refunds -- those receiving benefits , those whose incomes have been hurt by the downturn . '' bernanke told the house budget committee on thursday that he does not believe the economy will enter a recession , but he said he expects growth to proceed at a slow pace this year and possibly into early 2009 . he said congress needs to take decisive action to boost the economy . `` to be useful , a fiscal stimulus package should be implemented quickly and structured so that its effects on aggregate spending are felt as much as possible within the next 12 months or so , '' bernanke said . but he said any package should be `` explicitly temporary '' to avoid running up the government 's long-term debt . bernanke stopped short of suggesting that the bush tax cuts should be made permanent , telling lawmakers he supports `` the law of arithmetic . '' `` what comes in at least has to equal what goes out at some point , '' he said . in 2001 , americans received checks from the government designed to stimulate the economy . individuals received $ 300 and families $ 600 . twenty to 40 percent of the checks were spent within days . consumers saved one-third of the money , and two-thirds went back into the economy within two quarters , officials said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's deirdre walsh contributed to this report .
303	tampa , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- after witnessing the rapid devastation of a cayman island coral reef where he had been diving since childhood , todd barber was moved from horror to action . he gave up a six-figure salary as a marketing consultant and dedicated his life to restoring the world 's ocean reef ecosystems . `` i had been following this reef since i had been 14 ; it was where my first dive was , '' recalls barber . `` when that one little tiny reef was lost , that sparked something in me . if we lost one and it took that tens of thousands of years to get here , how fast is this happening ? '' barber had caught a small glimpse of a larger global issue -- the destruction of the world 's coral reefs -- and it scared him . according to the nature conservancy , if the present rate of destruction continues , 70 percent of the world 's coral reefs will be destroyed by the year 2050 . not only are they home to 25 percent of all marine fish species , but the organization states that 500 million people rely on coral reefs for their food and livelihoods . so barber and his father , a marine biologist and fellow diver , sat down to devise a solution to `` put the reef back . '' what started as a basic idea to shape concrete around a beach ball led to three years of research , testing and prototyping with the help of friends and college professors . watch as barber explains his passion for saving reefs '' `` our goal was to mimic nature , not dictate nature , '' says barber . `` and that meant that i could n't come up with an idea ; i had to design something that would fit exactly what the reef required . '' the result was what barber calls a `` reef ball . '' made of concrete engineered to last more than 500 years , reef balls are circular structures with a hollow center that serve as a base habitat upon which a natural reef can grow . portable , inexpensive and environmentally friendly , according to barber , reef balls can be built anywhere and are used to mimic and rehabilitate all forms of oceanic reefs , such as mangrove , oyster and coral reefs . they can also help control erosion and stabilize shorelines . watch as an organization in tampa tries to restore habitats for oysters '' to manufacture and place reef balls in marine habitats around the world , barber established the reef ball foundation in 1993 . today , the non-profit organization works with environmental agencies , universities , community groups and corporations and empowers others to build and restore their local marine ecosystems . '' -lsb- reefs -rsb- have an incredible bearing on human life , '' says barber . `` without conserving these resources , they 're going to be all gone before we even know what we 've lost . '' according to barber , marine conservation is n't just about reef balls , but they 're one important tool . `` it 's about saving natural reefs . it 's about changing our behaviors , '' says barber . `` it 's better to save the reef that you have than to build a new one . '' since its inception , the reef ball foundation has placed reef balls in more than 59 countries . `` for me , personally , the satisfaction comes from diving on a reef ball and seeing that the environment has been rehabilitated ; that the reef is actually there , '' says barber . `` and that our grandkids will be able to see the same thing .

306	kansas city , missouri -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush drew parallels between the aftermath of the vietnam war and the potential costs of pulling out of iraq in a speech wednesday . president bush draws parallels wednesday between the cost of pulling out of iraq and `` the tragedy of vietnam . '' `` three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left , '' bush told members of the veterans of foreign wars , at their convention in kansas city , missouri . `` whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , ' '' the president said . the white house billed the speech , as it did next week 's address to the american legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . bush also sought to shore up the perception of his support for iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki , after voicing some frustration with him on tuesday . `` prime minister maliki 's a good guy -- good man with a difficult job and i support him , '' bush said . `` and it 's not up to the politicians in washington , d.c. , to say whether he will remain in his position . watch bush reiterate his support for al-maliki '' sen. edward kennedy , d-massachusetts , said bush had drawn the wrong lesson from history : . `` america lost the war in vietnam because our troops were trapped in a distant country we did not understand supporting a government that lacked sufficient legitimacy with its people , '' kennedy said in a statement . sen. joe biden , democratic chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , invoked his own vietnam analogy in a statement released after the speech : . `` it 's the president 's policies that are pushing us toward another saigon moment -- with helicopters fleeing the roof of our embassy -- which he says he wants to avoid . '' biden said bush continues to cling to the premise that iraqis will rally behind a strong central government , but he believes that will not happen . `` there 's no trust within the iraqi government ; no trust of the government by the iraqi people ; no capacity of that government to deliver security or services ; and no prospect that it will build that trust or capacity any time soon , '' biden 's statement said . but house republican leader john boehner of ohio said more democrats are `` bucking their party leaders '' in acknowledging progress in iraq . `` many rank-and-file democrats have seen this progress firsthand and are now acknowledging the successes of a strategy they 've repeatedly opposed , '' boehner said in a statement . `` but democratic leaders , deeply invested in losing the war , would rather move the goalposts and claim that a precipitous withdrawal is the right approach despite the overwhelming evidence of significant progress . '' former presidential adviser david gergen said bush ran the risk of doing as much harm as good for his case . `` by invoking vietnam he raised the question , ` if you learned so much from history , how did you ever get us involved in another quagmire ? ' '' gergen said . gergen said he did agree with bush in one respect , though : `` he 's right , initially when we pulled back in vietnam there were massive killings . '' on tuesday , bush had expressed frustration with the pace of progress toward political reconciliation in iraq , saying if the iraqi government does n't `` respond to the demands of the people , they will replace the government . '' iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki on wednesday shot back at criticism of his government , including pointed remarks from a u.s. senator who called his administration `` nonfunctioning '' and urged iraq 's parliament to turn it out of office . speaking at a press conference in the syrian capital of damascus , al-maliki characterized such comments as `` irresponsible '' and said they `` overstep the bounds of diplomatic and political courtesy . '' government spokesman ali dabbagh told cnn that al-maliki was referring to comments made monday by sen. carl levin , the michigan democrat who chairs the senate armed services committee , who called on iraq 's parliament to turn al-maliki 's `` nonfunctioning '' government out of office when it returns in two weeks . levin said al-maliki 's government was `` too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders '' to reach a political settlement that would end the country 's sectarian and insurgent violence . in his speech , bush said withdrawing from vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising u.s. credibility , citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam . `` here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , '' bush said . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in iraq until the report comes out in september . it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say the petraeus report will have no effect on their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush referred to previous conflicts in asia in talking about the war against terror in iraq . `` there are many differences between the wars we fought in the far east and the war on terror we are fighting today , '' bush said . `` but one important similarity is that at their core , they are all ideological struggles . `` the militarists of japan and the communists in korea and vietnam were driven by a merciless vision for the proper ordering of humanity . they killed americans because we stood in the way of their attempt to force this ideology on others . '' bush said history proved skeptics wrong about japan 's ability to become a free society and will prove those who want to withdraw from iraq wrong . `` in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' bush said . `` today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies .

'' o'donnell says it takes highly trained , high energy , `` really special people '' to do such work day in and day out , especially when they 're up against `` some of the most dangerous individuals in the country . '' `` it 's not an exaggeration to say they 're the front of the front line , '' o'donnell says . `` it 's not going to get any more challenging than this in law enforcement .

309	pella , iowa -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a senior aide to republican presidential candidate mike huckabee admitted friday that the former arkansas governor had `` no foreign policy credentials '' after his comments reacting to the assassination of former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto raised questions . during an event friday in pella , iowa , huckabee said the crisis sparked by bhutto 's death should lead to a crackdown on illegal immigrants from pakistan . the huckabee official told cnn that when he said that , huckabee was trying to turn attention away from scrutiny of his foreign policy knowledge . huckabee 's foreign policy credentials have been under a microscope since the candidate admitted that he was unaware of an intelligence report that iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program earlier this month . `` in light of what happened in pakistan yesterday , it 's interesting that there are more pakistanis who have illegally crossed the border than of any other nationality except for those immediately south of our border , '' huckabee said friday . americans might `` look halfway around the world and say , ` how does that affect me ? ' ... we need to understand that violence and terror is significant when it happens in pakistan , -lsb- and -rsb- it 's more significant if it can happen in our own cities . and it happens if people can slip across our border and we have no control over them . '' `` the immigration issue is not so much about people coming to pick lettuce or make beds , it 's about people who could come with a shoulder-fired missile and could do serious damage and harm to us , '' huckabee said , `` and that 's what we need to be worried about . '' the huckabee official said he told huckabee that his reaction to the crisis in pakistan will be the story for the next several days , and until he is `` briefed and up to speed '' on pakistan , a good place for huckabee to draw the line is on illegal immigration . watch a report about the ` surprising tactic ' '' `` why does rudy giuliani get more credentials on homeland security than you do ? you 've been a governor , '' the huckabee campaign official said he told the candidate . the campaign official admitted that huckabee 's tough immigration talk is also aimed at helping him win male gop voters in iowa -- a bloc the official concedes the campaign has been losing ground with . huckabee said 660 pakistanis entered the country illegally last year . when asked by a reporter the source for that statistic , huckabee appeared unsure , saying , `` those are numbers that i got today from a briefing , and i believe they are cia and immigration numbers . '' the huckabee campaign later said the figure came from a march 2006 report by the denver post . but the border patrol told cnn on friday that it apprehended only `` a handful '' of illegal immigrants from pakistan in 2007 . the number of illegal immigrants from pakistan deported or apprehended is not mentioned in the latest report from the department of homeland security/office of immigration statistics . in 2005 , the nation did not make the list of the top 10 sources of illegal immigrants . the previous year , pakistan was the last country listed , but no specific numbers were given . huckabee is the gop front-runner in iowa , according to most polls . a los angeles times/bloomberg poll conducted december 20-23 and 26 has huckabee leading former massachusetts gov. mitt romney 36 percent to 28 percent among likely caucus goers . the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 7 percentage points . as the campaigns enter the final stretch before the iowa caucuses on january 3 , romney has gone on the attack against huckabee , particularly focusing on his record on illegal immigration issues while he was arkansas governor . huckabee 's friday comments on immigration came after he appeared to make another gaffe thursday , when he seemed to suggest incorrectly that pakistan was under martial law . watch huckabee 's response to bhutto 's assassination '' while commenting on bhutto 's death during an orlando , florida , press conference , huckabee told reporters that the united states ' first priority should be to find the responsible parties . `` but the most urgent thing to do is to offer our sincere sympathies and concerns to the family and to the people of pakistan , and that 's the first thing we would be doing other than , again , trying to ascertain who 's behind it , and what impact does it have on whether or not there 's going to be martial law continued in pakistan , suspension of the constitution , '' huckabee said . `` those are concerns that the united states certainly should have . '' later thursday , at an event in west des moines , iowa , huckabee told cnn that `` it was not that i was unaware it was suspended , two weeks ago , lifted . ... the point was , would it be reinstated , would it be placed back in ? all of the aspects of martial law have not been completely lifted even now . there 's still a heavy hand musharraf has used . '' conservative critics immediately pointed out that pakistani president pervez musharraf lifted the country 's state of martial law roughly two weeks ago . the slip `` ought to be really bad news for huckabee , '' said the national review 's jim geraghty , writing on the magazine 's web site . `` i 'm not sure how big assassination-related news will play in the first primary states . still , i think those misstatements will exacerbate the huck/not huck divide in gop circles . '' the national review has endorsed romney . but cnn senior political analyst bill schneider said the debate over whether huckabee has command of the nuances of the pakistan crisis would have little impact on his support . `` mike huckabee is a populist . his comments on pakistan reflect a populist understanding of the crisis , which , is to say , not much , '' schneider said . `` sure , the political establishment is snickering , but i doubt that his misstatements bother his supporters much .

310	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a colorado prosecutor friday asked a judge to dismiss the first-degree murder charge against tim masters , who spent nine years in prison until new dna evidence indicated someone else might have committed the crime . tim masters , center , walks out of a fort collins , colorado , courthouse tuesday with his attorney david wymore . court papers filed by district attorney larry abrahamson cited `` newly discovered '' evidence , but took pains to state that evidence did n't clear masters . `` while the newly discovered dna evidence does not exonerate timothy masters , it clearly warrants a complete re-examination of all the evidence related to the murder of peggy hettrick , '' the court papers state . the motion seeks dismissal of the charges `` in the interest of justice . '' it points out the dna testing used to uncover the new evidence was n't available when masters was investigated and tried . on tuesday a judge threw out masters ' 1999 murder conviction , and he was freed -- also `` in the interest of justice . '' although the motion signals that abrahamson is dropping the masters case , he did not rule out future prosecution . in a statement , the prosecutor cautioned : `` contrary to news reports , the dna testing results only suggest that there may be others , along with timothy masters , who should be investigated . these test results do not provide us with enough information to completely exonerate anyone . '' abrahamson said he has asked colorado attorney general john suthers to appoint a special prosecutor to continue the investigation of hettrick 's slaying . the attorney general will announce his decision early next week , abrahamson said . masters , 36 , has been investigated for hettrick 's murder since he was 15 . he has insisted he had nothing to do with her death , and no physical evidence ties him directly to the crime . watch masters describe his anger at police '' a jury convicted masters 12 years after the discovery of hettrick 's stabbed and sexually mutilated corpse in a field near his trailer . among the evidence jurors considered were a collection of knives found in master 's bedroom , gruesome sketches and testimony from a prosecution expert that he fit the psychological profile of a killer . masters ' defense team said he was framed , and that police and prosecutors sat on evidence that could have raised doubt about his guilt . the significance of friday 's motion to dismiss is largely procedural , but abrahamson indicated earlier this week that it might be unnecessary to try masters again . `` in light of newly discovered evidence revealed to me on friday , '' abrahamson said in a statement a week ago , `` i will be moving as expeditiously as possible to make the determination of whether all charges against timothy masters will be dismissed . '' abrahamson also has vowed to review all `` contested convictions '' in which advances in dna testing may prove useful . he said he wanted to examine the legal discovery process and that he had met with the fort collins police chief and his officers `` to discuss the critical flow of information with assurance that all information is available to our office and the defense . '' special prosecutor don quick filed a motion earlier this month citing four instances in which police and prosecutors should have handed over evidence to masters ' original defense team . see the key players in the case '' among them was a police interview with a plastic surgeon who said it was improbable that a teen could have made the meticulous cuts necessary to remove hettrick 's body parts . also , according to quick 's motion , police failed to divulge that a renowned fbi profiler warned police that masters ' penchant for doodling gruesome horror scenes did not tie him to the crime . investigations into how police and prosecutors handled the case continue . e-mail to a friend .

'' cnn.com readers describe meeting ledger in person , and call him humble and kind . below are a selection of their responses , some of which have been edited for length and clarity . donal logue , actor , of los angeles , california i met heath eight years ago while working on `` the patriot . '' he became a star while we were sequestered away in a small town in south carolina based on the strength of the dailies going back to los angeles . heath was a fantastically kind and sweet young man . he surrounded himself with his friends from australia and never forgot any of us he ever worked with . i last saw him in australia when he called my name on a melbourne street and introduced me to michelle , his -lrb- then -rrb- pregnant -lsb- girlfriend -rsb- . i have great memories of going for runs with him or watching a bootleg copy of a parker and stone 's musical called `` cannibal ! the musical of the donner party tragedy . '' heath must have been in a place of great pain and sadness to be split from his wife and child . he was sensitive and unfairly victimized in his native country by the unfortunate australian custom called the `` tall poppy syndrome '' in which an australian , the second he or she achieves global success , is immediately and arbitrarily accused of losing all of their humanity . not true . he was a sweet person , and less importantly , an unbelievably talented actor . maybe the best of his generation . dan bova of larchmont , new york once when i was driving in brooklyn , i got a flat tire . as i was jacking up my car , this deep voice from behind me said , `` need a hand ? '' it was heath ledger . i could n't believe it . he helped jack up my car and change the tire . he was really good with tools ! r. of perth , western australia i grew up with heath around the speedway racing circuit . i remember the night he was a little boy and his dad was racing speed cars at claremont speedway -lrb- my dad was in the race , too -rrb- . his dad was coming 3rd then in the final corner , the two lead cars spun out and heath 's dad kim took the lead and won the state title race . heath was standing a couple of rows in front of me with his mum and sister and they were all so excited , jumping up and down and cheering . he was about as happy as a little boy could be watching his dad become a champion . i remember that night because in the years that followed , i saw his parents marriage break up and it was like there was this moment in his childhood of pure joy that i witnessed . later heath would pit crew for graham jones , and i crewed for my dad and brother . heath and i were both the youngest on our crews so that meant our job was to take the fiberglass bonnets over to the hoses and wash the mud off after each race really dirty work but he managed to stay cleaner than the rest of us . crystal davis of toronto , ontario i met heath in l.a. at a mall a year or so ago . i was staring at him working up the nerve to ask for an autograph . he saw me , started laughing and walked towards me . he said i was white as an `` egg '' and asked if he could do anything . i said , no thanks ... yes i forgot to ask for the autograph . he touched my shoulder and told me to take it easy and walked away . he looked back several times and smiled . what a great memory i have of him . my prayers go out to his family and friends . dena michnowich of glen cove , new york i was walking in the lower east side of manhattan one day and i noticed a really cute man holding his little daughter on his shoulders . she looked just like him . he told her that they had to make a right and asked her to point them in the right direction , which she did . i soon realized that it was heath ledger and i got really excited . i was walking right up to them as they were waiting to cross the street . when i got close , i waved and he smiled at me . he was so handsome i got the chills . i could also sense that he had a very sweet spirit . it was a very special moment for me . i 'm so sad to hear that he died . leanne scorzoni of staten island , new york i worked as a nanny for a number of years in manhattan , and i ended up having a toddler class with my charge and heath , michelle and baby matilda . the couple was so polite and laid back at first i did n't recognize who they were . they were genuinely interested in their child , her development , and treating the rest of us -lrb- including staff -rrb- with respect . he will be sorely missed . michael williams of perth , western australia i met heath ledger many years ago while i was working at a local fast food outlet here in perth western australia . he came through to order and i was amazed at how polite , kind and friendly he was . he stopped to sign autographs while he waited knowing that to the people asking him he was somewhat of a hero . he did all this with the great australian attitude that he had and a smile on his face , he was one superstar that took stardom well and in his stride , i for one feel thankful that i have met this great person . i send my deepest sympathy to his family and say to them that you do not mourn his passing alone ; the people of perth share your grief . tracy kimball of rock hill , south carolina i met heath ledger in 1999 while he was filming `` the patriot '' in south carolina . i was a reporter for a daily newspaper there and he was at a press conference about the movie at historic brattonsville , a revolutionary-era plantation . he was so very kind and was more than happy to sign my newspaper . the media was flocking around mel gibson , but seeing a new young and dashingly gorgeous guy standing off to himself , i approached him and asked for his autograph . he flashed that smile , grabbed my pen and used my back to sign the newspaper i was holding . we had a conversation , but i do n't remember it because i was so enamored . i had never heard of him before because the only american movie he had filmed was `` ten things i hate about you , '' which i had not yet seen . i went back to the paper where i worked and wrote a story about the new hot aussie star that would surely become hugely successful in america . his death really saddens me . he was such a talented actor and a new dad . having a child the same age as his daughter , it makes me even sadder to think of her missing her father . amanda olmstead of penticton , british columbia i met heath when he was filming `` brokeback mountain '' in my hometown of fort macleod . he was a down to earth man with amazing talent . his portrayal of ennis del mar was life-changing for many of my friends . i am truly saddened by his death . kristy o'connor of sydney , australia my heart goes out to heath 's family and little matilda , i met heath one time at a prenatal yoga class in sydney with michelle and was in awe of his devotion and attention to her . he was a true gentleman and i 'm sure an amazing father . to make assumptions as to how or why he died is to bring more pain to an already devastated family . adrian k. of perth , western australia i met heath one night on the town in perth . the one-degree of separation rule in perth made him a friend of a friend . we had a brief and quiet chat . what struck me was his calm in the face of his monstrous burgeoning celebrity . with both of his feet planted firmly on the ground , he seemed to be facing the publicity with stoic resolve . goodnight , heath . you were a good bloke . `` a sad fan '' in chicago , illinois i was an extra in the movie `` dark knight , '' which filmed in chicago this past summer . i spend an entire weekend on set with heath . he was rather quiet most of the time between takes , but seemed to be a nice , likeable guy . it was great to watch him work , as he was very committed to his craft . his death is a great loss . kelly fishburne of west palm beach , florida i met heath ledger while working in atlanta . we both were taking a cnn tour . he was silly , smiling all the time and we spoke about horses and riding lessons . he was also talking about the movie the patriot he filmed with mel gibson . he had to do lots of riding . he was down to earth and so very talkative . just a normal guy , hanging out . a real gentleman . jessi lee of central , south carolina i really enjoyed heath 's acting . his best movie was my favorite movie of 2005 , `` lords of dogtown . '' heath played the somewhat obnoxious skip engblom , but thinking of all the other actors who could have taken the roll , i do n't think anyone could have done it better . even two of the original zephyr shop boys themselves . tony alva & stacy peralta , said when heath came in & did the voice he would use in the film , it was like hearing skip from the past . e-mail to a friend .

313	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- valerie gooding is in the top five most powerful businesswomen in europe as named by the financial times . she runs global health and care organization bupa and under her leadership it has grown to over 8 million customers in over 190 countries and record revenues . cnn 's todd benjamin spoke to her in london and began by asking her why there are so few women at the top . she said it goes beyond family issues . gooding : women sometimes do n't put themselves forward for things . and one of the things i think about and talk about a lot is that women often lack confidence to go for the next job , the top job . they sometimes do n't wish to compete or they do n't think they 're good enough for the next thing . benjamin : why do you think that is ? gooding : partly a lack of role models , partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family , in work . but also i think there is still -- i do n't like to call it a glass ceiling , but i think there is still an unseen barrier for women , which is that , if you ask most business people , would they like to promote more women , they would all say yes , they 'd love to : `` where are these women , i want to promote them , '' will be the answer . but often they do n't really automatically think of a woman first for a top job . benjamin : and what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top ? gooding : well , first of all , to learn as much as you can and to make sure you 've got the right experience , the right qualifications , and to enjoy each job for its own interest and job satisfaction . but i think another piece of advice i would give to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want , because i think one thing that happens with women , which perhaps is a gender difference , is that women often hang back and think `` i will be noticed for my results , everybody will see how great i am because i 've delivered these exceptional outcomes '' . but actually life is n't like that , you have to tell people about your results and your achievements , and men are often better at doing that than women are . benjamin : what do you think separates good leadership from great leadership ? gooding : well , i think good leaders should be judged on their results . and i think of a good leader you should be able to say `` she transformed the business , '' `` she upped the performance , '' `` she exceeded the expectations of the stakeholders . '' i think of a great leader i would go to that old chinese saying , `` of a great leader the people will say `` we did it ourselves '' '' . benjamin : do you think that women in general as managers are more inclusive than men ? gooding : no , i do n't . in fact , i sometimes find these gender differences , when sort of represented in the business environment , are actually just not very useful . i think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and i do n't think it goes down to straightforward gender divide . because i have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial , and i 've equally seen men who are very consultative . so , i do n't just think it divides that way . benjamin : you clearly love what you do . what is it about business that you think is such a buzz ? gooding : it 's the constant challenge , there 's always something new , there 's a new competitor , there 's a new pressure , there 's a new opportunity , there 's a new challenge , i think that 's what keeps us all going . i think it 's the thrill of the chase , basically . e-mail to a friend .

316	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the head of blackwater usa on sunday rejected a mounting series of reports suggesting the private contractor 's security guards opened fire on innocent iraqi civilians last month . blackwater ceo erik prince said sunday that guards `` definitely '' faced insurgent fire september 16 . `` there was definitely incoming small arms fire from insurgents '' in the september 16 incident in baghdad , founder and ceo erik prince told cnn 's wolf blitzer on `` late edition . '' there was no `` deliberate violence , '' committed by blackwater employees , he added . still , when asked whether it is possible someone with blackwater `` screwed up '' in the incident , prince replied , `` certainly it 's possible . '' he said he expects the fbi investigation to provide many answers . meanwhile , u.s. and iraqi officials continue discussing baghdad 's demand that blackwater be expelled from iraq within six months , the associated press reported sunday . american officials are also coming up with ways to fill the security gap if blackwater is forced to leave , ap reported . blackwater guards , protecting u.s. officials in iraq , face dangerous circumstances every day and have navigated the vast majority of those situations without any violence , prince told cnn . the guards just try to do their jobs , and are `` not trying to make any trouble , '' he said . the iraqi government accuses blackwater guards of opening fire without provocation on civilians in a crowded area in baghdad on september 16 , killing 17 and wounding 27 . survivors told fbi investigators blackwater guards shot at civilians presenting no threat . watch a blackwater witness describe his account '' the first u.s. soldiers to arrive on the scene after the incident told military investigators they found no evidence contractors were fired upon , a source familiar with a preliminary u.s. military report told cnn . the soldiers found evidence suggesting the guards fired on cars attempting to leave and found weapon casings on the scene matching only those used by u.s. military and contractors , the military source said . but prince on sunday told cnn , `` in the incident reports i 've seen , at least three of our armored vehicles were hit by small arms fire , incoming , and one of them damaged , which actually delayed their departure from the traffic circle while they tried to rig a tow . `` so there was definitely incoming small-arms fire from insurgents .

317	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the announced pregnancy of jamie lynn spears -- the 16-year-old children 's television star and younger sister of beleaguered pop star britney spears -- is casting new light on how states deal with the thorny issue of consensual sex among teens . jamie lynn spears , shown in september , stars in the popular nickelodeon series `` zoey 101 . '' spears , the star of nickelodeon 's `` zoey 101 , '' told ok! magazine that she 's pregnant and that the father is her 18-year-old boyfriend . there has been no public talk of criminal prosecution in the case . consensual sex between the two may well have been legal , depending on where and when it took place . but critics of the nation 's statutory rape laws say that laws that are ignored in some cases can be used to put other teens in prison and land them on sex-offender registries . watch cnn 's sunny hostin on what the law says '' `` you have a disturbing disparity in how these laws are enforced , '' said jonathan turley , a law professor at george washington university . `` i have no problem at all with nailing adults who sleep with children , but i have a problem with the prosecution of teenagers in consensual relationships . `` what this case should focus the nation on is having a more evenhanded approach to these cases . '' watch a psychologist talk about how spears ' pregnancy could lead to parents talking to their kids about sex '' in louisiana , where spears lives , it is a misdemeanor for someone age 17 to 19 to have consensual sex with someone age 15 to 17 if the difference between their ages is more than two years . in california , where she sometimes tapes her television show , it 's a misdemeanor to have sex with someone younger than 18 if the offender is less than three years older . someone more than three years older could be charged with a felony . according to ok! magazine , which first reported the news tuesday , spears said the father of her baby is longtime boyfriend casey aldridge . turley said most states have similar laws but rely on prosecutors to be selective in enforcing them . but that 's a recipe for legal problems , he said . the issue drew international attention when a georgia teen was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17 . in 2005 , genarlow wilson was tried for the rape of a 17-year-old girl at a hotel-room party . while he was found not guilty of that charge , he was convicted of aggravated child molestation for the act with the 15-year-old -- even though he was less than two years older . georgia law , which has since been changed , required a mandatory 10-year sentence on the charge of aggravated child molestation and required wilson to register as a sex offender when he was released . under the revised georgia law , the act now would be a misdemeanor . now 21 , wilson was released from prison in october -- after serving more than two years -- when the state supreme court ruled his sentence was `` grossly disproportionate to his crime . '' `` the current laws leave too much to prosecutorial discretion , '' turley said . `` we saw in the wilson case how prosecutorial discretion can lead to grotesque results . '' he said statutory rape prosecutions of teens are more common in southern states and small towns than they are elsewhere in the country or in big cities . b.j. bernstein , wilson 's attorney , argued throughout his case that wilson was imprisoned for an act that , while perhaps morally questionable , probably is going on among teens everywhere . `` if you prosecuted , even with misdemeanors , all those cases , you 'd clog up the justice system with kids having sex , '' she said . `` it 's a social issue -- and it may be something that parents do n't want to happen or wish would n't happen at that age -- but it should n't be a crime . '' spears , who turned 16 on april 4 and says she is 12 weeks into her pregnancy , told the magazine she plans to raise her child in louisiana , `` so it can have a normal family life . '' nickelodeon released a statement saying the network respects spears ' decision `` to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation . '' e-mail to a friend .

325	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- despite the obvious claims of younger rivals cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi , few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted ricardo izecson dos santos leite as the 2007 world footballer of the year . brazilian genius kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 world footballer of the year award . the prestigious ballon d'or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and kaka 's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old brazilian 's current standing in world football . when ac milan defeated liverpool in the champions league final in athens , avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in istanbul two years previously , it enabled kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft europe 's premier trophy -- a winner 's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance . kaka 's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the san siro from sao paulo for a fee of just $ 8.5 million in the summer of 2003 . unlike many a brazilian sporting genius , kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town . he was born into a comfortable middle class brasilia family , where football was not the only hope of a bright future . however , it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by sao paulo , after his family had moved there , at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old . kaka 's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and felipe scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 world cup finals , earning him a winners ' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against costa rica . a year later , and kaka was on his way to milan . within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the rossoneri lift the scudetto and the european super cup . throughout his career , kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games . yet to describe kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice . tall , elegant and blessed with astonishing skill , milan and brazil utilize kaka 's ability superbly . milan coach carlo ancelotti soon recognized kaka 's genius , changing his team 's system to a 4-4-1-1 , playing the brazilian behind a main target man . with andrea pirlo and gennaro gattuso holding the central midfield area , kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker , be it filippo inzaghi , ronaldo or alberto gilardino . and kaka does this with devastating effect , running at the opposition with pace and power , finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play . the fly in the ointment for milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season . although they have already reached the last 16 of the champions league , the club are floundering in serie a and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season 's competition unless they win the trophy . real madrid have coveted kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if milan do n't secure a place among europe 's elite . e-mail to a friend .
326	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sens. hillary clinton and barack obama each accused the other of borrowing portions of their presidential campaign speeches monday . massachusetts gov. deval patrick , left , on the stump with sen. barack obama . the clinton campaign accused obama of borrowing from a close supporter , and the illinois senator responded by saying his own words have been used by clinton . on a conference call with reporters , clinton spokesman howard wolfson said it was clear obama had `` lifted rhetoric '' from massachusetts gov. deval patrick . late monday , clinton followed up with a swipe of her own . `` if your whole candidacy is about words , then they should be your own words , '' clinton said in madison , wisconsin . `` that 's what i think . '' obama downplayed the significance of the accusation . `` i 've written two books , wrote most of my speeches . so i think putting aside the question ... in terms of whether my words are my own , i think that would be carrying it too far , '' obama said . `` deval and i do trade ideas all the time , and you know he 's occasionally used lines of mine , '' obama said . obama said he also used some of deval 's words at a jefferson-jackson dinner in wisconsin . `` i would add i 've noticed on occasion sen. clinton has used words of mine as well , '' said obama . `` as i said before , i really do n't think this is too big of a deal . '' obama campaign officials said clinton had a pattern of borrowing from some of her rival 's signature phrases , including `` yes , we can '' and `` fired up , ready to go . '' they circulated a youtube video and list of these alleged instances to reporters . the clinton campaign earlier pointed to similarities between the words of obama and patrick that have raised eyebrows and attracted traffic on youtube . a central passage in a speech obama gave saturday -- aimed at convincing voters that his campaign is not just about lofty rhetoric -- is adapted from one that patrick used in his 2006 campaign , the obama campaign said when asked about it . the controversy is lost on the massachusetts governor , who endorsed obama . obama 's campaign had patrick call the new york times over the weekend and issue a statement . `` senator obama and i are long-time friends and allies . we often share ideas about politics , policy and language , '' patrick said in the statement . `` the argument in question , on the value of words in the public square , is one about which he and i have spoken frequently before . given the recent attacks from senator clinton , i applaud him responding in just the way he did . '' watch a comparison of obama 's and patrick 's speeches '' the obama campaign also confirmed comments chief strategist david axelrod -- an adviser on obama 's senate campaign and patrick 's gubernatorial run -- made to the new york times about the speeches . `` they often riff off one another . they share a world view , '' axelrod told the times about obama and patrick . `` both of them are effective speakers whose words tend to get requoted and arguments tend to be embraced widely . '' responding to attacks from clinton that he offers words while she offers action , obama has been arguing that words matter . saturday night at a gala for the wisconsin democratic party , obama said to frequent applause , `` do n't tell me words do n't matter ! ' i have a dream . ' just words . ` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal . ' just words . ` we have nothing to fear but fear itself . ' just words , just speeches ! '' in 2006 , patrick , fending off attacks from his rival kerry healey , told a crowd , `` her dismissive point , and i hear it a lot from her staff , is all i have to offer is words . just words . ` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal ' -- just words . just words . ` we have nothing to fear but fear itself ' -- just words . ` ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country ' -- just words . ' i have a dream ' -- just words . '' clinton has argued that while obama provides rousing speeches , she has the stronger grasp of the issues and the knowledge of how to use the presidency to start making changes from `` day one . '' speaking last week at a general motors plant in ohio , she said , `` there 's a big difference between us -- speeches versus solutions , talk versus action . you know , some people may think words are change . but you and i know better . words are cheap . i know it takes work .

'' one can not be `` sorry '' for torturing and killing animals . as you know it 's been proven that those with the ability to do so also have a stronger chance of being abusive to humans . how can we allow someone like that to be a role model for children ?

329	colombo , sri lanka -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- humble woodcutter mohammed sultan nafeek 's teenage daughter moved to saudi arabia to work as a housemaid to support her family after they were displaced by the 2004 tsunami . now she is on death row , and all he can do is pray . razeena mohammad -lrb- left -rrb- and mohammad sultan nafeek , parents of rizana nafeek . rizana , who was 17 when she started work in saudi arabia , was convicted of killing a 4-month-old baby boy in her care just two weeks into her job . nafeek says the child died accidentally , choking on milk . his daughter was sentenced to beheading in a case rights groups say underlines the vulnerability of many of the 1.5 million sri lankans who work abroad -- nearly 400,000 of them in saudi arabia alone . `` our family was suffering hardship , and so our daughter volunteered to go and work abroad to send money home , '' nafeek told reuters by telephone from his modest home in mutur in sri lanka 's war-torn northeast . after the december 2004 tsunami forced them from their home , the family was displaced again by renewed civil war between the state and separatist tamil tiger rebels . nafeek visited saudi arabia with sri lanka 's deputy foreign minister this month in a bid to secure clemency and met with relations of the dead child 's parents but came away empty handed . under saudi law , a pardon is the gift of the family of the victim , and so far the parents of the dead child have refused to meet either the family or sri lankan officials . `` the cops told us : ` go and pray to allah . if you can get the forgiveness of the parents , your daughter will be free , ' '' he said . `` so i am praying all the time . '' `` if we had been able to meet the parents , we are sure they would have been willing to forgive our daughter after seeing our situation . '' the sri lankan government is investigating the agency that sent rizana to work abroad when she was technically still a child but remains hopeful she will be pardoned or exonerated . `` i am fairly confident , '' said deputy foreign minister hussein bhaila . `` we have spoken to tribal leaders of their particular tribe , we have spoken to area officials ... it is they who will now have to speak -lrb- to the parents -rrb- . '' `` his excellency the president -lrb- mahinda rajapaksa -rrb- has been following this case very keenly . this is an exceptional case because of her tender age , '' he added . rights groups accuse the government of failing to protect its expatriate workers -- one of the main sources of foreign-exchange revenues for the $ 23 billion economy -- with legal aid . they also decry saudi arabia 's legal system . `` this case raises many troubling questions about the treatment of children and foreigners in saudi arabia 's criminal-justice system , '' human rights watch said in a statement issued overnight . `` international law prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18 . '' saudi arabia executed four sri lankans convicted of armed robbery earlier this year , and did not inform sri lankan authorities beforehand . sri lanka reinstated its own death penalty in 2004 after the murder of a high court judge , but it has been dormant since 1976 . there is no indication any of the dozens of convicted murderers , rapists and drug smugglers on death row in sri lanka and effectively serving life prison terms will actually be executed . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .

'' what was it in your character that you think made him make that observation ? branson : well i suspect the fact that at age 13 i 'm writing him letters on how he could organize the catering better and how the school could save money , and if they save money they could then put it into better facilities for the students . and i managed to persuade him to give me a study to start my magazine and it was only when he actually finally came to me and said `` look , you 're either going to have to do your school work or your magazine , '' that i said `` well , goodbye . i 'm off to do the magazine , but thanks very much .

335	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal agents have determined new york gov. eliot spitzer used a high-priced call-girl ring at least eight times in recent months , and agents had him under surveillance twice this year , sources familiar with the investigation said wednesday . sources say new york gov. eliot spitzer used a call-girl service eight times in recent months . spitzer announced his resignation wednesday , two days after reports of his connection to the emperors club vip became public . he has not been charged with a crime . he told reporters wednesday , `` i can not allow my private failings to disrupt the people 's work . '' the resignation will take effect monday . watch spitzer say he will resign '' the sources said the investigation began when new york 's north fork bank notified the treasury department about suspicious transfers of money from spitzer 's bank accounts . that investigation led agents to the alleged organizers of the prostitution ring , four of whom were charged in a criminal complaint last week , the sources said . a grand jury in new york is likely to hear evidence in the case soon , said kathleen mullin , an attorney who said she represents one of the ring 's employees . mullin would not identify her client , but said she was not the woman identified only as `` kristen '' linked to spitzer in court papers . she said her client and other women who worked for the emperors club have been asked to testify before the grand jury . asked if her client had any encounters with spitzer , mullin said , `` we have no information regarding the governor . '' wiretaps on suspected members of the ring , authorized in january , yielded more than 5,000 telephone calls and text messages and another 6,000-plus e-mails , according to court papers . in those intercepts , the organizers told clients how to arrange and pay for their trysts , a federal agent 's affidavit states . the affidavit identified clients by number , with spitzer designated `` client 9 , '' a source with knowledge of the investigation told cnn this week . sources familiar with the investigation said federal authorities wednesday were trying to clamp down on leaks of the investigation 's details . see a timeline of the investigation '' the affidavit states `` client 9 '' paid $ 4,300 for 2 1/2 hours with a call girl he arranged to meet at washington 's mayflower hotel , with some of that a deposit on a future session . court papers state he also paid for train tickets , cab fare , mini-bar and room service charges for kristen -- a 5-foot-5 , 105-pound brunette he arranged to meet the night of february 13 . kristen is a 22-year-old would-be singer from new jersey , the new york times reported wednesday . the newspaper said ashley youmans -- now known as ashley alexandra dupre -- was identified in court documents as kristen . dupre has not been charged with a crime . she made a brief appearance monday in u.s. magistrate court as a witness against four people charged with operating the emperor 's club , the times said . in an entry on her myspace page , dupre says she left `` a broken family '' and `` abuse '' in 2004 , eventually settling in manhattan `` to pursue my music career . '' `` i am all about my music , and my music is all about me , '' she writes on her myspace page . `` it flows from what i 've been through , what i 've seen and how i feel . '' dupre 's mother , carolyn capalbo , told the times she and her daughter were close , adding that `` she obviously got involved in something much larger than her . '' spitzer , whose squeaky-clean image as a corporate corruption-buster made him a rising democratic star , testified to the house financial services committee the next day about the effect of the mortgage meltdown . he took a state plane from buffalo , new york , to washington and back to new york , his office confirmed tuesday . sources told cnn that fbi agents had spitzer under surveillance at the mayflower that night -- and on an earlier occasion , on january 26 , when no prostitute showed up . his resignation is unlikely to affect decisions about whether he will face prosecution , the sources said . his attorneys were negotiating wednesday with the u.s. attorney 's office in new york in an effort to avoid criminal charges , a source told cnn . but in a statement issued after the governor 's resignation , u.s. attorney michael garcia said no agreement had been reached between his office and the governor `` relating to his resignation or any other matter . '' the resignation could be a factor in the u.s. presidential race . spitzer was a superdelegate , one of nearly 800 party leaders and officials who cast their votes at the democratic national convention . they are free to vote for any candidate they wish . spitzer was a political ally of new york sen. hillary clinton , who is currently in a tight race with illinois sen. barack obama to win the democratic nomination . a candidate must get 2,024 delegates to clinch the democratic nomination . with the race so close , superdelegates could play a larger role in determining the democratic presidential candidate than in past elections . according to two sources who spoke tuesday with cnn , spitzer hit the federal radar when a bank reported to the internal revenue service that a significant amount of money had been suspiciously transferred from one account to another . late last year , upon investigating the movement of money that the bank initially reported , the irs found that the accounts were connected to spitzer , the sources said . the irs contacted the fbi , which joined the case to investigate the possibility of government corruption . federal law requires a banking institution to file a suspicious activity report when the institution suspects a transaction is linked to a federal crime . more specifically , banks are required to report to the irs any transactions totaling $ 5,000 or more if the transactions `` involve potential money laundering or a violation of the bank secrecy act . '' the act requires businesses to keep documents that are useful for identifying and investigating money laundering . after receiving the irs report last year , the fbi corruption squad linked the account transfers to a prostitution ring , according to sources . the fbi criminal division joined the probe to look into the prostitution ring , while the federal corruption team continued its investigation into spitzer . legal experts not involved in the case have said spitzer could face some type of money-laundering charge , such as structuring a financial transaction to evade federal bank reporting requirements by breaking up a large transaction into smaller ones . sources tell cnn that prosecutors have considered pursuing a structuring charge , but have run into some difficulty . and richard smith , a former justice department official , said structuring charges are `` fairly difficult to prove .

336	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the presidents of sudan and chad signed a non-aggression agreement late thursday , aiming to halt cross-border hostilities between the two african nations . chad president idriss deby , right , and sudan 's president omar al-beshir , left , shake hands after signing the pact . the signing came after nearly two full days of talks in dakar , senegal , between sudan president omar al-beshir and idriss deby , the president of chad . senegalese president abdoulaye wade facilitated the talks , and united nations secretary general ban ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. `` the idea is to get the governments of sudan and chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country , '' said united nations spokesman farhan haq . each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government . the rival nations ' armies have skirmished several times . the united nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled darfur region of sudan and chad . they allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked n'djamena , the capital of chad , in early february . as recently as thursday , just hours before the agreement was signed , chad issued a communique saying rebels from sudan had crossed the border . chad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow deby 's regime . the united nations says the swelling number of darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern chad is causing serious strain on the region . kingsley amaning , the u.n. 's humanitarian coordinator for chad , said more than 10,000 people from darfur , in sudan , have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern chad . they join some 240,000 darfurians who have lived in chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced chadians also living there . the number of displaced chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there , kingsley said . haq said the united nations , which has peacekeeping troops in the darfur region , will work to assure sudan and chad carry out the terms of thursday 's deal . the countries have signed several peace agreements in the past , only to see renewed violence flare up . e-mail to a friend .

'' residents were once told by baa that there would be no fifth terminal , but the company is planning to forge further ahead despite the concerns of environmental groups . `` terminal 5 stands as a monument to the binge-flying culture this government has done so much to encourage , '' greenpeace transport campaigner anita goldsmith told the uk press association . `` it 's part of an obsession with expansion which can only mean more flights , more emissions and more climate change .

339	london , england -- football will pay its tribute to the legend of manchester united 's busby babes on wednesday in moments of remembrance on the 50th anniversary of the munich air disaster . a memorial stone recalls the place of the munich air disaster in kirchtrudering near munich . eight players lost their lives on february 6 , 1958 , when flight 609 zu crashed on the third attempt to take off after re-fuelling in germany as united returned from knocking red star belgrade out of the european cup . sir matt busby 's side , back-to-back english champions and well positioned for a hat-trick attempt , were arguably on course to become the best united team . the united players killed at munich were geoff bent , aged 25 , roger byrne -lrb- 28 -rrb- , eddie colman -lrb- 21 -rrb- , mark jones -lrb- 24 -rrb- , david pegg -lrb- 22 -rrb- , tommy taylor -lrb- 26 -rrb- , liam whelan -lrb- 22 -rrb- and 21-year-old duncan edwards who died in hospital 15 days after the crash . they and the other 15 people who lost their lives will be remembered with a commemorative service at old trafford while a short ceremony , organised by supporters , will also take place at the memorial site in kirchtrudering , on the outskirts of munich . in keeping with tradition , united supporters will also gather under the memorial plaque at old trafford where the clock is fixed at the exact time of the final fateful take-off attempt . later in the day , a minute 's silence will take place ahead of england 's friendly with switzerland at wembley as a further mark of respect . as he bows his head during this week 's munich commemorations , survivor harry gregg 's mind will understandably flash back to that snow-laden runway , but only briefly . the 75-year-old ulsterman prefers not to remember the afternoon he lost so many friends among the victims , but instead the days when the dream of the ` busby babes ' was still vibrant and alive . goalkeeper gregg , hailed a hero in the wake of the crash after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors , is adamant those are the times which always burn brightest in his memory . `` i was part of something that was a very , very beautiful thing at that time , '' said gregg , who cost united a record 23,000 pounds sterling when he joined from doncaster rovers two months before the disaster . `` i 'll always be proud of that . the fact there 's going to be a minute 's silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people i played with , but one must remember as well there were other people on board that aircraft , a lot more people . `` i want the minute 's silence to be over and then i want to remember the happy times , that 's what i want the world to remember , that 's what i want the families to remember .

340	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the amazon rainforest is so vast and full of life that even its defenders do n't know exactly what it is they are protecting . in the past 40 years , roughly 20 percent of the amazon rainforest has been wiped out . `` the wealth of biodiversity is so immense , we can not even estimate the amount we do n't know , '' says cláudio c. maretti , brazil-based director for conservation for the world wildlife fund . `` every new expedition you do to the amazon , you might find one new species of fish . every other , you might find some new bird or frog . '' the amazon rainforest , which encompasses an area nearly as large as the continental united states and stretches across nine countries , is considered the world 's richest and most varied natural habitat , with several million species of insects , plants , birds and fish calling it home . it also plays an important role in regulating earth 's temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air . but the amazon has been under pressure from outside forces for decades . in the past 40 years , roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out . maretti says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees . `` we have been deforesting at enormous rates , '' maretti says . the chief drivers of this deforestation are large-scale business interests involved in logging , mining , agriculture and , especially , cattle ranching . some of this activity is sanctioned by the government ; much of it is not . greenpeace estimates as much as 80 percent of the logging is illegal . the amazon rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction . the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations estimates that 50,000 square miles of forest -- more than three times the size of switzerland -- are lost each year because of clearing and degradation . the threat is particularly acute in the more tropical areas of south america , africa and southeast asia . cambodia , for example , lost nearly 30 percent of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005 , according to fao . vietnam lost close to 55 percent of its primary forests , fao found . and nigeria lost nearly 56 percent of its primary forests over the same period , the worst rate of forest loss in the world , according to fao . the destruction of the earth 's oldest and richest forests is not a new phenomenon , but the rate of destruction has increased in recent decades . `` worldwide , one-half of all forests we 've lost in the last 10,000 years has occurred in the last 80 years . half of that was destroyed in the last 30 years , '' says scott paul , forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace . paul says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market , not to meet local needs . `` the timber market , and also for agriculture , mining : when it plugs into the international economic system , that 's when you 've got to watch it , '' he says . paul would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product they 're consuming was harvested . `` if you buy wine and cheese , we can tell the region and the year . but forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side . there is no way to determine if something came from a well-managed forest or an illegal forest where there is slavery , murder , drug trade , etc. , '' he says . while the story of the world 's old-growth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction , forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas , such as the northeast region of the united states and parts of europe . this thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species . `` northern new england is the only place in the eastern united states where you have the potential for large-scale wilderness where wolves , lynxes , cougars , woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored , '' according to michael j. kellett , executive director of restore : the north woods . `` we could literally have almost the entire ecosystem of the maine woods as it once was . '' with large-scale agriculture all but gone from new england and logging companies concentrating their attention elsewhere , kellett 's biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of maine . his proposed solution : create a national park . in brazil in recent years , the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the amazon 's destruction . last october , brazil said the rate of deforestation plunged 41 percent because of the enforcement of environmental laws . environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of brazil 's currency against the dollar , making the country 's exports more expensive . the world wildlife fund 's maretti is hopeful that brazil , with international help , will be able to protect even more of the amazon , an area he considers among the most vital natural habitats in the world . `` we do have strong civil society . we do have more governance , '' maretti says . `` but we certainly need support from abroad . i do n't believe brazil can do this job alone .

341	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- not only is sheikha lubna al qasimi the first woman to hold a ministerial post in the united arab emirates , the first female minister of economy in the gulf , and the first to start a middle eastern bb marketplace , but she 's also the first minister - anywhere in the world - to launch her own perfume line . member of sharjah royal family and one of forbes ' 100 most powerful women , sheikha lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of united arab emirates in 2004 . her background is in it and before the government appointment worked at the dubai ports authority where she gained the `` distinguished government employee award '' in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes . in 2000 , sheikha lubna founded tejari , the first middle eastern business-to-business marketplace . as a result of tejari -lrb- arabic for commerce -rrb- 70 percent of dubai 's government purchases are made online , while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch . one of the cornerstones of sheikha lubna 's work has been to allow for foreign ownership , so when john defterios met up with her , he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy . sheikha lubna : we are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors . we will evaluate each sector , from the service side , finance , accounting . and any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth , then we will focus on that : on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company . defterios : if you look at the middle east , specifically within this gulf region , it 's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership . is this society in the region ready for this move ? sheikha lubna : interestingly , the united arab emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside . we host 200 nationalities , so for us , the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community . so in many ways i think the openness is only a natural path : it 's an organic path to continue the openness that exists . foreign direct investment is not your own wealth . when you have your own wealth , you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes , because it 's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure . however , if you look at foreign direct investment , it mandates you to be much more transparent , you have to be very diligent about your work , and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment . defterios : it 's interesting , you read the front line of the dp world , p&o acquisition and the furor it created in the united states particularly within congress . what are the lessons , not just from the uae perspective , but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process ? sheikha lubna : first of all , i think it is important to understand , in this global world , there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere . liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad . we 've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad . and we 've seen this where the uae invests in the far east , australia , asia as well as in europe and the united states . what 's more important to understand is that if you 're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that i do n't want to sell to this particular organization versus another , there are other places . defterios : that 's not a veiled message your saying , that 's pretty forthright this comment . sheikha lubna : but it 's a message to all of us . if today i lock up my investment opportunity here , money will not come to me , money will go somewhere else . when i have investment coming from abroad , it creates confidence in this country that ' i am a global image ' . so when i say it , i am not directing this as a message to a particular country . i am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation , when it comes to responsibility , when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country . so that 's really a lesson that 's very very critical . defterios : a number of firsts : the first to start a b2b marketplace ; the first female minister within the country , an economy minister ; and the first to launch a perfume range as well . what is it all about ? trailblazing , setting examples , being an entrepreneur ? how would you describe what you 're doing here ? sheikha lubna : everybody laughs about the perfume . one , i think the united arab emirates , since inception -lrb- it 's not from today but from the founder late sheikh zayed -rrb- has always given equal opportunities for women . but it 's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push , and what it is that we can do and not do . in my personal belief you need a bridge , you need a door opener for women . and sometimes women do not want to take the risk . sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving . i had the opportunity and i had the trust from the government and the community , so to me , it is setting the example internally for the young women , and men by the way . be it in technology , or economy or e-commerce . defterios : and the perfume line is the exclamation point ? sheikha lubna : a young woman , actually a perfume creator , who sells exclusively to saks fifth avenue in dubai , decided to create a perfume with my name . so i had two mandates from her . one , i had to smell it , otherwise if it does n't smell good i 'm not going to take it as a name . so one , i had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume . and it 's an arabic perfume by the way . and second , my mandate was that i would only launch it with my name for her , if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the friends of cancer patients . e-mail to a friend .

'' wissman is uniquely positioned to `` get everybody involved . '' more than a priest or even a bishop in this arts-mission field , he 's a cardinal in the industry , the chairman of img artists , a major player in world artists ' representation . img 's roster includes violinists joshua bell and itzhak perlman , mezzo-soprano fredericka von stade , flutist james galway , guitarist christopher parkening , the joffrey ballet and composer jay greenberg , among many others . wissman has just announced a new managing director for img in north and south america , elizabeth sobol . she is , herself , a co-producer of a new festival in boca raton , florida , and architect of a highly publicized new joint venture for img with gorfaine-schwartz , the agency representing trumpeter-composer chris botti , cellist yo-yo ma , singer-songwriter james taylor and hollywood film composer john williams . no matter how far-flung the festivals and events , wissman stays near his roots . `` i 'm a pianist , '' he says , `` a concert pianist . i still play , i play from time to time in the festivals . so i 'm a musician , i come from the arts . '' in the case of napa 's festival del sole , wissman has a co-founder , san francisco-based attorney richard walker , who has a specialization in artists ' management . watch an audio slide show in which richard walker talks about the atmosphere of the festival '' having worked with mikhail pletnev 's russian national orchestra , walker says , since its inception in 1990 as the first symphonic entity founded after the soviet union 's collapse , he emphasizes the stylistic range demanded in festival work . and walker echoes wissman 's interest in making these festivals oases in the itinerant lives of world-traveling artists . `` the events that surround the musical performances , '' walker says , `` are attended by the artists , themselves -- a time of camaraderie for them because they see each other and spend time enjoying each other 's company . '' as if on cue , two world-class pianists , polish-hungarian piotr anderszewski and french-born jean-yves thibaudet , are seated at the same table at a gala post-concert dinner held by far niente wine estate on a cloudless night in a circular arbor crowded with honeysuckle . thibaudet jumps up at one point to accompany violinist bell in manuel ponce 's `` estrellita , '' watched by composer marco tutino and cellist nina kotova . read about joshua bell 's recent win of the $ 75,000 fisher prize . `` we are located in a wonderful hotel , '' says conductor denève , the newlywed whose base of operations is glasgow where he is music director of the royal scottish national orchestra . `` wonderful swimming pool , actually it 's a great way to socialize and get to know more and more the fellow artists because usually you are engaged and just have one or two nights . '' thibaudet places a similar premium on these festivals ' sense of community for artists . `` when we have concerts , '' he says , `` we just come into town , we play and we leave . usually there wo n't be any other soloists , there 's only you . so we never get to meet each other during the year . '' and it appears that the napa community could n't be happier than to find these major concert and recording artists `` working the valley . '' in a kind of vine-roots , if not grassroots , effort , the wineries have jumped with endearing eagerness into what walker terms a `` friendly competition '' for whose after-concert gala can be the most opulent . they lay on rich dinners set at starlit tables , some by glowing pools , others on cricket-chirpy hilltops and still others under chandeliers hung high in some of the most honored wine-making facilities in the country . one of the venues for the festival this year has been the medieval-looking castello di amorosa , another the renovated lincoln theatre in yountville . wineries participating in special events around an intensely proud sponsorship of the festival have included far niente , the copelands ' bouchaine vineyards , darioush winery , clos pegase , robert mondavi winery , peju province winery , pine ridge winery and st. supéry vineyards and winery . many of these are festival-funding partners , joined by domaine chandon , blackbird vineyards , dalla valle vineyards , plumpjack winery , folio winemakers ' studio , gargiulo vineyards , swanson vineyards and copia , a nonprofit center of wine-making culture in the valley . the vintners , themselves , seem to enjoy the chance to mingle in the common interest of the festival and in the company of these artists they seem to be tying onto their hearts like vine tendrils in their fields . margrit mondavi is a welcome guest one evening at far niente , as are tatiana and gerret copeland of the bouchaine house . florence 's maria manetti farrow , whose ranging villa mille rose is an influential olive oil estate , seems to be everyone 's fondest table mate and every artist 's favorite dinner companion . resort partners include auberge du soleil , calistoga ranch , solage calistoga , the carneros inn and silverado resort . walker , in fact , estimates that the napa festival -- which with cortona and singapore is produced by the nonprofit del sole foundation for the arts and humanities -- could cost as much as $ 10 million to stage , if the many in-kind services provided by hoteliers , wineries and others were totaled in cash . the `` rehearsals '' for all this , if you will , took place in cortona , where wissman and charles letourneau , executive producer , have staged several years of festival events in what wissman likes to call `` a magical , fellini-esque feel . '' when he looked for a spot in the united states to base a sister festival , `` napa was the perfect place , '' close to the metropolitan pace of san francisco but removed enough to shelter artists and audiences in peace . wissman looks across a long , candlelit table amid shadowy great barrels of bouchaine wine . french conductor denève has tatiana copeland 's dinner guests in stitches with his tale of how he proposed to his new wife on the glass floor high atop the canada 's national tower in toronto -- `` my god , it was frightening !

343	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states imposed stiff sanctions against iran on thursday , targeting two iranian military groups and a number of iranian banks and people it accuses of backing nuclear proliferation and terror-related activities . `` what this means is that no u.s. citizen or private organization will be allowed to engage in financial transactions with these persons and entities , '' secretary of state condoleezza rice said . `` in addition , any assets that these designees have under u.s. jurisdiction will be immediately frozen . '' rice and treasury secretary henry paulson made the announcement in a brief appearance before reporters on thursday morning . rice accused iran of `` pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon ; building dangerous ballistic missiles ; supporting shia militants in iraq and terrorists in iraq , afghanistan , lebanon and the palestinian territories ; and denying the existence of a fellow member of the united nations , threatening to wipe israel off the map . '' watch rice tell why sanctions are being imposed '' `` many of the iranian regime 's most destabilizing policies are carried out by two of its agencies : the islamic revolutionary guard corps , or the irgc , and the quds force , an arm of the irgc , '' she said . she said the sanctions were being imposed `` because of the revolutionary guard 's support for proliferation and the quds force support for terrorism . '' the united states also designated three iranian state-owned banks for sanctions , two of them `` for their involvement in proliferation activities '' and the other `` as a terrorist financier , '' rice said . `` iran funnels hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the international financial system to terrorists , '' paulson said . `` iran 's banks aid this conduct using a range of deceptive financial practices intended to evade even the most stringent risk management controls .

'' how many times has that phrase been used ? it 's such a common phrase it 's as if what really happened gets glossed over : skin scraped off their bodies , fingernails ripped out , horrifying screams of pain before death . how many times have we reported death tolls from one horrific bombing or another and not been able to get across that these are lives that literally were blown apart ? no matter how hard we in the media try , iraq remains a nation filled with untold tragedies , the scope of which so often is overwhelming . and no matter how hard iraqis try to shield themselves and those they love from the horrors here , more often than not they fail . yet they keep fighting . see the sacrifices of iraq 's women '' nahla works at a radio station and is one of those women . she 's tall , slender , elegantly dressed and has a firm handshake . i look at her and it 's nearly impossible to imagine what she 's been through . `` this numbers game , you always think that you are exempt from the numbers , '' nahla tells me , referring to the daily death toll . `` you 're pained by them , but you are outside of them .

'' the police and security force is expected to be deployed to the balkan state ahead of an announcement of independence . `` this is the clearest signal that the eu could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , '' socrates said . according to cnn 's robin oakley in brussels , european leaders are trying to balance an obvious readiness to back kosovan independence with incentives to serbia , which is seeking membership of the eu . eu leaders are deeply conscious of their failure in the early 1990s to move early enough to prevent the bloodletting in the balkans over the break-up of the former yugoslavia , he said . although most eu leaders support serbia becoming a member state to boost stability in the balkans , french president nicholas sarkozy said that serbia 's membership is dependent on it recognizing kosovo 's independence and handing over war criminals . socrates confirmed to cnn that any fast-tracking of serbia into the eu could only be considered if it agreed to hand over ratko mladic , the bosnian serb general wanted at the the hague for suspected war crimes . two years of negotiations on the future status of kosovo ended in failure earlier this week , when talks mediated by europe , the united states and russia ended without an agreement . the disputed province is dear to the serbs , orthodox christians who regard it as serbian territory . but it is equally coveted by kosovo 's ethnic albanians , muslims who have a 90 percent majority . since 1999 the united nations has been running the province with nato peacekeepers , who still number 16,000 . oakley said the eu mission to kosovo would help to ease the handover from the u.n. to local authorities . e-mail to a friend .

355	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- investigators with bomb-making components in their luggage and on their person were able to pass through security checkpoints at 19 u.s. airports without detection , according to the government accountability office . passengers pass through security at o'hare international airport in chicago , illinois . gao officials are expected to testify about the investigation thursday before the house committee on oversight and government reform . the investigators reported that most of the time security officers followed transportation security administration policies and procedures , but investigators were able to take advantage of `` weaknesses in tsa procedures and other vulnerabilities . '' `` these weaknesses were identified based on a review of public information , '' the planned gao testimony says . investigators concluded that if they had attempted the same test at other airports , they would have evaded detection . but the gao did not detail the weaknesses because they `` are sensitive security information . '' the investigators obtained the bomb-making components at local stores and over the internet for less than $ 150 , according to testimony . watch a tester point out a tsa mistake '' the gao said its investigators also tested the devices that could be built with the components they smuggled and discovered that `` a terrorist using these devices could cause severe damage to an airplane and threaten the safety of passengers . '' the gao investigators devised two types of devices : an `` improvised explosive device '' made of a liquid explosive and a low-yield detonator , and an `` improvised incendiary device '' that could be created by combining commonly available products prohibited in carry-on luggage . the gao said it found the instructions for creating the devices `` using publicly available information , '' including internet searches . according to the testimony , a transportation security officer barred one of the investigators from bringing an unlabeled bottle of medicated shampoo through the checkpoint . but the security officer allowed a liquid component of the improvised explosive device to pass through undetected , although that item is prohibited by the tsa . in another test , the investigator put coins in his pockets to assure he would get a secondary inspection . but the officer , using a hand-wand and a pat-down , failed to detect any of the prohibited items the investigator was carrying . the gao said it had briefed the tsa on its findings `` to help them take corrective action . '' in testimony to be provided to the same congressional committee , tsa chief kip hawley defends the administration 's policies and procedures , saying that the screening checkpoints are but one of a `` multilayered approach to security . '' `` we recognize that , despite our efforts to make each layer as strong as possible , a concerted effort may target any one layer , '' according to the testimony . `` our ongoing success is a result of the tremendous power in the reinforced , multiple layers . truly , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts -- and together , they are formidable . '' hawley sketches for members of congress 19 security steps the tsa employs before , during and after checkpoint screening . `` each and every one of these 19 security layers is important and strong in its own right , '' he says . `` linked together , they are effective and daunting . '' although it would not discuss the specific nature of its recommendations , the gao said it recommended establishing special screening lines based on risk and passengers with special needs . the tsa should introduce more `` aggressive , visible and unpredictable '' measures to detect concealed items and develop new technology for screening at checkpoints . hawley 's said the tsa concurs with the gao 's recommendations and specifically discussed several `` new technology '' items that he said were `` greatly improving our effectiveness in detecting prohibited items . '' among the new technology , he said , were whole body imagers , bottled liquids scanners , hand-held explosives scanners and advanced technology x-rays . and , he added , `` our pursuit of new technology is not limited to what i described today . '' he also said the tsa is constantly conducting covert tests of the screening process , including detection of prohibited liquids and ieds . `` the nation 's aviation system remains secure , '' he said , `` but requires ongoing improvement and vigilance to stay ahead of the threat of terrorism .

358	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- as the war in iraq reaches its five-year anniversary this week , two of the world 's leading humanitarian groups issued extensive reports monday describing a crisis of huge proportions with little reason for hope . iraqi women mourn the death of their relative outside the morgue in the restive city of baquba , iraq , on march 12 . `` despite claims that the security situation has improved in recent months , the human rights situation is disastrous , '' amnesty international says in its report , titled `` carnage and despair : iraq five years on . '' in a summary of the report , amnesty writes that `` a climate of impunity has prevailed , the economy is in tatters and the refugee crisis '' keeps escalating . the international committee of the red cross , in a report titled `` iraq : no let-up in the humanitarian crisis , '' writes , `` despite limited improvements in security in some areas , armed violence is still having a disastrous impact . civilians continue to be killed in the hostilities . `` the injured often do not receive adequate medical care . millions of people have been forced to rely on insufficient supplies of poor-quality water as water and sewage systems suffer from a lack of maintenance and a shortage of engineers . '' the bush administration and many republican lawmakers , including presidential candidate sen. john mccain , have frequently praised successes in iraq in recent months , noting improvements in security in key areas . they attribute that in part to the buildup of u.s. troops in iraq ordered by president bush last year . vice president dick cheney described the five year u.s.-led invasion of iraq in a news conference monday during a visit to baghdad . `` this week marks the fifth anniversary , '' said cheney . `` it has been a difficult , challenging , but none the less successful endeavor . '' democrats , including presidential hopefuls hillary clinton and barack obama , have said the government failed to use the downturn in violence to achieve the steps it was supposed to make possible . sen. john mccain met with iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki on monday where he stressed the united states ' commitment to iraq . `` we recognize that al qaeda is on the run , but they are not defeated . al qaeda continues to pose a great threat to the security and very existence of iraq as a democracy . so we know there 's still a lot more work that needs to be done , '' he said . amnesty writes , `` key political benchmarks have yet to be realized . '' both amnesty and the red cross slam the iraqi government for failing to grapple with the critical needs of their populations . amnesty also says the iraqi government and the u.s.-led multi-national forces are responsible for some nightmarish circumstances . `` civilians are also at risk from multi-national forces and iraqi security forces , with many killed by excessive force and tens of thousands detained without charge or trial , '' amnesty writes in its summary . `` the death penalty was reintroduced in 2004 and hundreds of people have been sentenced to death . at least 33 people were executed in 2007 , many after unfair trials . '' in its report , amnesty says the iraqi government `` has failed to introduce practical measures to deal with the gross and serious human rights violations perpetrated by its security forces . there appears to be no serious willingness to investigate properly the many incidents of abuses , including killings of civilians , torture and rape , and to bring those responsible to justice . `` the government has also been unable to reign in shiite militia groups , such as the mehdi army , or to rid the interior ministry of death squads . the fact that the government is divided along sectarian lines has serious repercussions on its effectiveness and bodes ill for the future . '' the two reports cite a litany of concerns , including severe widespread poverty , a lack of food and water , and broken families left to scrounge for whatever they can find to get by . both reports describe a situation that shows no sign of clear improvement . amnesty also says conditions for women have worsened with the rise of fundamentalist religious groups . many women `` have been forced to wear islamic dress or targeted for abduction , rape or killing . '' the group notes a study by the world health organization in 2006/2007 that found 21 percent of iraqi women had experienced physical violence . amnesty adds that the `` predominantly kurdish region of northern iraq has been more stable with fewer acts of violence , and has seen growing economic prosperity and foreign investment . however , here too there continue to be serious human rights violations , including arrests for peaceful political dissent , torture , ill-treatment , the death penalty and the killing of women in so-called honor crimes .

360	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- solid support from registered democrats and women in new hampshire were crucial tuesday as sen. hillary clinton rebounded from her third-place finish in last week 's iowa caucuses . sen. hillary clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change washington . she narrowly defeated sen. barack obama in the new hampshire primary , with 39 percent of the vote to obama 's 37 . `` last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , '' the new york senator said after her victory . `` now let 's give america the kind of comeback that new hampshire has just given me . '' forty-three percent of self-styled independents said they voted for obama , and 31 percent said they backed clinton . independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled . addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called , obama congratulated clinton . but he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between clinton and himself . `` but the reason our campaign has always been different , the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago , is because it 's not just about what i will do as president , '' he said . `` it is also about what you , the people who love this country , the citizens of the united states of america , can do to change it . that 's what this election is all about . '' but clinton was ahead of obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered democrats . those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents . clinton also claimed the majority of women 's votes , according to the polling . that 's in contrast to last week 's iowa caucuses , in which obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from clinton . analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the clinton turnaround . `` if i had a single word , the word would be ` women , ' '' said cnn political analyst bill schneider . `` she got the women back . '' and schneider said the support of union voters that put clinton over the top . `` union voters have her a 10 point lead , '' he said . cnn projected former sen. john edwards to finish third . college graduates , who made up 29 percent of the electorate , opted narrowly for clinton -- 38 percent to obama 's 37 percent , according to the polling . those polled who called themselves very liberal , and moderate , went with clinton over obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split . pundits also were citing the role of former president bill clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to obama in new hampshire . the former president spent tuesday in hanover -- home to dartmouth college -- where obama had been expected to win handily . `` they dispatched him to the area that obama was surging , '' said cnn analyst donna brazille , who managed former vice president al gore 's campaign in 2000 . `` i think it had the effect of tamping down obama support and giving senator clinton a real reason to come back in this race . '' new hampshire was considered crucial to clinton 's campaign . if obama had been able to sweep iowa and new hampshire -- after months of clinton being considered the front-runner among democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries . `` age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting clinton , '' schneider said . `` sixty-seven percent of democratic primary voters are over the age of 40 , and they are breaking heavily for clinton over obama . '' over the past several days , clinton has trumpeted her experience , saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator . after losing to obama in last week 's iowa caucuses , it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be obama 's ability to electrify american voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process . the duel between the obama and clinton campaigns grew especially testy monday and tuesday . she said she had more experience than he , and was therefore more qualified . he accused her of representing the status quo of washington . and on the eve of the new hampshire primary , bill clinton criticized the media for not pressing obama more fully on iraq , and accused the illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in iraq . then , there was an issue unto itself -- hillary clinton 's almost-tears . clinton 's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter 's question about her health and appearance . pundits and voters alike questioned whether clinton 's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely , too cold . in front of the crowd of mostly female new hampshire voters , an admittedly fatigued clinton responded to a question by saying : `` this is very personal for me , it 's not just political , it 's -lsb- that -rsb- i see what 's happening , we have to reverse it . '' her voice broke , and she was then applauded by the crowd . polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters , according to cnn 's john king , but turned off some female voters . edwards was followed in votes by new mexico gov. bill richardson and ohio rep. dennis kucinich . e-mail to a friend .

'' art thieves do a simple risk versus reward evaluation , said corine wegener , associate curator of the minneapolis institute of arts . thieves know that `` even if they receive only a fraction of the work 's market value , the cash gained was at low risk of death or injury -- museums can be a relatively soft target , '' said wegener , who 's teaching a university of minnesota class this month on art theft . but it could be years -- or never -- before the thief sees even a small payoff . in 1990 , robbers took $ 300 million worth of certified masterpieces -- among them rembrandt 's `` storm on the sea of galilee '' and vermeer 's `` the concert '' -- from the isabella stewart gardner museum in boston , massachusetts . no one 's seen them since . on sunday , robbers made off with one of the biggest art hauls in european history , grabbing four paintings worth an estimated $ 163 million from the e.g. buehrle collection in zurich , switzerland . they took works by paul cezanne , edgar degas , claude monet and vincent van gogh . see what robbers grabbed in switzerland '' `` these paintings are extremely valuable on the open market , but they 'll never go onto the open market . so at the same time they 're both priceless and worthless , '' said charles hill , the former chief of scotland yard 's art and antiques unit . `` some thieves may buy into the myth that a wealthy but unscrupulous collector will contact them and offer to take the art off their hands , '' wegener said . `` when this does n't happen , the thieves often try to ransom the art back to the museum or the insurance company . '' one london art dealer , who said he has handled stolen works , told cnn on condition of anonymity that an insurance company would rather get art back at a fraction of its original price than pay the owner its insured value . watch how art thieves operate '' ransoming art to an insurance company through an intermediary adds `` up to 10 percent of the market value , which ... given the art market , is quite a lot of money , '' the dealer said . david vuillaume , secretary general of the swiss museums association , told time magazine that ransom may be what the thieves behind the swiss heist want . `` we are thinking that maybe in a week or two there will be a ransom demand . but we just have to wait and see , '' time quoted him as saying . the museum has offered $ 90,000 reward for information leading to their recovery , time reported . options for art thieves . julian radcliffe , chairman of the art loss register , which operates a database to help recover lost and stolen art , said ransom or reward are unlikely to bring results . `` it is very seldom that people have been able to undertake a ransom , '' he said . `` this gang might think that a reward has been offered , and that they 'll get the reward . '' but in fact , `` the reward wo n't be paid unless someone is arrested , or there is proper criminal intelligence , '' and that 's unlikely to happen , radcliffe said . he said the thieves may just be patient , willing to get their payoff decades later . or the art may move through an underground network , gradually increasing in value , before being slipped back onto the legitimate market . take spielberg . he bought `` schoolroom '' in an above-the-board transaction . `` usually , these pictures will change hands in the criminal underworld at a fraction -- 1 percent or less -- of their true market value , '' radcliffe said , before someone tries to get them back into the international market . in such an effort , the seller may hope the work has been forgotten over time or they may disguise it as a copy or student re-creation . `` they may try and sell them not as being by degas , but as being a copy , or school , or by a follower of one of the great artists . and that is the ways in which they try and get them on the market , '' radcliffe said . the original thieves rarely face justice , the fbi 's magness-gardiner said . `` the stolen items turn up years , sometimes decades , after the theft , '' she said . `` because a work of art does not require a title document in order to be transferred from one owner to another , a stolen object easily enters the legitimate stream of commerce . `` it is impossible to trace them back to the original thief in most cases . even if the original thief can be identified , there is also a statute of limitations on prosecution for theft , '' magness-gardiner said . what happens to stolen art ? even if the art is recovered , original owners may not get it back . while museum pieces are likely to go back to their collections , private owners may not be so lucky . `` russian schoolroom '' remains in spielberg 's possession while courts determine the rightful owner , a spokesman for the director said . but art stolen from a los angeles mansion and sold in sweden remains with its swedish purchasers , according to a case file posted on the web site of the los angeles police department 's art theft detail . even though the thief was caught , `` the swedish government refused to return the paintings , claiming that according to swedish law , the auction buyers had purchased the paintings in good faith , '' according to the web site . in the case of rockwell 's `` russian schoolroom , '' someone took it from a gallery in clayton , missouri , a st. louis suburb , in 1973 , according to an fbi synopsis of the case . in 2004 , the fbi 's art crime team found out that the piece had been for sale at a new york rockwell exhibition 15 years earlier and posted a picture and description of the painting on its art recovery web site . spielberg 's staff learned of the search and told the fbi that spielberg had it in his collection in los angeles . he had purchased it from a legitimate dealer in 1989 , an fbi press release said . the agency also determined the painting was auctioned in new orleans in 1988 , but it has yet to determine who took the painting or its whereabouts from 1973 to 1988 . whoever took `` russian schoolroom '' from the suburban st. louis gallery in 1973 , or the masterpieces from the boston museum 1980 , or the works lifted in zurich this week , should n't be mistaken for a high-society , tuxedo-wearing , `` thomas crown affair '' kind of thief , radcliffe said . `` these people are the worst sort of criminal . they are just like the criminals who traffic individuals or sell children , or murder . `` they are thoroughly unpleasant people . there is no romanticism in anyway that should be connected to it .

371	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it was an image that got the nation talking : two giggling young women in oversized sunglasses robbing a bank . the `` barbie bandits '' helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation 's bank robbery capital . here one of the so-called `` barbie bandits '' is captured on surveillance video at a surburban atlanta bank . atlanta 's fbi field division topped los angeles in reporting the most bank heists , with 350 for the 12 months ending september 30 , 2007 , according to the fbi , which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies . the los angeles area was no. 2 with 338 heists , followed by philadelphia with 316 . just thursday , two suspects overpowered a security guard at an atlanta , georgia , bank , took his gun , robbed the bank and fled with money in hand , police said . eventually , police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire . two more armed bank robberies took place in metro atlanta friday . the fbi says violent crime is up across the nation , especially in major metro areas like atlanta . so it 's no surprise atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies , fbi spokesman stephen emmett told cnn . watch hotlanta or heistlanta ? '' `` this goes hand in hand with those figures , '' emmett said . atlanta 's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor . a recent atlanta business chronicle article reported that metro atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of north carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region . see photos of bank heists in metro atlanta '' `` we would attribute a lot of that -lsb- bank robberies -rsb- to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area , '' emmett said . atlanta 's rise in bank heists comes just as los angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies . los angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year 's 338 , the fbi stats show . according to the fbi , its atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the `` barbie bandits '' and `` grandpa bandit '' robberies . the fbi says 122 of the heists were armed robberies , or robberies where a weapon was visibly used . emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as `` note jobs '' -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller . also factored into the total number of robberies were atm heists and a record nine armored car robberies . those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to emmett . `` anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he 's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture , that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement , '' he said . while emmett said there is no `` typical '' bank robber , he said he has seen some trends , most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions . he also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders . two recent high-profile cases in atlanta seem to confirm that . two women dubbed the `` barbie bandits '' were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a bank of america in the atlanta suburb of acworth . they both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems . recently apprehended 69-year-old bobby joe phillips , dubbed the `` grandpa bandit , '' is suspected to have robbed seven banks in tennessee and the atlanta area and had a criminal history . emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist . joe brannen , president of the georgia bankers association , agrees , saying `` the average is $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 . it 's not as big a payoff as most people think it is . '' with the holidays in full swing , authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash . `` i would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased -lsb- financial -rsb- pressures this time of year , '' said brannen . the fbi advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves , hats and sunglasses . but brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic . `` we 've chosen not to go there . here in atlanta , lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes . this is a free and open society , '' he said . he said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers , not bank robbers . brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank 's need for security . `` there is no good , magic solution . '' he says . emmett said as long as metro atlanta continues to grow , so will the number of bank robberies . `` this is something that is part of growth . we have more banks . we have more people . we 're a big city now .

'' but minallah issued an open letter on monday and released the doctors ' clinical notes to distance them from the government statement , and he also talked to cnn . in the letter , minallah said the doctors `` suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy , '' but that saud `` did not agree . '' he noted that under the law , police investigators have `` exclusive responsibility '' in deciding to have an autopsy . minallah told cnn that he was speaking out because the doctors at the hospital were `` threatened . '' `` they are government servants who can not speak ; i am not , '' he said . he did not elaborate on the threats against the doctors . he said the lack of an autopsy has created `` a perception that there is some kind of cover-up , though i might not believe in that theory . '' `` there is a state within the state , and that state within the state does not want itself to be held accountable , '' minallah said . cheema said the government had no objection to bhutto 's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it . her widower has said the family was against exhumation because it did not trust the government . minallah said the family could not have prevented an autopsy at the hospital without getting an order from a judge . the three-page medical report , which was signed by seven doctors , described bhutto 's head wound , but it did not conclude what caused it . it noted that x-ray images were made after she was declared dead . the wound was described as an irregular oval of about 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters above her right ear . `` sharp bones edges were felt in the wound , '' it read . `` no foreign body was felt in the wound .

378	macau , china -- pete sampras rolled back the years to upset current world number one roger federer in an exhibition match in macau on saturday . sampras enjoyed the spoils of victory in macau after two previous defeats to federer . federer had one the two previous clashes in an asian series in straight sets but was handed a 7-6 6-4 defeat in the finale . american ace sampras downplayed his victory , noting federer was coming off a long season and that he was helped by his big serve and the fast indoor carpet surface . he had only aimed to win one set during the three-match series . `` let 's not get carried away , '' he said at a news conference . sampras ruled out a comeback from retirement , telling the audience after the match , `` i had my time in the 90s . '' federer tried to put on a positive spin on the loss , saying he was n't embarrassed to lose to his idol , but still showed some disappointment . `` it 's been tough beating my idol the last two times . i 'm happy that he got me at least once , '' he said , but adding , `` i hope we can do it again in the future . i 'd like to get him back .

379	dubai -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a court in dubai sentenced two men wednesday to 15 years in prison for the rape and kidnapping of a 15-year-old french boy . veronique robert , mother of the 15-year-old french-swiss teen , speaking outside a court in dubai . the boy 's mother , veronique robert , was visibly upset after the sentence was read and promised to appeal . robert , a french journalist , brought the case to the media 's attention in recent months in an effort to shed light on what she deemed to be injustices in the pro-western emirate of dubai . robert said wednesday 's sentence was too lenient for a crime that she believes is tantamount to attempted murder because one of her son 's attackers was knowingly hiv-positive at the time of the rape . she refrained from asking the death penalty for her son 's attackers , but said she hoped the sentence would be much longer . a spokesman for the dubai government , habib al mulla , told cnn the sentence was in accordance with international standards and was not lenient . `` today 's verdict has proven that the system is efficient and is fair to all parties involved , '' al mulla said . the case began in july , when the two men , 36 and 18 , kidnapped and raped the french teenager at knifepoint . robert contacted french diplomats , who took up the allegations with dubai authorities . al mulla said police action was swift and arrests were made within 24 hours . but robert has said the case was botched from the start , beginning with her son 's examination by a doctor who said her son was gay . homosexuality in dubai is illegal , and the teen could have faced as much as a year in prison . robert 's son has since returned to france and was not in court for wednesday 's sentencing . robert has also said dubai authorities repeatedly concealed evidence -- confirmed in court papers -- that one of the attackers was hiv-positive . robert said her son , who is still awaiting test results to find out whether he has the virus , could have gotten treatment much sooner had they known . dubai authorities deny any evidence was concealed . the case has shed light on dubai 's attitudes toward rape and homosexuality , which some western observers have said is outdated . al mulla , however , said wednesday 's sentencing and the government 's handling of the case proves the country 's system works . `` it 's today 's verdict which proves that there is a system , '' al mulla said . `` the system is working properly . however , if there is any room for any improvement in the system , we 'll definitely look into it , consider it , and if there 's any room for improvement , we 'll implement it . '' the mother has already filed suit in courts in paris and geneva , switzerland seeking compensation from sheikh khalifa , president of the united arab emirates , and the prime minister and vice president of dubai , sheikh mohammed al maktoum . she is also suing others , including the dubai police chief . robert started a web site over the summer , boycottdubai.com , demanding better treatment for children who suffer sexual assault there . at a press conference last month , she proclaimed , `` we are here because i just would like first justice for my son ; and second for every girl and boy who was raped and even had no chance to speak . '' robert said she will drop all her pending cases if the government sets up rape clinics , recognizes the status of rape victims , and takes precautions after rape against sexually-transmitted diseases . in the wake of wednesday 's verdict , robert said a dubai government official told her the emirate plans to open its first rape clinic , which she said was a small victory . the government has not yet officially announced its plans to open such a facility . al mulla told cnn that dubai believes a reception center for rape victims is `` a good solution . '' `` we are considering it , '' he said , regarding robert 's request . `` we believe it 's good . it 's good for the victims , and it 's good for the whole system .

384	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush vetoed an expansion of the federally funded , state-run health insurance program for poor children for a second time wednesday , telling congress the bill `` moves our country 's health care system in the wrong direction . '' in his veto message , president bush calls on congress to extend funding for the current program . in his veto message , bush said the bill is almost a duplicate of the proposal he spiked in october . `` because the congress has chosen to send me an essentially identical bill that has the same problems as the flawed bill i previously vetoed , i must veto this legislation , too , '' he said in a statement released by the white house . the bill would have expanded the state children 's health insurance program by nearly $ 35 billion over five years , the same as the measure bush vetoed october 3 . track recent and historical presidential vetoes '' the president had proposed adding $ 5 billion to the program and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state-run program . democratic leaders said the new version addressed republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving schip benefits , capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program and preventing adults from receiving benefits . though the measure had strong bipartisan support , it fell short of the two-thirds majorities needed to override a presidential veto in the house and senate . house minority leader john boehner , r-ohio , said democrats were more interested in scoring political points with the veto than in reaching a compromise with republicans . `` we could have resolved the differences in his program in 10 minutes , if the majority had wanted to resolve the differences , '' boehner said . `` this has become a partisan political game . '' the program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who ca n't afford private insurance . democrats wanted to extend the program to another 4 million , paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes . `` what a sad day that the president would say that rather than insuring -lsb- millions of -rsb- children , ' i do n't want to raise the cigarette tax , ' '' said house speaker nancy pelosi . she called for a january 23 vote on whether to override the veto . meanwhile , bush called on congress to extend funding for the current program to keep the 6 million now covered on the rolls . e-mail to a friend .

386	santiago , chile -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- chile called home its ambassador in peru on monday , as a dispute flared over disputed maritime territory between the south american neighbors . they have bickered over the rich pacific coast fishing waters for years , and peru published a new map on sunday that pushes its bid to negotiate a new sea border . chile 's government protested the move and said it was calling home its ambassador in peru , cristian barros , for consultations . `` we feel that this type of publication -lrb- map -rrb- and this position certainly make more difficult a fluid bilateral relationship with the peruvian government , '' spokesman ricardo lagos weber said on monday . `` chile will continue to fully exercise its rights and competencies over chilean territory , '' he said . peruvian president alan garcia said in june his country would take chile to the international court at the hague to resolve the case . peru 's foreign minister , jose antonio garcia belaunde , sought to downplay the row . `` it is an absolutely common diplomatic practice in novel situations like this that garner attention that ambassadors are called -lrb- back to report -rrb- , '' he said . `` the channels of dialogue and communication must be kept open , and the countries must work toward a positive agenda , '' garcia belaunde said . the sea border , set in the 1950s , starts close to the land border and cuts due west across the ocean . but peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles -lrb- 37,900 sq km -rrb- of fishing waters . its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the pacific ocean . analysts say peru will have its day in court and the hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved , unless something happens to escalate the debate . `` the only thing that could happen , which would be very worrisome , would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty -lrb- in those waters -rrb- now that peru officially claims them . that would be a shame , '' said ricardo israel , a political analyst in chile . chile defeated peru in the 1879-1883 war of the pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor . the two countries have strong economic ties but relations are still rocky . the dispute over their sea border has bubbled anew over the past two years and comes in addition to less serious disputes over the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco , a grape liquor . peru and chile are the world 's top producers of fish meal , a cattle feed , and fishing is one of the engines of peru 's economy . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .

if you think you know it , shout it out . was it : a -rrb- 1997 , b -rrb- 1999 , c -rrb- 2001 or d -rrb- 2003 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! if you guessed c , you 've got the right tune . the popular portable players first made the scene in the fall of 2001 . that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! tech in the classroom . azuz : whether it 's an ipod , sony , samsung or zune , it seems like you ca n't go anywhere these days without seeing people plugged in to some type of mp3 player . and if you 're on a college campus , you might think students walking around with their ear buds in are listening to music . but do n't be fooled . they could just be studying up for class . -lrb- begin video clip -rrb- . azuz : walk around any college campus and those famous white earplugs seem to be everywhere . but sometimes the playlist is n't quite what you 'd expect . lectures on computer science instead of american idol . not so much sum 41 as history 101 . some teachers have used the audio ipod in their lessons , but at the georgia institute of technology , professor jim foley hopes to transfer his visual web lectures to the video ipod . professor foley , user interface design teacher : the students who did web lectures earned grades that were about 10 % better -- we did that three years ago . azuz : as mp3 players become essential parts of students ' lives , they have the potential to rival the laptop as learning tools in the classroom . with a graduate student 's help , foley records lectures before class , so that students can raise questions when they arrive . students from foley 's user interface design course say they find it valuable to review lectures when convenient . kathy pham , student in professor foley 's user interface design class : it takes 15 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other side of campus . and to be able just to download the mp3 to my ipod and just walk across campus , would be very beneficial . scott gilliland , student in professor foley 's user interface design class : a lot of people ca n't get to a full desktop computer whenever they need to listen to the lectures , and it 's nice to be able to take them with you . azuz : although students show enthusiasm towards mp3 players , there are limitations because they 're small . foley : the screen resolution is smaller and navigating between pages will be a little bit slower than on the computer because on the computer i just use the mouse . with the ipod i have to use the scrollwheel and scroll around . azuz : like the laptop , the mp3 player is a popular and revolutionary way to gather and disseminate information . regardless of what teachers decide to use , players and laptops will remain allies . besides , you need a laptop to operate an ipod and vice versa . -lrb- end video clip -rrb- . podcast promo . azuz : and if downloading lectures is n't enough , we 've got another cool thing you can do with an mp3 player : watch cnn student news ! that 's right , you can download our podcast at cnnstudentnews.com or at itunes . so you wo n't miss out on the news when you 're on the go . now and then . ramsay : with cell phones , thin is in . but you had to flex some muscle to handle its oversized ancestor . an ipod can hold your whole music library . but a vintage walkman let you jam out one cassette at a time . microchips keep getting smaller and smaller . but old school computers took up a lot more space . and game controllers have buttons for every possible move . but the retro version ? one button , one joystick , tons of fun . learning with technology . azuz : it 's not just slimmer cell phones and smaller computers . advances in technology are changing the world we live in all the time . and one of the places where those changes are taking place is schools . so we talked to some students and experts to hear what they have to say about teaching with tech . -lrb- begin video clip -rrb- . trina davis , president , international society for technology in education : we started off , when we were first starting to integrate technology , kind of at that basic level . matthew lewis , junior , greenside high school : we of course use laptops and computers . each teacher is assigned a laptop . and also , we have computer labs and a media center with computers inside . don knezek , ceo , international society for technology in education : certainly just dropping technology into a learning environment does n't necessarily improve it unless you are sure that the activities that you are doing align with the expectations that you have for learning . ammarah mahmoud , junior , salem high school : i think many careers today require for people to know how to use technology , so it 's important to learn that in school . knezek : so you ca n't convince me that a student without basic fundamental technology skills is on equal footing for employment . mahmoud : i do n't think schooling should be technology dependent , because i think that , at the same time , we should n't rely on something that does n't have a mind of its own . knezek : you can certainly abuse technology . you can abuse the printed word . you can abuse access to external resources . certainly if teachers and school leaders and parents use the same standards that they would use for any resource for technologies , then we 're in fine shape . lewis : i can see people in the future having something where you just scan , and all of your , you know , personal information comes up and everything about you can come up on a screen , and i think that 's really cool . davis : customization , very innovative , lots of gaming , lots of 3-dimensional spaces and just social spaces that feed on the needs of young learners . -lrb- end video clip -rrb- . goodbye . azuz : and that is the last word in this special edition of cnn student news . we 'll see you back here soon for our next summer show . and of course we thank you for watching everyone . i 'm carl azuz . e-mail to a friend .

389	algiers , algeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the united nations headquarters in algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building 's facade and leveled nearby u.n. offices . rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building . it was one of two suspected car bombs that struck algiers within 10 minutes of each other . the death toll is unclear : the official government count is at least 26 , but hospital sources in algiers told cnn affiliate bfm-tv that 76 people were killed in the two blasts . a statement from the united nations said 45 people were reported killed . algerian interior minister noureddine yazid zerhouni blamed a militant islamic group with ties to al qaeda for the attacks , which also targeted a building housing algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court . in a posting on an islamist web site , the group al qaeda islamic maghreb claimed responsibility . cnn could not immediately corroborate that claim , but the web site is known to carry messages , claims and videos from al qaeda and other militant groups . in the posting , the bombers were identified as sheikh ibrahim abu othman and abdel rahman abu abdel nasser al-asimi . it said two trucks were filled with `` no less than 800 kg -lrb- 1,763 pounds -rrb- of explosives . '' the group called the operation `` another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood , defending the wounded islamic nation and in defiance to the crusaders and their agents , the slaves of america and the sons of france . '' at least 10 u.n. staffers were among those killed , according to u.n. spokeswoman marie okabe . the offices of the un high commissioner for refugees -- located across the street from the u.n. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. -lrb- 3:30 a.m. et -rrb- tuesday . `` our offices are basically destroyed now , nothing works , '' unhcr spokesman ron redmond said from its geneva headquarters . watch his full interview . he said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped u.n. workers . `` it 's a very serious situation still with the u.n. in algiers , '' he said . in a strongly worded statement , u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon condemned what he called `` an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity 's highest ideals under the u.n. banner . '' `` the perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by algerian authorities and the international community , '' ban said in the written statement . he said he has sent senior advisers and other top u.n. officials to head to algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort . most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the constitutional council -- which oversees elections -- and supreme court in the algiers neighborhood of ben aknoun , according to the state-run algeria press agency . that blast struck a bus outside the targeted building , killing many of those on board , the news agency reported . one man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him . `` i saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me . i had to run away from the car , '' he said . zerhouni said the attack was the work of the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , the same group that took responsibility for an attack in april in downtown algiers that killed 33 people . that group also uses the name al qaeda islamic maghreb after merging with al qaeda earlier this year . it abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al qaeda . cnn international security correspondent paula newton said the merger combined the expertise of algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al qaeda in north africa , enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of algiers . she said the group 's goal is to destabilize countries like algeria , morocco and tunisia , which it sees as enemies of the islamic state . zerhouni said police interrogations of gspc members arrested in the wake of the april attack revealed that algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court were on a list of gspc targets . algeria , which has a population of 33 million , is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an islamist party was poised to win . tens of thousands of people died in the unrest . although the country has remained relatively peaceful , recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence . e-mail to a friend .

394	yellowstone national park , montana -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the gray wolf was officially removed from the endangered species act 's `` threatened '' list friday after three decades -- a decision that has stoked controversy among environmentalists and ranchers . federal officials estimate there are 1,500 gray wolves in yellowstone national park . it means the wolves can be shot and killed once they step out of yellowstone national park as soon as the affected states establish a hunting season . however , state fish and wildlife officials can shoot the animals whenever they deem the wolves to be a problem . the government delisted the wolves -- which were eliminated from yellowstone decades ago before being reintroduced in the 1990s -- because they are now thriving in the park that is dominated by bison , elk and bighorn sheep . `` they 're back here in the northern rockies ; they 're back here in yellowstone , '' said doug smith , a biologist for the national park service in yellowstone . `` that 's something to celebrate given their history of human hatred . '' but not everyone is happy about the animal being removed from the endangered list . conservationists believe hundreds of gray wolves straying from yellowstone in search of prey could soon be killed by hunters and ranchers . watch rancher say no wolf is `` sacred '' '' `` we 're not ready to pop the champagne corks and have a party , '' said doug honnold , the managing attorney for earthjustice , a non-profit environmental law firm based in oakland , california , that has threatened to sue the government . `` my biggest fear is we 're going to go backwards instead of forwards . '' it would n't be the first time . in the early 20th century , wolves were the targets of a massive government extermination campaign . `` it 's harder to find an animal more persecuted than wolves . ... we did wolf extermination with a vengeance , '' said smith . but attitudes began to change in the 1980s . elk and bison populations increased dramatically because there was no natural predator to keep their numbers in check . in 1995 , smith led a team to bring wolves back to the rocky mountain landscape . they transplanted dozens of wolves to yellowstone from canada . see photos of yellowstone 's animals '' the project has been regarded as an overwhelming success . there are now more than 1,500 wolves across wyoming , idaho and montana , according to the government . that number convinced federal wildlife officials to remove them from the endangered species list . federal officials require each of the three states to maintain a population of 100 wolves , meaning a total of 300 wolves across all three states . the states have actually pledged to keep the population higher than that , at a rate of 150 wolves per state . `` we did a thorough analysis , '' said ed bangs , the wolf recovery coordinator for the u.s. fish and wildlife service . `` the consensus -lsb- for recovery -rsb- is a population of 300 wolves and 30 breeding pairs . '' he added , `` the wolf population is fully recovered . we have more wolves than we ever predicted and we have fewer problems than we ever predicted . '' earthjustice says that 's not nearly enough to ensure a viable population and they want to stop the delisting . `` we 're going to have hundreds of wolves die needlessly , '' said honnold . but many ranchers in the region just do n't understand the fuss about the animals . they have complained for years that the wolves eat their livestock . `` there 's nothing about a wolf that 's sacred , '' said bruce malcolm , a cattle rancher and republican member of montana 's house of representatives . he said he 's lost nearly two dozen cows to the wolves in recent years . `` i would have preferred that they never came here , '' he said . if there 's a winner with the controversy , it 's yellowstone . the wolves have pushed up attendance by more than a 100,000 visitors per year , according to a park study . smith , who has dedicated his life to the wolves , is philosophical about the debate . `` no one says living with wolves is easy , '' said smith . `` living with wolves is a compromise .

396	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the dalai lama friday rejected a series of allegations from the chinese government , saying he does not seek the separation of tibet and has no desire to `` sabotage '' the olympic games . chinese authorities have blamed followers of the dalai lama for instigating the unrest that has swept tibet . issuing a statement while traveling in new delhi , india , the spiritual leader of tibetan buddhists called on china `` to exercise wisdom and to initiate a meaningful dialogue with the tibetan people . '' beijing has blamed the dalai lama and his followers for violence that erupted amid protests for tibetan independence earlier this month , but china has drawn international criticism for its crackdown on the protests that began peacefully . president bush said friday he `` urged restraint '' during a phone conversation with chinese president hu jintao earlier this week , and noted `` that it 's in his country 's interest '' for the government to have representatives `` sit down again with representatives of the dalai lama .

'' the protests -- which began on the 49th anniversary of a failed tibetan uprising -- have threatened to overshadow beijing 's role as host of the summer olympic games in august . in his statement , the dalai lama complained the chinese state-run media 's coverage `` of the recent events in tibet , using deceit and distorted images , could sow the seeds of racial tension with unpredictable long-term consequences . this is of grave concern to me . '' china 's state-run media , however , have accused some western news agencies -- including cnn -- of distorting coverage of the riots to make china look bad and the protesters look like innocent victims . a headline friday on the english web site of china 's official xinhua news agency read '' ` anti-cnn ' web site reflects chinese people 's condemnation .

399	havana , cuba -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- cuban president raul castro is taking over leadership of a country whose government believes its citizens are not working hard enough . raul castro was chosen sunday to take over cuba 's presidency from his brother , fidel castro . the state-run newspaper recently ran an article headlined `` work : option or necessity ? '' the writer pointed out that , judging by the number of people in the streets during the day , many cubans do n't seem to be on the job . they have few motivations to buckle down : salaries average about $ 15 per month on the island , and cubans get monthly food rations even if they do n't work . watch a report on the realities in cuba '' `` there is a strong desire to protect and to gradually increase the incomes and savings of the population , particularly of those least favored , '' said raul castro , 76 . the black market is so widespread that cubans have coined a special term for breaking the law to make ends meet : `` resolver '' -- literally , `` to resolve . '' see cuba through i-reporters ' eyes '' the new president , who took the reins of power sunday from his ailing brother , fidel , 81 , has said the country must become more productive . `` the country 's priority will be to meet the basic needs of the population , both material and spiritual , based on the sustained strengthening of the national economy and its productive basis without which , i 'll say it again , development would be impossible , '' raul castro said in a speech sunday . cubans , too , are calling for reforms , though not all of them related to productivity . in a recent video that has made the rounds on the internet , a student poses tough questions to the president of cuba 's national assembly , asking why cubans can not travel freely to resorts -- a practice derided by critics as `` tourist apartheid . '' though such a public display of discontent is rare , the video echoed sentiments often voiced in private for years , particularly since the fall of the soviet empire in 1991 and , with it , the loss of billions of dollars in subsidies . cuban officials counter that cubans are not granted access to the nation 's most luxurious spots because they do not have the foreign exchange brought by the tourists and needed to run the country 's social programs , such as free health care and education . with a new president steering the island nation for the first time in 49 years , some cubans have allowed their expectations to rise . `` i think those expectations are really very large indeed and it 'll be the achilles heel , potentially , of this new government if it does n't attack them with some vigor , '' said hal klepak , a professor of history and warfare studies at the royal military college of canada in kingston , ontario . indeed , castro has promised to move within a few weeks to improve efficiency by cutting some of the red tape that can frustrate the most fervent of revolutionaries . but wayne s. smith , a senior fellow at the center for international policy in washington and chief of the u.s. interests section in havana from 1979 to 1982 , predicted sunday in an editorial in the atlanta journal-constitution that raul castro will not break strongly from his brother 's policies . `` rather , we will see a peaceful transition and the existing system remain largely intact , '' smith predicted . still , changes are inevitable , he said . `` raul castro has called for a nationwide debate on the country 's economic future and for cubans to propose reforms in group discussions . `` he has also called for new proposals to raise productivity , including discussion of more private ownership of land . the cuban people want change , want reforms that will bring about a better way of life . '' smith credited the younger castro 's leadership over the past 1 1/2 years , while serving as acting president , with having already resulted in `` a greater openness , and open criticism of certain government programs . '' but the degree of change remains uncertain , as does the possibility that `` even from the shadow fidel will try to discourage reforms , '' he said , adding `` the prognosis , nonetheless , is hopeful . '' see a timeline of castro 's rise to power '' the u.s. government 's former man in havana recommended current politicians exert pressure on the island with a light touch . `` we could accomplish far more by reducing tensions and beginning a meaningful dialogue , '' he said . `` raul castro has several times suggested such a dialogue . why not take him up on it ? we have disagreements , yes , but how do we resolve them without talking ?

401	-lrb- aol autos -rrb- -- do you live in one of the nation 's worst cities for road rage ? if you live in a major metropolitan area on either coast , chances are you do . if you live in the midwest or northwest , odds are that you do n't . miami ranks as the worst city for most aggressive drivers for the second straight year in a nationwide study of driver habits followed by new york , boston , los angeles and washington . but if road rage is a `` cultural phenomenon '' as one of our experts suggests , how best do we go about combating driver frustration across the nation ? traffic black spots . the nation 's roads are peppered with traffic black spots , junctions where car snarls elicit road rage in even the most mild-mannered drivers . southern california has the san diego -lrb- i-405 -rrb- freeway , and the nation 's busiest junction , where u.s. 101 meets it to the north of los angeles . miami and the east coast have i-95 , which snakes from the world 's busiest cruise port up to maine . the district of columbia and the beltway are infamous for gridlock . i 've spent three very nervous hours getting to chicago 's o'hare airport from the city center -lrb- before missing my flight -rrb- . traffic by definition is worst in major metropolitan areas -- if your farming community is gridlocked , you 'd better be grousing at your local council meetings -- but it is the increase in traffic that leads many to suggest it 's just going to get worse . traffic levels are rising seemingly as fast as home foreclosures in los angeles and miami . in these areas , it 's not only the rise in number of drivers , but the rising age of drivers . aaa points out that seniors are the fastest growing demographic in the u.s. . that suggests drivers should adjust their habits accordingly . aaa has launched its lifelong safe mobility campaign to help seniors adjust to more crowded roads and perhaps more aggressive drivers . the facts and remedy . when the aaa foundation for traffic safety studied more than 10,000 incidents of road rage and violent aggressive driving committed in the 1990s , it found that at least 218 people were killed and another 12,610 injured when drivers got angry . many of these aggressors are males aged 18 to 26 . the aaa web site offers a three-step plan to avoid becoming the victim of aggressive driving : . • the first tip is `` do n't offend , '' which includes cutting off other drivers , driving slowly in the left lane , tailgating and gesturing to other drivers . • the agency then warns to `` not engage , '' which advises steering clear of trouble , not making eye contact and getting help , by calling 911 , in the event of experiencing dangerous , aggressive driving . it then asks at-risk drivers to `` adjust their attitude , '' which involves `` forgetting winning '' -lrb- for the drivers to whom driving is a darwinian survival of the fittest -rrb- , or putting themselves in the other drivers ' shoes . • finally , they recommend that , if you think you have a road rage problem , seek professional help . other people 's actions . so the wife and i were looking for sofas . it was a sunday morning and , with me behind the wheel , we were dawdling around quiet streets trying to find one of those seemingly ubiquitous furniture warehouses . soon , the wife pointed one out but we were almost past it . i hit the brakes and quickly pulled in , then realized that a mercedes m-class had pulled in right behind me . a large , squat tattooed guy jumped out and started shouting , about 10 feet from my car . `` i have children in the car , i had to slam on the brakes , -lsb- how dare -rsb- you brake so quickly , '' he said , getting real mean . i appreciated i 'd probably braked quickly and that it was bad driving on my part . however , as his tirade continued , i very calmly asked why he was setting such a bad example for his young children by following another driver off the road , then shouting and swearing . the man continued his harangue before climbing back into his vehicle and driving away . the next time you 're fulminating in your front seat about another 's aggressive driving , remember that your driving will almost inevitably elicit the same response in someone else . and do n't swear in front of your kids or set a bad example for them . ` cultural phenomenon ' dr. leon james is a professor of psychology at the university of hawaii and web master of drdriving.org . he is also the co-author of `` road rage and aggressive driving '' with this wife , diane nahl . james began studying driving psychology about 20 years ago after his wife told him her mother thought he took turns too fast . over a period of self-study , he said he was amazed by the mistakes he made and the aggressive thoughts he experienced toward other drivers . he recorded them via his `` speakaloud '' method . using his method on students , he discovered that road rage is a `` cultural phenomenon . '' `` we call the back seat of the car the ` road rage nursery ' , where -lsb- young children -rsb- pick up all the driver 's bad habits , '' james said . `` it 's a cultural temper tantrum . '' james said `` local norms '' can play a part . for example , florida drivers yell at each other more than in california , where verbal interplay can be interpreted as road rage in a criminal court . but , in the main , it 's `` drivers trying to deal with their emotions in stressful situations . '' james said that , in his studies , an awareness gap exists in aggressive drivers : when asked about drivers ' habits , respondents suggested that about 85 percent of other drivers drove aggressively , while just 35 percent said they themselves drove aggressively . if you feel your blood boiling frequently behind the wheel , classes like james ' are sprouting all over the nation . addressing road rage . in an ideal world , an increase in drivers would automatically be met by an improvement in infrastructure , and fewer road-rage-inducing distractions . another utopian ideal is for everyone else to drive more considerately . one look at our nation 's crumbling roads tells us that this fantasyland clearly does n't exist . instead of looking outside your car at road conditions or the habits of other drivers , the answer to aggressive driving , most likely , lies within the confines of your own cabin . e-mail to a friend .

404	cairo , egypt -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- omar bin laden has a message for his father , osama : `` find another way . '' omar bin laden says he last saw his father in 2000 when the son decided to leave al qaeda . the son of the most-wanted man in the world spoke sunday to cnn in a quiet , middle-class suburb about an hour outside cairo , egypt . omar bin laden , who works as a contractor , said he is talking publicly because he wants an end to the violence his father has inspired -- violence that has killed innocent civilians in a spate of attacks around the world , including those of september 11 , 2001 . `` i try and say to my father : ` try to find another way to help or find your goal . this bomb , this weapons , it 's not good to use it for anybody , ' '' he said in english learned in recent months from his british wife . he said that 's not just his own message , but one that a friend of his father 's and other muslims have expressed to him . `` they too say ... my father should change -lsb- his -rsb- way , '' he said . watch whether omar bin laden thinks his father will ever be caught '' he said he has n't spoken to his father since 2000 , when he walked away from an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan with his father 's blessings . he said he has no idea where his father is , but is confident he will never be caught because locals support him . asked if his father might be living along the afghan-pakistan border , he said , `` maybe , maybe not . '' `` either way , the people there are different , '' he said . `` they do n't care about the government . '' now , he and his wife are preparing to launch a movement far different from the one his father , osama bin laden , launched . they are pursuing a movement for peace . at first glance , omar bin laden appears to have little in common with the man who has eluded international efforts to find him . the 26-year-old 's hair is bound in neat braids , he drives a jeep and is married to a british national twice his age . but the physical resemblance quickly sinks in , even without the long beard his father favors . it is a resemblance he does n't avoid . `` being osama 's son , i do n't hide it . i do n't hide my name , '' he said . `` i am proud by my name , but if you have a name like mine you will find people run away from you , are afraid of you . '' he said he does n't consider his father to be a terrorist . when his father was fighting the soviets , washington considered him a hero , he said . `` before they call it war ; now they call it terrorism , '' he said . he said his father believes his duty is to protect muslims from attack . `` he believes this is his job -- to help the people , '' he said . `` i do n't think my father is a terrorist because history tells you he 's not . '' however , omar bin laden -- who was 14 when he began training in al qaeda camps -- said he differs greatly with his father over the killing of civilians . was 9/11 a just attack ? `` i do n't think 9/11 was right personally , but it happened , '' he said . `` i do n't think ... -lsb- the war -rsb- in vietnam was right . i do n't think what 's going on in palestine is right . i do n't think what 's going on in iraq is right . `` if we make what is right and not right , we will make a very big list , '' he said . he said he left al qaeda because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians . he said his father did not try to dissuade him from leaving al qaeda . `` i told him i was going , and wanted to try life and see what it was like outside because , from a young age i was with my father , and i only saw and heard my father and his friends . my father told me , ` if this is what your choice -- your decision -- is , what can i tell you ? i like you to be with me , but this is your decision . ' '' so father and son went their separate ways . but there has been no running from the bin laden name , not after the events of september 11 . on that day , omar bin laden was in saudi arabia , where 15 of the 19 hijackers were from . asked if , upon learning of the news , he knew his father had been behind it , he replied , `` yeah , maybe . '' he said he felt sadness for those killed . `` i do n't think 9/11 was right personally , '' he said . `` i do n't agree with 9/11 or with any war where only civilians are dying . '' asked why he did not protest more strongly his father 's role in the killing of civilians , he said it is up to the religious clerics close to his father to tell osama bin laden to change tactics in the name of islam . and even if that most unlikely scenario were to occur , he said , al qaeda would not stop . `` my father does n't have the power to stop the movement at this moment . '' sitting by his side throughout the hour-and-a-half interview was his wife , zaina . the two are organizing a multi-month horserace through north africa in the name of peace , set to kick off this year . but getting sponsors to line up behind the name bin laden has been difficult . `` it would probably have been easier to do a race without having omar 's name , but then the race would just be a race , it would n't be a race for peace , '' his wife said . omar bin laden said his relationship with his father was limited . he is the fourth of 11 children born to his father 's first wife , and he is one of 19 children osama bin laden has fathered . `` most of the time he busy , so busy , all the day he 's busy -lsb- with -rsb- his friends . he was working a lot . '' omar bin laden is now undertaking perhaps an impossible task : trying to rebrand the name they share . but he said he is not looking for approval from his father . `` my life , i take care of my life , '' he said . `` my father he take care of his life .

405	washington -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- the democratic-led congress yielded to president bush on saturday and approved legislation to temporarily expand government 's power to conduct electronic surveillance without a court order in tracking foreign suspects . president bush demanded congress expand his surveillance authority before leaving for vacation . civil liberties groups charged the measure would create a broad net that would sweep up law-abiding u.s. citizens . but the house of representatives gave its concurrence to the bill , 227-183 , a day after it won senate approval , 60-28 . the action came amid warnings of possible attacks on the united states . `` after months of prodding by house republicans , congress has finally closed the terrorist loophole in our surveillance law -- and america will be the safer for it , '' declared house minority leader john boehner , an ohio republican . `` we think it is not the bill that ought to pass , '' said house majority leader steny hoyer . but he conceded he and fellow democrats were unable to stop the measure in this national security showdown with the white house . `` protecting america is our most solemn obligation , '' bush said earlier in the day in urging congress to send him the bill so he could sign it into law . watch kelli arena 's report on what some call an intelligence gap '' the measure would authorize the national security agency to intercept without a court order communications between people in the united states and foreign targets overseas . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
406	-lrb- aol autos -rrb- -- okay , you 've decided what model of car you want to buy . and you know , more or less , how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford . you 've kicked tires , talked to salesmen , taken a few shiny new numbers for a test-drive and you 're ready to make the deal . if you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections . except , you 're not quite done . you still need to decide whether to buy any of those `` extras '' that your salesperson will always suggest . some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding . others ... maybe not so much . the list of `` extras '' offered by most dealers , may include paint sealant , fabric protection/leather care , extended warranties , extended ` one price ' service contracts , rust/underbody coatings and anti-theft systems , to mention a few . we wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without . to get to the bottom of it , we thought we would consult an expert -- david bennett , manager of automotive programs for aaa . as it turns out , like most things in life , the answer often just comes down to what 's best for you , depending on your own situation , budget or locale . let 's address these add-ons one by one : . paint sealant . `` i think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days , so in most cases you probably do n't need that anymore , '' said bennett , who offered one caveat . `` but that can depend on what part of the country you live in -- what the climate is , whether you get a lot of snow and ice , and what the road crews put down on the road -- whether it is salt , or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint . but generally , as long as you keep your car washed , and wash that salt off of it , and get it waxed regularly , that paint should last without getting the ` add-on ' sealer at the dealership . also , if you get a chip or a ding , get it fixed so the rust does n't get a chance to set in and spread . '' fabric / leather protection . these extras are fairly self-explanatory -- the dealer `` treats '' the upholstered or leather seating with a `` protection '' product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks . `` this can be a good purchase , but the first question you should ask before buying it is , ` what kind of lifestyle do i lead ? ' suggests bennett . `` do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things ? or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults ? '' do you eat in the car with some regularity ? if so , and you 're just too darn messy for your own good , a stain protection might be a good way to go . `` also , look at exclusions in the plan , '' advises bennett . `` if you 're a smoker , and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes , and you 're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short , that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion . each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different , and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase , because it might not be a good one for you . '' if you want to save some cash , one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner . to remove spots from a leather seat , use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth . if the spot still remains , let it sit for a few hours . repeat , as they say , if necessary . it 's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance . rustproofing . this is when the dealership applies various rust-inhibiting chemicals , waxes or sealers to the vehicle 's undercarriage . it can also be applied to other rust-prone areas . rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years . keep in mind that some guarantees require annual `` checkups '' to re-apply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged . `` i do n't think this is necessary in most cases , '' opines bennett . `` the way most vehicles are constructed today , they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north , where they get a lot of snow . '' lojack car security system / anti-theft systems : . the folks at lojack car security systems report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the u.s. using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle . but if you want to go the more high-tech `` tracking '' route , using a security system like lojack may give you more peace of mind . the lojack system , includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle . the system uses a code that is tied into the vehicle identification number -lrb- vin -rrb- . then , when you report that your car has been stolen , the state police crime computer can match code against the state vin database . this automatically activates the lojack system in the vehicle -- emitting an inaudible signal . then , police cruisers and aviation units that have the lojack tracking system can identify the vehicle 's location , track it and recover it . lojack claims that over 200,000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system , with over 100,000 of those in the u.s. `` whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors . if you live in a high-crime area , a system like this could provide you with peace of mind , '' advises bennett . `` but even if you live in a safe , low-crime district , your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage , '' he notes . one caveat : some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen , especially if it has been seriously vandalized , or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems . another thing to consider is that owners of gm vehicles that come with its patented onstar system , probably wo n't need a theft tracking program , says bennett . `` because the system allows onstar operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen . so if you buy a gm car with the onstar system , you may want to pass on a lojack or similar tracking system . '' extended warranties . `` this really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle , because most of these extended warranty plans do n't kick in until the manufacturer 's warranty expires , '' advises bennett . `` and these days , those manufacturers warranties are three or five years , sometimes longer . `` so if you plan on selling the car after three or five years , it probably does n't make sense to buy the extended warranty . '' some warranties offer transferable policies , which let you `` sell '' the warranty along with the vehicle . others allow you to `` return '' the warranty for a pro-rated refund . bennett also explains that not all warranties are created equal . `` they usually have three levels of warranties : a basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain , for example ; while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed -- or an ` exclusionary ' extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed . at the top end , the best warranty just covers everything , but that is also the most expensive . '' bennett gives an example of one manufacturers warranty . `` for a 2007 buick , the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain coverage , and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100,000 miles . in fact , that 's the same warranty gm offers on their chevy and cadillac brands . '' `` that 's a pretty good warranty , so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less , the extended warranty is probably money you do n't need to spend . '' e-mail to a friend .

408	greencreek , idaho -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it was just 2 1/2 years ago when elaine sonnen found out that her 16-year-old son , richard , had been planning a columbine-style attack at his high school . richard sonnen spent 16 months in mental health institutions after plotting to kill his high school classmates . it would be a fitting payback to his high school classmates who richard said relentlessly bullied him . `` i always wanted to get back at them , '' richard sonnen said of his classmates . `` i always wanted to strangle them . ... i was always mad . i was always angry and i would come home and cry to mom and dad . '' both richard and elaine sonnen spoke to cnn at the 45-acre family farm . unlike columbine and recent school shootings at northern illinois university and virginia tech , elaine sonnen did see the warning signs in her son and was able to stop him . elaine and her husband , tom , adopted richard from a bulgarian orphanage when he was just 4 1/2 years old . `` i mean , we just loved him , and he was just a big sparkle of life , '' she said . but only a few months after they brought him home , they began to see another side of their son . he was angry and unpredictable . elaine sonnen says that at age 6 , richard told her he wanted to kill her . she said he would shake with anger to the point that he 'd scream at her , telling her he wanted to destroy her . `` people thought he was just the greatest kid in the world . very polite , well-mannered , caring , '' elaine sonnen remembered . `` at home , he could be anywhere from just a really helpful kid to a monster . a terrifying monster . '' mother says son had ` two ' personalities '' in junior high , he said , `` evil '' classmates started picking on him . boys and girls , he said , bullied him until he could n't take it anymore . `` i always wanted to get revenge , '' he said . by the eighth grade , richard was put on anti-psychotic medications . he had been diagnosed as bipolar and was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and other disorders . in 1999 , when the columbine shootings happened , the sonnens feared that richard might do the same thing one day . `` we stopped and looked at each other and said , ` this could be richard ; some day this could be him , ' '' elaine sonnen said . years later , during his junior year in high school , they were right . fed up with the bullies , richard says , he felt like an outcast and started looking for a way to get even . secretly , he began reading books about columbine in his school library . the shooters , eric harris and dylan klebold , became his heroes . `` they planned it out so perfectly and so meticulously ... that i just , wow , you know , '' he said . `` they 're my gods . '' watch a preview of `` campus rage '' '' he even created a hit list of the classmates he planned to kill at prairie high school in cottonwood , idaho . `` my plan was to set around bombs around the school . ... i analyzed a lot of where everybody sat and where everybody did their thing , '' he said . `` i had pinpoints of where i wanted to go , where i wanted to do it . '' harvard medical school psychologist william pollack , who consulted on a 2002 federal government study of school shootings , said it found that most school shooters often had feelings of anger , sadness and isolation as well as homicidal and suicidal thoughts . `` we see a young man who obviously is telling us how depressed he was , how angry he was and how much he looked up to people who we know are very disturbed and very dangerous , and how close he came to killing people , '' said pollack , who watched cnn 's interview with richard . elaine sonnen found out about her son 's plan during a conversation with him . she ordered him to write down the names of the eight students he wanted dead and then gave the list to his caseworker the next day . later , he added a teacher and his mother and sister to the hit list . she took immediate action and had her son committed to an idaho mental institution . over the next 16 months , he received treatment at several mental health facilities throughout idaho . `` there , i opened up . i felt better . i moved on with myself , '' richard said . `` they felt at that point ... they had done everything they could do for him , '' elaine sonnen added . `` he was doing great . he could make it on his own . they had no question . '' in january 2007 , after almost a year and a half in mental institutions , richard sonnen started a new life at lewis-clark state college in lewiston , idaho . he was taking a cocktail of three anti-psychotic drugs to help him function . '' -lsb- for -rsb- the first time in 12 years , i was able to hold my son , '' said elaine sonnen . `` so i knew he was on the road to be well . '' everything seemed to be looking up , but in april 2007 , three days after the virginia tech massacre , richard 's mother received a call from police . they told her richard had made about four threats to carry out shootings at lewis clark state college and lewiston high school . police told her richard planned to go home , get some guns and go back to school to pull off a sniper attack from a clock tower on the college 's campus , she said . police took him into protective custody and searched his apartment for clues . but , in the end , he was released because , authorities say , they did n't have enough evidence to charge him with a crime . richard said the whole incident was a big misunderstanding . he said he was telling people about his high school plot and never threatened his college or local high school . but his mother does n't believe his version of the story . `` no . i believe he made those threats , '' she said . `` i still believe it . '' richard , now 19 , signed an order banning him from campus for one year . today , he lives on his own in washington state . he 's still on medication but not seeing a psychiatrist . since he 's over the age of 18 , his mom ca n't force him to go . is elaine sonnen still afraid of her son ? `` yeah , at times , i 'm very afraid , '' she said . `` because he still has a lot of anger towards me . '' she said the signs are still there , and she fears what could happen if he ever stops taking his medicine . `` he 's not getting the help and the insight from a professional that could see the signs , '' she said . `` because as a person with a mental illness , you have skewed thinking . '' even though richard calls her the `` greatest person in the world , '' elaine sonnen protects the family by keeping an alarm on her son 's bedroom door when he comes home to visit . so why are richard sonnen and his mother , elaine , speaking out now ? in the wake of the northern illinois university and virginia tech shootings , richard wants young people experiencing the same symptoms he had to seek out help . his mother wants parents and authorities to listen for warning signs and to act fast and decisively . e-mail to a friend .

'' the report says the united states , the government of iraq and the international community are n't doing enough to address the daily problems faced by the 2.7 million internally displaced iraqis , who have fled homes in war-torn regions to other places in iraq . those people find themselves unemployed in their new locations and many times unable to access food and health care . `` as a result of the vacuum created by the failure of both the iraqi government and the international community to act in a timely and adequate manner , non-state actors play a major role in providing assistance to vulnerable iraqis , '' the report says . social services are being provided by `` militias of all denominations '' that want to build their groups , with muqtada al-sadr 's political movement using a hezbollah model to set itself up `` as the main service provider in the country . '' hezbollah , the lebanese shiite militant group labeled a terrorist group by the united states , has built a large base of support with its social service network . `` similarly , other shiite and sunni groups are gaining ground and support through the delivery of food , oil , electricity , clothes and money to the civilians living in their fiefdoms . `` not only do these militias now have a quasi-monopoly in the large-scale provision of assistance in iraq , they are also recruiting an increasing number of civilians to their militias -- including displaced iraqis , '' the report said . the report says al-sadr 's militia , the mehdi army , has resettled displaced iraqis `` free of charge in homes that belonged to sunnis . '' `` it provides stipends , food , heating oil , cooking oil and other non-food items to supplement the public distribution system rations which are still virtually impossible to transfer after displaced iraqis have moved to a new neighborhood , though it is easier for shiites to do so , '' the report says . refugees international visited a sadrist office in baghdad 's ur district and observed residents providing `` clothing , milk , oil , rice , sugar , clothes and fuel for heating and cooking when supplies are available . '' the sadrists also adjudicate legal disputes among citizens and give stipends to families of displaced people and slain or jailed mehdi army fighters . the report says sunni militias also play a similar role in helping needy and displaced sunnis , though there is less organized help . `` sunni militias also handle the distribution of key items such as heating gas . as sunnis in baghdad get virtually no electricity or other services from the government , they rely on local militias and warlords to secure their areas and manage what services they can obtain . '' the displaced have joined `` awakening '' groups -- the `` u.s.-backed militias '' dominated by sunnis . those groups provide security duties , such as guarding checkpoints , and many of them have been getting paychecks from the united states . the u.n. refugee agency says the displacement crisis caused by the war in iraq is the most significant in the middle east since the population changes that occurred during the 1948 creation of israel . along with the 2.7 million internally displaced people , there are more than 2 million iraqi refugees -- mostly in syria and jordan . the report slams the government of iraq as being `` unwilling '' and `` unable '' to address such humanitarian issues -- `` lacking both the capacity and the political will to use its important resources to address humanitarian needs . '' `` the little assistance provided by the government is perceived by most as being biased in favor of the shiite population , especially when it comes to the delivery of government services such as electricity or food ration cards from the public distribution system , '' the report says . the report adds that the `` international community has largely been in denial '' about the dire humanitarian situation in iraq . `` only recently has the united nations issued a common humanitarian appeal for iraq , recognizing the nature of the situation and the need for all agencies to step up and address humanitarian needs .

413	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- presidential candidates have been wooing voters in iowa for months , but who wins thursday may simply come down to where the caucus-goers live , where they meet and the weather . iowa is a mixed bag politically , and one of the most evenly divided states in the nation . but the candidates will likely watch two regions more closely than others . the central part of the state -- including industrial des moines -- is iowa 's most democratic area . western iowa , on the other hand , is home to the most republicans -- especially the rural counties in the northwest . the mississippi river city of davenport is expected to be one of the most significant battlegrounds , with linn county -- dominated by the university town of cedar rapids -- also attracting lots of attention from both parties . past iowa caucuses have been nail-biters for the candidates . democrat al gore won the state by a margin of just 0.3 percent in 2000 , while president bush carried it in 2004 by 0.7 percent . in fact , bush was the first gop presidential candidate to carry iowa in 20 years . important endorsement . the support of iowa 's largest newspaper , the des moines register , may also play a role in thursday 's caucuses . the paper 's presidential endorsements began in 1988 and have become a highly sought-after prize in iowa presidential politics . george w. bush was the register 's pick in 2000 and went on to win iowa , the gop nomination and the white house . republican presidential hopeful bob dole won the state in 1996 and 1988 after receiving the paper 's support . democratic candidates have n't had as much success with the register 's endorsement . john edwards finished in second place in iowa in 2004 , while paul simon was also a close second in 1988 . the paper endorsed sen. john mccain and sen. hillary clinton for their respective parties ' nominations . the candidates have to appeal to voters with strong opinions . on the republican side , 37 percent of participants in the 2000 iowa gop caucuses identified themselves as members of the religious right and 73 percent described themselves as conservatives . meanwhile , 56 percent of the participants in iowa 's 2004 democratic caucuses described themselves as either very or somewhat liberal . about 37 percent said they were moderates . the weather . iowans who take part in the caucuses must traditionally brave freezing temperatures and lots of snow . presidential candidates know bad weather may affect how many people turn out , but 1972 was the only time rough winter conditions played a role in the caucuses , according to drake university 's hugh winebrenner -- the nation 's leading expert on iowa caucus history . caucus-goers that year encountered heavy snowdrifts from a blizzard the previous day . temperatures dipped below zero across most of the state . the weather forced about one-fourth of iowa 's 99 counties to postpone their democratic caucuses up to two days after the scheduled date . the forecast for thursday is much better . temperatures will be in the 20s during the day and dip just below that as the caucuses begin , according to the des moines register . e-mail to a friend .

424	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- heather mills presented `` less than candid '' testimony about her life with former beatle paul mccartney during her divorce case and made more money during their marriage than before , according to a ruling released tuesday . mccartney 's lawyer fiona shackleton , left , pictured after it is alleged mills threw water over her . mills represented herself during the proceedings and was a `` less than impressive witness '' on her own behalf , judge hugh bennett wrote in awarding her # 24.3 million -lrb- $ 48.6 million -rrb- -- far less than the # 125 million she had sought from mccartney in the dissolution of their four-year marriage . `` having given in her favor every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under and in conducting her own case , i am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence , both written and oral , was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid , '' bennett wrote . mills emerged from the court monday angry about the judge 's treatment of her . she said the judge and attorneys acted like they were part of a `` club . '' blog : did mills pour water on mccartney 's lawyer ? a summary of bennett 's decision was released monday , but mills had sought to keep the full ruling under wraps . britain 's court of appeals ruled against her tuesday , and her lawyer , david rosen , said she accepted the decision . see a list of expensive celebrity divorces '' `` she as a mother has strived to protect her child and felt there were certain issues and matters in the judgment which affected that , '' rosen said . mills opposed the full ruling 's publication because it contained private details about her and her 4-year-old daughter with mccartney , beatrice . watch mills react to monday 's decision '' bennett had good things to say about mills in his judgment , commending her strength in the face of disability . mills lost her left leg below the knee in a 1993 traffic accident . but he discounted many of the arguments the former model made about her personal wealth before and after her 2002 marriage to mccartney . he ruled that mills earned far less before marriage than she claimed , and far more while married -- and at several points in his decision , he wrote that mills ' ideas about their marriage were `` make-belief . '' `` i find that , far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife 's career and charitable activities , he did the exact opposite , '' bennett wrote . mccartney , meanwhile , presented balanced evidence and was a consistent witness , he wrote . `` he expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation , if not anger , '' the judge wrote in a glimpse of the emotions aired behind closed doors . read the full ruling -lrb- . pdf file -- adobe acrobat required -rrb- . bennett found mills failed to produce financial records to back up statements about money she claimed to have in the bank before marriage , which she said amounted to more than # 2 million . in one instance , the judge pointed out mccartney 's company loaned mills money to buy a home in hove , england -- money that she would not have needed had she had such an amount in the bank . and bennett found that mills ' income actually improved during the marriage . in one year , she earned # 1 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- from a single modeling contract , he wrote . and he quoted mills ' 2002 book , `` a single step , '' in which she wrote that her charity work and public speaking roles had expanded `` to such an extent that it has left little time for anything else . '' `` she is a kindly person and is devoted to her charitable causes , '' the judge wrote . `` she has conducted her own case before me with a steely , yet courteous , determination . '' the couple met in 1999 , a year after the death of mccartney 's wife of 30 years , linda . the judge said mccartney continued to grieve for his late wife well into his marriage with mills -- and he suggested mills misrepresented her case because she had been star-struck . `` the wife for her part must have felt rather swept off her feet by a man as famous as the husband , '' he wrote . `` i think this may well have warped her perception leading her to indulge in make-belief . the objective facts simply do not support her case . '' bennett discounted mills ' claims that she was anything more than a loving and devoted wife in helping mccartney . `` the wife 's evidence that in some way she was the husband 's ` psychologist , ' even allowing for hyperbole , is typical of her make-belief , '' the judge wrote . mills and mccartney failed to agree on a divorce settlement in six days of hearings in february , leaving the judge to decide the terms . bennett 's 58-page decision concluded that # 24.3 million was enough for mills to live comfortably and take care of their daughter 's needs . mccartney had proposed a # 15.8 million settlement . the judgment included # 35,000 a year for beatrice , # 600,000 for mills and # 2.5 million for her to purchase property in london . e-mail to a friend .

'' `` it was my understanding that western precision was paying roughly $ 50,000 a week into the coffers of the church , '' former sect member richard holm said . `` it would have been close to $ 200,000 a month . '' holm said he helped build western precision . a court affidavit signed by a man whose father was the president of western precision makes similar allegations . `` during 2003 , the amount being sent to the storehouse and the flds was around $ 100,000 per month , '' john nielsen said in the october 26 , 2005 , affidavit . `` i have personal knowledge that checks sent to the flds church/warren jeffs by -lsb- western precision -rsb- are payable to the flds church and/or warren jeffs .

'' he added , `` however , dod is not aware of any criminal allegations against anyone managing the companies in question . '' bob maginnis , a retired army lieutenant colonel who now works with a contractor for the pentagon , said the department does background checks before signing contracts . `` the dod is obviously abiding by the law , and if we want them to look deeper and discriminate on religious or other activities we need to tell them . '' but he added , `` if there was a direct line between jeffs and this company , and his name was associated with a contract , then that should have come to attention of those that were bidding contract . '' it 's unclear whether jeffs ' name was on any contract , but other senior members of his church were managing the companies . what might taxpayers think of it all ? `` they 're just going to shake their head and say here 's another example of our tax money going down the drain to support this polygamist in texas who abuses children and women , '' maginnis said . `` they 'll be appalled and rightly so .

'' it 's based on the teachings of our teachers , clerics , especially what osama bin laden first said . '' `` because of america 's arrogance , many in the muslim world know , believe , it 's permissible to kill american soldiers . it 's halal ; it 's permitted , '' he said . the court declared jemaah islamiyah a terrorist organization monday and ordered it to pay 10 million rupiah -lrb- $ 1,088 -rrb- . around the same time dujana was captured last june , authorities also apprehended jemaah islamiyah 's leader , known simply as zarkasih . a verdict on his case is expected soon . last week , two other top jemaah islamiyah leaders -- dr. agus purwanto and abdur rohim -- were brought to indonesia following their arrest in malaysia . both are being investigated for their possible role in fomenting violence in poso . terrorism expert sidney jones says abdur rohim is believed to have replaced zarkasih as jemaah islamiyah leader . `` it is another major blow to jemaah islamiyah , but difficult to tell what the impact will be , '' jones told cnn via e-mail last week . `` it could embolden a more militant faction . -lsb- it -rsb- could also lead to some serious reassessment within the organization about its future .

431	-lrb- this old house -rrb- -- unless you 're a perfect caretaker of your lawn -lrb- and , really , who is ? -rrb- , prepare for another round in the turf wars this summer . you 'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions , of course . and an attack from the crabgrass . but you 'll face more stealthy opponents , too : root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown . `` if a lawn is neglected , or cared for in a hit-or-miss way , it gets weak , '' says this old house landscape contractor roger cook . `` and that 's when weeds , insects , or fungal diseases become a major problem . '' little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders . but as in most battles , the best defense is a strong offense : doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf . that means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week ; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots ; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height -lrb- ask your local garden center what 's best where you live -rrb- ; and fertilizing in spring and fall . so promise yourself -- and your turf -- you 'll do that this year . in the meantime , here 's how to conquer the most common turf problems you 're likely to confront this summer . fungal disease . symptoms : circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass ; or blades with tiny red threads . culprits : powdery mildew , brown patch , dollar spot , and fusarium patch ; or red thread . these fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf . solutions : though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection , if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard , look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions . for an organic fix , search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi . then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits : avoid excessive shade -lrb- prune back trees and large shrubs , if necessary -rrb- and too many applications of fertilizer , herbicides , or pesticides . carefully monitor your turf 's moisture intake and never water in the evening . weeds . symptoms : fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass . this old house : what type of grass is right for your yard . culprits : crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion , purslane , henbit , and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass has n't completely taken root . to check for compacted soil , stick a screwdriver into the ground ;

432	ip-455 press release 8 february 2008 the findings of a scotland yard inquiry into how mohtarma benazir bhutto died after being attacked during a political rally in rawalpindi were presented to the government of pakistan today . the bomb explodes near bhutto 's vehicle following a political rally in rawalpindi . the conclusions of the inquiry were outlined in a detailed report handed over to interim interior minister hamid nawaz by detective superintendent john macbrayne , accompanied by a senior official from the british high commission , during a meeting in islamabad . the text of the executive summary of the report is as follows : . on the 27th december 2007 , mohtarma benazir bhutto , the leader of the pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , died as a result of being attacked in rawalpindi , pakistan . following discussions between the prime minister and president musharraf , it was agreed that officers from the metropolitan police counter terrorism command -lrb- so15 -rrb- should support the investigation into ms bhutto 's death . the primary focus of the scotland yard team was to assist the pakistani authorities in establishing the cause and circumstances of ms bhutto 's death . the wider investigation to establish culpability has remained entirely a matter for the pakistani authorities . the so15 team was led by a detective superintendent senior investigating officer , and comprised two forensic experts , an expert in analysing and assessing video media and an experienced investigating officer . the team arrived in pakistan on 4th january 2008 and spent two and a half weeks conducting extensive enquiries . during the course of their work , the team were joined by other specialists from the united kingdom . the uk team were given extensive support and co-operation by the pakistani authorities , ms bhutto 's family , and senior officials from ms bhutto 's party . the task of establishing exactly what happened was complicated by the lack of an extended and detailed search of the crime scene , the absence of an autopsy , and the absence of recognised body recovery and victim identification processes . nevertheless , the evidence that is available is sufficient for reliable conclusions to be drawn . within the overall objective , a particular focus has been placed on establishing the actual cause of death , and whether there were one or more attackers in the immediate vicinity of ms bhutto . the cause of death . considerable reliance has been placed upon the x-rays taken at rawalpindi general hospital following ms bhutto 's death . given their importance , the x-rays have been independently verified as being of ms bhutto by comparison with her dental x-rays . additionally , a valuable insight was gained from the accounts given by the medical staff involved in her treatment , and from those members of ms bhutto 's family who washed her body before burial . ms bhutto 's only apparent injury was a major trauma to the right side of the head . the uk experts all exclude this injury being an entry or exit wound as a result of gunshot . the only x-ray records , taken after her death , were of ms bhutto 's head . however , the possibility of a bullet wound to her mid or lower trunk can reasonably be excluded . this is based upon the protection afforded by the armoured vehicle in which she was travelling at the time of the attack , and the accounts of her family and hospital staff who examined her . the limited x-ray material , the absence of a full post mortem examination and ct scan , have meant that the uk home office pathologist , dr nathaniel cary , who has been consulted in this case , is unable categorically to exclude the possibility of there being a gunshot wound to the upper trunk or neck . however when his findings are put alongside the accounts of those who had close contact with ms bhutto 's body , the available evidence suggests that there was no gunshot injury . importantly , dr cary excludes the possibility of a bullet to the neck or upper trunk as being a relevant factor in the actual cause of death , when set against the nature and extent of her head injury . in his report dr cary states : . • `` the only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bomb-blast . '' • `` in my opinion mohtarma benazir bhutto died as a result of a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of the bomb-blast and due to head impact somewhere in the escape hatch of the vehicle . '' given the severity of the injury to ms bhutto 's head , the prospect that she inadvertently hit her head whilst ducking down into the vehicle can be excluded as a reasonable possibility . high explosives of the type typically used in this sort of device , detonate at a velocity between 6000 and 9000 metres per second . this means that when considering the explosive quantities and distances involved , such an explosion would generate significantly more force than would be necessary to provoke the consequences as occurred in this case . it is also important to comment upon the construction of the vehicle . it was fitted with b6 grade armour and designed to withstand gunfire and bomb-blast . it is an unfortunate and misleading aspect of this case that the roof escape hatch has frequently been referred to as a sunroof . it is not . it is designed and intended to be used solely as a means of escape . it has a solid lip with a depth of 9cm . ms bhutto 's injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch . detailed analysis of the media footage provides supporting evidence . ms bhutto 's head did not completely disappear from view until 0.6 seconds before the blast . she can be seen moving forward and to the right as she ducked down into the vehicle . whilst her exact head position at the time of the detonation can never be ascertained , the overwhelming conclusion must be that she did not succeed in getting her head entirely below the lip of the escape hatch when the explosion occurred . how many people were involved in the immediate attack ? there has been speculation that two individuals were directly involved in the attack . the suggestion has been that one suspect fired shots , and a second detonated the bomb . all the available evidence points toward the person who fired shots and the person who detonated the explosives being one and the same person . • body parts from only one individual remain unidentified . expert opinion provides strong evidence that they originate from the suicide bomber . • analysis of the media footage places the gunman at the rear of the vehicle and looking down immediately before the explosion . the footage does not show the presence of any other potential bomber . • this footage when considered alongside the findings of the forensic explosive expert , that the bombing suspect was within 1 to 2 metres of the vehicle towards it rear and with no person or other obstruction between him and the vehicle , strongly suggests that the bomber and gunman were at the same position . it is virtually inconceivable that anyone who was where the gunman can clearly be seen on the media footage , could have survived the blast and escaped . the inevitable conclusion is that there was one attacker in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle in which ms bhutto was travelling . in essence , all the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shots before detonating an improvised explosive device . at the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of ms bhutto 's vehicle . the blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle , causing a severe and fatal head injury . john macbrayne qpm detective superintendent counter terrorism command 1st february 2008 e-mail to a friend .

435	tokyo , japan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. military in japan has charged a marine with rape and other violations of the uniform code of military justice in the alleged sexual assault of 14-year old girl in okinawa . a civic group member protests against hadnott near the u.s. embassy in tokyo on february 13 . staff sgt. tyrone luther hadnott , 38 , has been charged with the rape of a child under 16 , abusive sexual contact with a child , making a false official statement , adultery and kidnapping , the marines said friday . no dates for the court-martial have been set . in february , japanese authorities released hadnott after the girl dropped the allegations against him , but the marine corps conducted its own investigation to see if hadnott violated codes of military justice . it held him at a marine facility . the rape accusation against hadnott stirred memories of a brutal rape more than a decade ago and triggered outrage across japan . prime minister yasuo fukuda deplored as `` unforgivable '' the allegations against hadnott . the incident also led to tight restrictions , for a time , for american troops and their families at the u.s. base on okinawa . the u.s. military in japan also formed a sexual assault prevention task force after the incident . more than 40,000 u.s. troops are stationed in japan , most of them on okinawa . the troops were placed there under a security alliance after japan was defeated in world war ii and was renounced its right to a military . the u.s. military presence has at times bred resentment among some japanese , who have long complained about crime , noise and accidents . anti-american sentiments boiled over in 1995 after three american servicemen kidnapped and gang-raped a 12-year-old okinawan schoolgirl . two years ago , a u.s. civilian military employee was jailed for nine years for raping two women . e-mail to a friend .
436	berlin . germany -- germany striker kevin kuranyi fired schalke up to joint second in the bundesliga , while bayern munich have a golden chance to put one hand on the league title if they beat stuttgart on sunday . kuranyi 's early goal was enough to give schalke a vital victory over champions league rivals hamburg . kuranyi 's 15th league goal of the season -- after just two minutes -- gave schalke the three points with a 1-0 win in hamburg to go level on 54 points with werder bremen , who shared a thrilling 3-3 draw at karlsruhe . after schalke sacked coach mirko slomka a fortnight ago , caretaker coach mike bueskens was delighted with the victory over their rivals . `` i am very , very pleased with the win , '' he said . `` we beat a direct competitor for a champions league place and the early goal worked very well for us . hamburg played well , but they did n't take their chances . '' schalke and bremen , who remain second on goal difference , are now nine points behind bayern with four games left . a bayern win will send them 12-points clear with a vastly superior goal difference and only a mathematical miracle would prevent them being crowned german champions for the 21st time . but bayern are without internationals miroslav klose and philipp lahm against stuttgart , while oliver kahn is a huge injury doubt for the clash against stuttgart who welcome back mario gomez back from injury . the draw in karlsruhe was a blow to bremen , who were shocked by an early goal when home striker sebastian freis drilled home his 15th minute shot . werder hit back when midfielder diego equalised eight minutes later and former schalke midfielder mesut oezil scored his first goal of the season to put bremen 2-1 ahead on 29 minutes . but freis added his second on 59 minutes before kapllani put karlsruhe ahead only for bremen striker boubacar sanogo to level the scores in the 86th minute . `` it was a very entertaining game and the fans got their money 's worth , '' said bremen coach thomas schaaf . `` but we ca n't be happy with the result , because it was possible for us to keep the pressure on .

439	kampala , uganda -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a fight between ugandan and libyan presidential guards sparked chaos during a ceremony attended by the heads of state from 11 african nations on wednesday . libyan leader moammar gadhafi and ugandan president yoweri museveni attend the opening of the mosque . several of the guards to the visiting heads of state from kenya , tanzania , burundi , rwanda , mali , somalia , sudan and djibouti sustained serious injuries in the fight , which included punches , kicks and the drawing of guns . no leaders were hurt in the melee , though several were knocked over . several journalists also were caught up in the fracas and suffered injuries or lost their grips on cameras and recorders . the incident occurred at the opening of a massive gadhafi national mosque in kampala , a structure begun by the late ugandan dictator idi amin in 1972 and completed with financing from libya , according to african media reports . minutes after libyan leader moammar gadhafi and his host , ugandan president yoweri museveni , jointly unveiled a plaque to mark the event , the libyan guards pushed away the guards of other delegations at the mosque 's entrance . the ugandan guards -- who had traded hostilities with the predominantly-arab libyan guards at every joint event since gadhafi 's arrival in the country sunday -- reacted with fury and fought back . museveni briefly lost his balance when a hefty libyan guard pushed him to a wall . another libyan guard pushed rwandan president paul kagame , who also lost his balance but was caught by his own guards . the vice president of tanzania was knocked over by fighting guards as he was taking his shoes off to enter the mosque . guards to the rest of the visiting presidents and prime ministers kept their respective leaders out of the fray , with some drawing their guns as the dignitaries looked on in disbelief . some leaders -- notably those from somalia , burundi and djibouti -- were visibly uneasy as guns were drawn on all sides . by the time the fight was over more than six minutes later , about a dozen presidential guards were left bleeding from compound fractures and the libyan and ugandan protocol officials traded bitter accusations of disrespect and racism . `` what are your people up to ? do you want to kill our leader ? '' a libyan protocol official said to his ugandan counterpart . the ugandan official , who declined to be named , shouted back , `` why do think you 're superior ? what makes you think uganda has any ill intention against gadhafi ? '' the ugandan official said museveni 's guards were simply doing their job as security for the host country and had a right to respond when the libyan guards pushed them back . it has taken 36 years to complete the giant mosque on a hill in the heart of kampala . it used to be a colonial fort named after british capt. frederick lugard . the mosque can accommodate as many as 17,000 people at one time , according to the engineers , who call it the largest mosque in sub-saharan africa . many muslims interviewed said the mosque 's opening evoked sweet memories of amin , the deceased dictator . `` it is a great day and thanks be to allah for the completion , '' said salim abdul noor , 39 . `` this should remind us that while amin is demonized as africa 's worst dictator , there are many things he did for this country that successive governments largely depend on , and much of the completed installations and structures like this beautiful mosque was amin 's dream , may allah rest him in peace . '' the swedish vice president of the european islamic conference , adly abu hajar , 57 , said the mosque heals rifts in a religion introduced to uganda in 1844 by arab slave traders . `` i find this complex has brought unity among muslims in uganda . there have been so many factions , but this attraction has brought them together , identifying themselves with a common home . '' the fight prompted a crisis meeting by ugandan security authorities , after which invited diplomats from mainly the european missions in uganda expressed dismay . `` it 's disgrace . it shows there is something wrong yet unknown between the two parties , '' said the head of one european mission in kampala , who declined to be named . the police chief , maj. gen. kale kayihura , and the head of the army , gen. aronda nyakairima , declined to comment on the fight . but capt. edison kwesiga , the spokesman of the ugandan presidential guard brigade , confirmed their hostile relationship with the libyans . `` it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of any visiting head of state . we have to do our job using any means . but our libyan brothers always want us to fail . true , it 's not the first time they come and act as you see , '' kwesiga said . e-mail to a friend .

441	baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- four u.s. soldiers died in a roadside bombing in iraq on sunday , military officials reported , bringing the american toll in the 5-year-old war to the grim milestone of 4,000 deaths . troops emerge from a bunker after receiving the `` all clear '' sunday following a truck bombing in mosul . the four were killed when their vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device while patrolling a neighborhood in southern baghdad , the u.s. military headquarters in iraq reported sunday night . a fifth soldier was wounded in the attack , which took place about 10 p.m. -lrb- 3 p.m. et -rrb- . the u.s. milestone comes just days after americans marked the fifth anniversary of the start of the war . `` no casualty is more or less significant than another ; each soldier , marine , airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic , '' rear admiral gregory smith , the u.s. military 's chief spokesman in iraq , said . `` every single loss of a soldier , sailor , airman or marine is keenly felt by military commanders , families and friends both in theatre and at home , '' smith said . of the 4,000 u.s. military personnel killed in the war , 3,263 have been killed in attacks and fighting and 737 in non-hostile incidents , such as traffic accidents and suicides . eight of the 4,000 killed were civilians working for the pentagon . many of those killed over the years , like the four soldiers slain on sunday in baghdad , have been targeted by improvised explosive devices -- the roadside bombs that have been described as the weapon of choice for insurgents and a weapon that has come to symbolize iraq 's tenacious insurgency . the existence of the pentagon 's joint improvised explosive device defeat organization has been developed to counter the threat of ieds in iraq as well as afghanistan . the group calls ieds the `` weapon of choice for adaptive and resilient networks of insurgents and terrorists . '' watch how ieds have become deadly staple in iraq war '' meanwhile , estimates of the iraqi death toll range from about 80,000 to the hundreds of thousands , with another 2 million forced to leave the country and 2.5 million people displaced within iraq , according to the u.n. high commissioner for refugees . president bush ordered u.s. troops into iraq on march 19 , 2003 , after months of warnings that then-iraqi leader saddam hussein was concealing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb . u.n. weapons inspectors found no sign of banned weapons before the invasion , and the cia later concluded that iraq had dismantled its weapons programs in the 1990s . hussein 's government fell in early april 2003 , and iraq 's new government executed him in december 2006 . the news of the 4,000 mark came on the same day that iraq 's national security adviser urged americans to be patient with the progress of the war , contending that it is `` well worth fighting '' because it has implications about `` global terror . '' `` this is global terrorism hitting everywhere , and they have chosen iraq to be a battlefield . and we have to take them on , '' mowaffak al-rubaie said sunday on cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer . '' `` if we do n't prevail , if we do n't succeed in this war , then we are doomed forever , '' he said . `` i understand and sympathize with the mothers , with the widows , with the children who have lost their beloved ones in this country . `` but honestly , it is well worth fighting and well worth investing the money and the treasure and the sweat and the tears in iraq . '' nearly 160,000 u.s. troops remain in iraq , and the war has cost u.s. taxpayers about $ 600 billion , according to the house budget committee . the conflict is now widely unpopular among americans : a cnn-opinion research corp. poll out wednesday found only 32 percent of americans support the conflict . and 61 percent said they want the next president to remove most u.s. troops within a few months of taking office . in the weekly democratic radio address saturday , sen. bob menendez of new jersey said president bush `` took us to war on the wings of a lie . '' menendez said that the war has depleted the resources and morale of the u.s. military ; diverted national attention away from the war in afghanistan , where al qaeda is regrouping ; and hurt the hunt for osama bin laden . the iraq war has not made americans safer , menendez said , but has instead hurt the u.s. economy . the senator called for a `` responsible new direction '' regarding iraq . cnn learned last week , from several u.s. military officials familiar with the recommendations but not authorized to speak on the record , that senior u.s. military officials are preparing to recommend to bush a four - to six-week `` pause '' in additional troop withdrawals from iraq after the last of the `` surge '' brigades leaves in july . `` if the conditions on the ground dictate that we have to have a pause , then we will have to have a pause , '' al-rubaie said . the return of all five brigades added to the iraq contingent last year could reduce troop levels by up to 30,000 , but still leave approximately 130,000 or more troops in iraq . al-rubaie emphasized sunday that any drawdown of u.s. troops `` has to be based on the conditions on the ground . '' `` it depends on the development and the growth and the equipment and the capabilities of the iraqi security forces , and the preparedness of the iraqi security forces , '' he said . `` this should not be a purely political decision . it should be also a technical , military and intelligence decision . '' but there has been too much `` foot-dragging on key governance questions in iraq , '' democratic sen. ron wyden of oregon said on cnn on sunday . `` it seems to me you put off those troop withdrawals , you send exactly the wrong message to the iraqis . '' on wednesday , bush will visit the pentagon to be briefed by the joint chiefs of staff , chaired by adm. michael mullen . the american troop level in iraq `` depends on the negotiations that we are engaged in now between the government of iraq and the united states government , '' al-rubaie said . when conditions warrant the withdrawal of american troops , the iraqis will say '' ` thank you very much , indeed , ' '' al-rubaie said . `` a big , big thank you for the united states of america for liberating iraq , for helping us in sustaining the security gains in iraq ... and we will give them a very , very good farewell party then . '' responding to recent remarks from u.s. presidential candidates that iraqis are not taking responsibility for their own future , al-rubaie said iraqis are making political and security gains . `` literally by the day and by the week , we are gradually assuming more responsibility , '' he said , noting that iraqis have taken responsibility for security in many provinces . other developments : . • u.s. troops raided a suspected suicide bomber cell in diyala province on sunday , killing a dozen militants , half of whom had shaved their bodies -- which the u.s. military says indicates they were in the final stage of preparation for a suicide attack . diyala province stretches north and east of baghdad and has been a major front for u.s. troops fighting militants . • several mortars landed in baghdad 's international zone on sunday , according to the interior ministry . a u.s. embassy spokeswoman said there were no major casualties . watch smoke rise from the green zone '' • a suicide car bomb exploded at a fuel station sunday in a predominantly shiite neighborhood in northwest baghdad , killing seven people and wounding 12 others , the interior ministry said . • a suicide bomber detonated a truck full of explosives outside the main gate of an iraqi military base in mosul , killing at least 10 iraqi soldiers and wounding 35 people , including 20 soldiers , mosul police said . the u.s. military put the death toll higher , at 12 . • a mortar round landed in a shiite neighborhood in eastern baghdad , killing seven people and injuring nine others , a ministry official said . six more mortar rounds landed in other baghdad neighborhoods sunday night , killing three people , the interior ministry said . • in southeastern baghdad , gunmen riding in at least two cars opened fire on a crowded outdoor market , killing at least three people and wounding 17 others , the interior ministry said . • a suicide bomber detonated a small truck rigged with explosives outside a local awakening council leader 's house just east of samarra on saturday , killing at least five people and wounding 13 others , a samarra police official said . awakening councils are largely sunni security groups that have been recruited by the u.s. military . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mohammed tawfeeq contributed to this report .
442	-lrb- this old house -rrb- -- unless you 're a perfect caretaker of your lawn -lrb- and , really , who is ? -rrb- , prepare for another round in the turf wars this summer . you 'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions , of course . and an attack from the crabgrass . but you 'll face more stealthy opponents , too : root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown . `` if a lawn is neglected , or cared for in a hit-or-miss way , it gets weak , '' says this old house landscape contractor roger cook . `` and that 's when weeds , insects , or fungal diseases become a major problem . '' little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders . but as in most battles , the best defense is a strong offense : doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf . that means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week ; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots ; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height -lrb- ask your local garden center what 's best where you live -rrb- ; and fertilizing in spring and fall . so promise yourself -- and your turf -- you 'll do that this year . in the meantime , here 's how to conquer the most common turf problems you 're likely to confront this summer . fungal disease . symptoms : circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass ; or blades with tiny red threads . culprits : powdery mildew , brown patch , dollar spot , and fusarium patch ; or red thread . these fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf . solutions : though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection , if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard , look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions . for an organic fix , search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi . then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits : avoid excessive shade -lrb- prune back trees and large shrubs , if necessary -rrb- and too many applications of fertilizer , herbicides , or pesticides . carefully monitor your turf 's moisture intake and never water in the evening . weeds . symptoms : fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass . this old house : what type of grass is right for your yard . culprits : crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion , purslane , henbit , and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass has n't completely taken root . to check for compacted soil , stick a screwdriver into the ground ; it should slide in easily . solutions : the first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders . the best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe . this will also loosen the soil in affected areas . or use a liquid herbicide in a hand sprayer to spot-treat an infestation . if weeds are too plentiful to be pulled , check your garden center for a `` weed-and-feed '' blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area , or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten . be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly , as some formulas must be applied during a dry spell or need a 24-hour breather with no foot traffic . from here on out , mow up to twice a week during the beginning of summer when grass grows swiftly , and raise the mower blade an inch during hot or dry periods . water well as the summer heats up , and your turf should naturally overtake the weeds . in the fall , open up compacted soil poke holes with a pitchfork over a small yard , or rent a power aerator for large yards and overseed the lawn . you may want to follow up with a pre-emergent herbicide next spring . insects . symptoms : brown turf that becomes loose enough to lift like a mat . culprits : white grubs , a catch-all name for root-chomping beetle larvae , including june bugs , japanese beetles , and masked chafers . to be sure that 's what you 've got , cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back , looking for pale , half-inch - to inch-long c-shaped bugs . if you find more than six , treat the turf . this old house : meet the good bugs . solutions : grubs are the biggest threat to lawns , and pesticides formulated with imidacloprid are proven effective . for an organic fix , spread powdered milky spore or lay down beneficial nematodes-microscopic worms that will feed on the grubs if they 're present . with nematodes , timing the application with their life cycle is critical , so be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly . both milky spore and nematodes can be ordered from some garden centers or online -lrb- gardensalive.com -rrb- . symptoms : irregular-shaped patches of brownish-yellow grass . culprits : chinch bugs , gray-black , quarter-inch-long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack st. augustine and zoysia grasses in the south and kentucky bluegrass in the north . to spot them , bury an empty coffee can , with both ends removed , at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water . the bugs will seek out the moisture , then float to the top . if you see more than 10 after 20 minutes , you should address the problem . solutions : chinch bugs live on the surface , among thatch , so dethatching will reduce their numbers . to eradicate them completely , look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient . longer-term , overseed with chinch-bug-resistant grasses . symptoms : patches of thin lawn with blades chewed off at the base . culprits : sod webworms and tropical sod webworms , hairless cream-to-gray spotted caterpillars that grow into small , buff-colored moths at maturity . the tropical species that thrive in warm southern climates cause the most harm . to check for webworms , mix two tablespoons of mild detergent with two gallons of water ; pour it over the infested turf . any larvae will float to the top . solutions : you can try flooding your lawn to drown them . or choose an appropriate insecticide ; in an organic product , look for the ingredients azadirachtin or spinosad . with extreme cases of tropical webworm infestation you may need to replace the turf with a resistant grass mix . tip : if dogs regularly make a pit stop of your lawn , keep a hose or water bucket nearby . dog urine is high in nitrogen , which can `` burn '' turf , creating a good-sized yellow patch . the best fix is immediate action : flush the area asap with water to dilute it . once badly burned , grass wo n't come back on its own-you 'll have to rake out the dead stuff and reseed . this old house : what to do when your yard is bowser 's bathroom e-mail to a friend . get 2 free trial issues . copyright © 2008 this old house ventures , inc. .
443	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- for two weeks in 1976 , nadia comaneci was probably the most recognizable person on the planet . comaneci scored seven perfect 10s in montreal in 1976 . just 14-years-old and standing less than five feet tall , the elfin romanian was the undisputed star of that year 's games in montreal after becoming the first gymnast in history to score a perfect 10 . comaneci finished up with three gold medals and -- just to prove that her initial effort had been no fluke -- seven perfect scores . her initial performance on the uneven parallel bars was greeted with uproar as the three-digit scoreboard , struggling to cope with what had been considered an unachievable feat , flashed up 1.00 . comaneci finished with four perfect 10s and the gold medal on the bars , but it was on the balance beam , one of gymnastics ' most dangerous disciplines , that comaneci truly dazzled . seemingly fearless , comaneci pirouetted and back-flipped her way to two more perfect 10s and her second gold . her final perfect score came in the floor routine as she also collected first place in the overall competition . comaneci 's transformation into an international celebrity -- she appeared on the front covers of time , newsweek and sports illustrated in the same week -- had been as unexpected as it was sudden . yet comaneci had been working towards the olympics ever since she had been picked out as a gymnast of rare talents as a six-year-old growing up in the industrial town of onesti . the reality of life as an olympic champion at home in nicolae ceausescu 's romania however , was not easy . constant surveillance comaneci was honored as a hero of socialist labor on her return home , yet the regime -- terrified that comaneci would defect after enjoying her taste of western celebrity -- kept its greatest star under constant surveillance . four years later , a very different comaneci returned to olympic competition in moscow . as an 18-year-old , she was four inches taller , 20 pounds heavier and suffering from sciatica -- a teenage starlet already starting to fade . still , comaneci was able to retain her gold medal on the balance beam , and collected another one in the floor exercises . but she was also involved in one of the bitterest incidents of the games when she was controversially beaten in the all-round competition by the soviet gymnast yelena davydova . it took the judges 28 minutes to decide the result and , ultimately , it was a lower score from the soviet judge -- perhaps reflecting the worsening relations between the soviet union and its formerly loyal satellite -- that denied comaneci her second straight gold in the event . comaneci retired in 1984 , traveling to los angeles that year as a team coach , yet she found it difficult to adjust to a life out of the spotlight . in 1989 , a few weeks before the collapse of the ceausescu regime , she defected to the united states , finally settling in norman , oklahoma to run a gymnastics school after marrying u.s. gymnastics star bart conner in 1996 . in 2000 comaneci was named as one of the athletes of the century by the laureus world sports academy . e-mail to a friend .
444	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- who would win in a fight : a police-killing , rampage-driven thug or a superhero encased in a technologically superior suit of armor ? `` grand theft auto iv , '' released tuesday , could give `` iron man '' a run for its money this weekend . the answer could come this weekend when video game enthusiasts find out whether `` grand theft auto iv , '' expected to set sales records in the gaming world this week , will steal glory and revenue from a different entertainment empire : the movies . as the hype for `` gta iv '' continues to grow and reviews scream perfection , some speculate that the game will put a dent in marvel studios ' opening weekend box office for `` iron man . '' `` gta iv '' is the ninth incarnation of a video game in which the user acts as a criminal roaming a city . the series has faced criticism for being too violent , because users are allowed to beat , stab , shoot and kill citizens and police officers . `` iron man '' is a movie based on the marvel comic book superhero who creates an impressive suit of armor to save his life and help save the world . `` gta iv '' was released tuesday at midnight and is expected to gross about $ 400 million in the first week . see what makes this violent game so popular '' edward woo , a research analyst specializing in media and interactive entertainment at wedbush morgan securities , said the game 's release date and widespread reach could negatively affect opening box office numbers for `` iron man . '' `` people on friday or saturday might find themselves at home playing this game instead of at the cineplex , '' woo said . '' ` iron man ' will still have a pretty good release , but intuitively , i think it 's got be impacted when both share a similar audience and genre . '' because of the time element the game requires of its faithful -- between 30 and 40 hours to finish depending on skill level -- the question is whether gamers will put down their controllers for a couple of hours and go for a change of scenery . paramount vice chairman rob moore said he is n't worried . `` it 's crazy to think that young males ca n't carve out two hours for ` iron man , ' '' he told ew.com . `` it 's going to be a great week to be a young guy . '' watch why violence in the game concerns some people '' this weekend wo n't be the first time analysts have speculated about video games damaging box office numbers . last year , with $ 170 million in launch day sales and $ 300 million in its first week , `` halo 3 '' was blamed by some for the poor box office performance of `` the heartbreak kid , '' starring ben stiller . take-two interactive , the parent company of `` gta iv '' publisher rockstar games , predicted that with 6 million preorders worldwide , the game will bring in more than $ 400 million . `` gta iv '' has a chance of surpassing the movie `` pirates of the caribbean : at world 's end '' as the highest-grossing entertainment title in its first week of sales , and that 's across all genres . electronic arts ceo john riccitiello told the financial times this month that movie executives told him , '' ` iron man ' the movie is going to get killed by ` grand theft auto , ' the game . `` i do n't think i 've ever heard of that before , '' he said . the video game market is growing at a rate of 20 to 30 percent this year , but the movie industry is n't seeing as much of an increase , woo said . overall , video game sales as a whole have eclipsed box office sales , he said , but the movie industry catches up when it comes to dvds . ebullient reviews touted the game as `` the godfather '' of video games because of its cult-like following . andrew reiner , who reviewed `` gta iv '' for game informer , a well-known destination for all things gaming , scored it as a 10.0 / 10.0 under the title of `` perfection . '' `` i now know how film critics felt after screening ` the godfather , ' '' his review began . `` gta iv '' is a `` landscape-changing event that does n't come around very often , '' reiner said . it seems the feelings have translated to the regular consumer too . gamers from norway to britain to america echoed similar sentiments on gaming message boards . d.j. brotherson from winnipeg , canada , said he enjoyed the game so much , he wanted to skip work and keep playing all night , saying it was unlike any game he had ever played . `` the story line is very well-written , '' he said , adding that the game `` plays like an interactive martin scorsese movie .

446	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- one of the telephone numbers used to report claims of abuse at a polygamist sect 's texas ranch was previously associated with a colorado woman whom authorities have named a `` person of interest , '' a court document says . rozita swinton , 33 , has been arrested in a case that is not directly related to the texas raid . the telephone calls in late march prompted authorities to raid the yearning for zion -lrb- yfz -rrb- ranch in eldorado , texas , where 437 children were removed . the ranch is owned by the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , a mormon offshoot that practices polygamy . rozita swinton , 33 , of colorado springs , colorado , was arrested this month on a charge of making a false report to police . the charge relates to an incident in february , but the texas rangers have said she is a person of interest in connection with the ranch calls . in the february incident , swinton is accused of calling authorities using the names `` dana anderson '' and `` april , '' reporting abuse by male relatives , according to an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant . authorities have not clearly said that they think swinton made the march phone calls that prompted the raid . but the affidavit says she is `` known to make false reports of sexual abuse to the police and other agencies . '' watch how a hoax may be behind the ranch mystery '' calls were made to a texas family shelter march 29 and 30 from a female identifying herself as sarah barlow , the affidavit says . the caller said she was 16 , had a baby about 8 months old and was pregnant again . she said that her 49-year-old husband was physically and sexually abusive toward her and that they were living at the yfz ranch . the phone calls were made from a prepaid cell phone with no available records , according to the affidavit . however , it has been used in other cases linked to swinton , the document says . although texas officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls , they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch . the flds has denied that any abuse takes place at the ranch . the woman identifying herself as sarah barlow also called a battered women 's shelter in snohomish county , washington , using another phone number , the affidavit says . that phone number was traced to swinton 's address , the affidavit says . on april 10 , the woman called the washington shelter again and was put on the line with a texas deputy . she said she felt that she would be punished for the trouble she had caused , was worried that her baby might be taken away and was angry with a woman she had contacted march 29 for prompting the raid by law enforcement . during that conversation , the affidavit says , the woman used terminology common to the flds , referring to her `` sister wives , '' for instance . the phone number used in the washington call was traced to the colorado springs apartment where swinton lives , the affidavit says . the number was also used to call a utah organization for women escaping polygamy and an abuse counseling center in fort myers , florida , phone records showed . swinton pleaded guilty to a charge of false reporting in june 2007 and was under a 12-month deferred sentence , the affidavit says . at a custody hearing last week , a texas judge ruled that the state will temporarily retain custody of the 437 children removed in the raid . meanwhile , on tuesday evening , laboratory workers at san angelo coliseum completed taking dna samples from mothers and children , said janice rolfe , a spokeswoman for the state attorney general 's office . she did not say how many samples were taken . about 100 of the seized children from whom swab dna samples had already been taken were bused tuesday from the san angelo coliseum to group foster homes , the texas department of health and family services said . on wednesday , workers in eldorado continued to take voluntary dna samples from adults who live on the yfz ranch , rolfe said . rolfe said that at least 54 samples from adults have been taken there . the dna samples will be sent to laboratory corporation of america , based in burlington , north carolina . it could take longer than a month to get results . judge barbara walther , who last week ordered the dna testing of the children and ordered that they remain in state custody , signed an order this week authorizing the children 's move to foster care , officials said . at a meeting wednesday afternoon , walther and the state 's child protective services division agreed that 18 mothers with breast-feeding babies that are 1 year old or younger will be allowed to stay with their children in the homes where the children are placed . also , 23 mothers with 28 children ages 1 to 2 years will be allowed to stay in the same towns as their children . the remaining children , 2 to 18 years old , will be split up into available homes . the original order signed by walther called for every effort to keep siblings together , especially in the case of small children . rod parker , a spokesman for the flds families , blasted the action in a news conference from his salt lake city , utah , office . `` the cps department of texas is afraid of due process , '' he said . `` they would lose in a fair fight in this case , and that is why you 're seeing them move so quickly , and that is why you 're seeing them move unilaterally .

'' watch cutts ' tearful apology '' he thanked davis ' family for taking care of the other child he had with davis . blake was 2 1/2 at the time of his mother 's murder in june 2007 . `` i pray that you find peace and you someday find room for forgiveness , '' he said . earlier , cutts ' mother , renee , jones , had told jurors , `` i do n't know what i would do without him . '' she described cutts as a former honor student who loved his job as a police officer . `` he was my firstborn , my only son , '' jones testified tearfully . `` he means so much to me , '' she continued . `` he used to call me three , four times a day . '' watch cutts react as his mother pleads for his life . cutts ' punishment is being decided by the same jury of six men and six women who found him guilty . all the jurors are white ; cutts is african-american . cutts ' sister , father and one of his school teachers also testified . judge charles e. brown ordered jurors to return early tuesday for attorneys ' closing arguments . when the arguments conclude , jurors will begin their deliberations . if jurors do not agree on the death penalty , cutts could receive a possible sentence of life in prison without parole or become eligible for parole in 20 , 25 or 30 years . jones , was the first witness called to the stand by the defense . she said her son was a good youngster who was active in sports , scouts and his church . `` i never had any trouble out of him , '' she said as cutts teared up at the defense table . she said cutts ' relationship with his father deteriorated after the parents split . a former teacher described cutts as a social child given the nickname `` gobble '' by his classmates . he was helpful in class , often volunteering to pick stray crayons up from the floor . his father testified that he gave cutts the nickname `` gobble '' because as an infant he resembled '' a little butterball turkey . '' he said cutts was a `` gifted child '' in school . he blamed himself for the break up of his marriage , saying his drinking and gambling contributed to it . cutts ' own personal life was rocky , according to testimony . davis was nine months pregnant when she disappeared in june 2007 . her body was found in a northeastern ohio park after a 10-day search that brought national media attention . he is blake 's father , as well as the father of the unborn girl , chloe . according to testimony , cutts , 30 , rolled davis ' body in a comforter and dumped it in a park , leaving toddler son blake in the house alone at the crime scene in a soiled diaper . `` mommy 's in the rug , '' blake told police , according to testimony . during the guilt phase of the trial , cutts sobbed on the witness stand as he admitted killing davis and chloe . but cutts insisted that their deaths were an accident . `` i did n't mean to hurt her , '' cutts testified , clasping a handful of tissues . `` this is n't real , '' he said he kept telling himself . prosecutors discounted cutts ' story , claiming he buckled under the financial pressure of child support , killed the mother of his child and then created a cover story to try to get away with it . on the stand , cutts said he went to pick up his son , blake , and became agitated when davis , 26 , was n't moving fast enough to get the boy ready . he said he tried to leave her house , but she grabbed him to keep him from leaving , and he accidentally elbowed her in the throat . cutts told the jury he performed cpr on davis and then tried to revive her with bleach . when he realized davis was dead , cutts said he panicked and put her in the back of his truck , so blake would n't have to see his mother . e-mail to a friend .
449	boston , massachusetts -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it all started with the flush of an automatic toilet . the terrifying sound marked the beginning of a two-year nightmare for sarah teres as she desperately tried to potty train her daughter molly . molly graduated from potty school four days before her brother , archer , was born . `` it was awful '' teres said . `` we tried everything including bribery and threats . '' teres , the mother of three from andover , massachusetts , hoped her middle child would be toilet trained by the time she was 2 1/2 . two years later , the girl was still in diapers , refusing to use the bathroom . `` i was going crazy , '' teres admitted . `` she would n't poop . she would hold it for days . '' at wits end , teres enrolled molly in the toilet training school at children 's hospital boston . `` by the time the children come in with their families , it has become a power struggle , '' explained dr. alison schonwald , a pediatrician who supervises the `` poop school , '' as it 's affectionately called by staffers . `` the kids kind of dig in their heels and put a line in the sand . '' health minute : watch more on the perils of potty training '' the american academy of pediatrics reports that most children show signs they 're ready to potty train between 18 and 24 months . doctors suggest a child may be ready to start trying if he 's staying dry for at least two hours at a time during the day , walking to and from the bathroom , asking for a diaper change and asking to use the potty . for some kids , the toilet training process can take more than a year , or longer . the six-week program at children 's hospital is one of a handful around the country . kimberly dunn , a pediatric nurse practitioner , has worked with some of the 450 young graduates over the years . she said most of the kids admit they are afraid to use a toilet . `` oftentimes , the parents come in and they want to know why they 're afraid , '' dunn said . `` you could ask the kids until they 're blue in the face and you hardly ever find out why . '' dunn meets with a half-dozen children once a week . she uses books , music and art to help the students overcome their fear of using the toilet . she helps them set small , realistic goals . for instance , she said , week one involved just sitting on the toilet for five minutes . she encourages positive reinforcement and simple rewards such as extra playtime with mom or dad . while dunn works on the kids , psychologist elaine leclair , an instructor at the harvard school of medicine , offers frank advice to the parents in a separate room . `` i just say , ` step back . ' they hate to hear me say this , but i say whatever you 're doing now is not working . you really need to try something different , '' leclair said . she said many parents come to the sessions angry and anxious . `` they come in feeling extremely discouraged , very isolated thinking they are the only ones in the world who have this problem . '' teres acknowledged that 's how she felt . `` imagine my surprise to find out there were thousands of kids who had this problem . '' after years of hiding her daughter 's toilet training troubles from family and friends , the group parenting sessions allowed teres to open up about her frustrations . `` it was like going to betty ford , '' joked teres , who felt she had exhausted all her other options . a majority of the children who attend the children 's hospital class are dealing with constipation issues often caused by delayed toilet training . teres learned that her daughter had a medical condition called encopresis . experts call it a symptom of chronic constipation and say it occurs when a child resists having a bowel movement . youngsters like molly are sometimes given laxatives or other medications to help encourage them to go . schonwald , the author of `` the pocket idiot 's guide to potty training , '' does n't want parents to be discouraged during the process . `` no one goes to college in diapers , right ? everyone will get through this time , as awful as it might feel if you 're struggling . '' she suggested achieving success during potty training has to do with the approach . `` there are three things you can not make a child do : eat , sleep or poop . we find that by decreasing the pressure and expectations that children feel more confident . '' schonwald reminds parents that toilet training `` is not a chore , so keeping it positive from the very beginning is the most important thing . '' if a child is n't using the toilet by the age of 4 , she recommends talking with a pediatrician . schonwald also said setbacks during potty training are normal . `` all developmental skills come in spurts with periods of regression . '' after a setback , schonwald advises parents to give their child positive messages that they can succeed by saying , `` so you had some accidents today . we 'll try again tomorrow . '' four months after graduating from `` poop school , '' teres is relieved to report that molly is fully toilet trained . `` you would never know this was an issue , '' said teres . `` she even used an automatic flush toilet the other day . i waited to see her reaction and she was ok .

450	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some democrats say they fear their party 's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic as neither presidential candidate is likely to gather the delegates needed for the nomination . the democrats ' superdelegate system is supposed to avoid turmoil at the party 's conventions . sens. hillary clinton and barack obama are running neck and neck toward the party 's august convention in denver , colorado . most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then . party rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers , elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance . the party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention . but even some superdelegates are questioning the system , as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome . `` it 's not the most democratic way of doing things , '' said maine superdelegate sam spencer . watch the scenario for a `` civil war '' in the democratic party '' at least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses . moveon.org , which has endorsed obama , is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in usa today . and democracy for america , headed by democratic national committee chairman howard dean 's brother jim , said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates . while pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they 'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus , superdelegates are free to vote however they want . and even if they pledge their support to a candidate , they 're free to change at any time . clinton already has 234 superdelegates and obama has 157 . but obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates , 1,096 to 977 , and is on a roll , having won all eight nominating contests since super tuesday . see which states pledged delegates come from '' if the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote , the turmoil would last long beyond the convention , longtime democratic party strategist tad devine said . `` if a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses , but by politicians in some mythical backroom , i think that the public could react strongly against that , '' devine said . `` the problem is -lsb- if -rsb- people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead , insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process , particularly the young people who are voting for the first time , will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated , '' he said . superdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate democrats back to conventions , where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s , and to relect the party 's mainstream more accurately . '' -lsb- superdelegates -rsb- are the keepers of the faith , '' said former san francisco , california , mayor willie brown . `` you have superdelegates because this is the democratic party . you do n't want the bleed-over from the green party , the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be . '' devine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former vice president walter mondale in 1984 . mondale 's 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former sen. gary hart and jesse jackson . mondale had received more votes , but hart had won more states . mondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor . each campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side . jason rae , a 21-year-old wisconsin superdelegate , said he 's gotten calls from former president clinton and former secretary of state madeleine albright from hillary clinton 's camp , and obama 's wife , michelle , visited with him during a campaign stop tuesday in wisconsin . rae said he has n't yet decided how he 'll vote in wisconsin 's primary on tuesday . crystal strait , a party activist from california , said she 's received calls from clinton herself and daughter chelsea but she remains uncommitted . massachusetts superdelegate john walsh said he 'll stay loyal to obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in walsh 's state . so will fellow massachusetts superdelegates sens. edward kennedy and john kerry . among clinton 's committed superdelegates are harold ickes jr. , her husband 's former deputy chief of staff ; terry mcauliffe , who led her husband 's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign ; and her husband . whether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates , even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote , could split the party . `` it 's in a total contradiction of the way the democrats have set up their primary process , with all this proportional representation , '' said cnn political analyst amy holmes . `` the whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites . and if this is decided by superdelegates , i think the democratic party morally is going to be looking at each other and say , ` what did we just do ? ' '' devine said it could hurt the party in the general election . `` i think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we 're saying we will pursue in government as democrats are based on fairness , whether it 's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance , there 's a fairness component in all of that , '' he said . `` people need to believe , i think , that our process is fair as well , if they want to believe that our policies will be fair .

451	adelaide , australia -- world record-breaking wicketkeeper adam gilchrist has announced he will retire from cricket at the end of the australian summer . adam gilchrist takes a spectacular catch off mahendra singh dhoni in the third test against india . the 36-year-old chose australia day to make his decision public , coming at the end of the third day of the fourth and final test against india in adelaide . gilchrist said he would retire from tests at the end of the current match , and then hang up his gloves in one-day internationals after the upcoming tri-series with sri lanka and india . `` it is with great pride and happiness that i make the decision to retire from tests and one-day internationals , '' he said in a statement on saturday . `` i 've come to the decision after much thought and discussion with those most important to me . `` my family and i have been fortunate to have had an amazing journey full of rich experiences throughout my career and are sincerely grateful to all who have helped make this stage of our lives so fulfilling . `` i am now ready and excited to move into the next phase of my life which will , of paramount importance , include much more time with my family . '' gilchrist broke the world record for the most wicketkeeping dismissals in tests with 414 on friday , overtaking south africa 's mark boucher in his 96th outing in the five-day game . boucher , by comparison , played in 109 tests . gilchrist took over the gloves from ian healy -- third on the list with 395 dismissals from 119 tests -- in november 1999 , and went on to establish himself both as a wicketkeeper and as a batsman of brutal hitting capabilities . he has scored 5,556 runs to date , at an average of 47.89 , with a highest score of 204 not out and having made 17 centuries . he has been similarly prolific in 277 one-dayers , scoring 9,297 runs at an average of 36 and reaching three figures 15 times . gilchrist 's revelation came as australia put themselves in a strong position to win the series against the touring indians , reaching 322-3 at stumps . captain ricky ponting , whose team lead 2-1 , was unbeaten on 79 after adding an unbroken 81 for the fourth wicket with michael clarke -lrb- 37 -rrb- . resuming the day on 62-0 in reply to india 's imposing first innings of 526 , matthew hayden and phil jaques took their opening stand to 159 . jaques was the first to fall , bowled by india captain anil kumble for a patient 60 off 159 deliveries . hayden , on his return after missing the defeat in perth due to a hamstring injury , reached his 30th test century before being bowled by 19-year-old seamer ishant sharma for 103 off 200 balls . ponting , who came in at first drop , added another 55 with mike hussey before the left-hander was also castled by fast bowler irfan pathan for 22 to leave the home side teetering a little at 241-3 . but ponting , who has struggled for form so far in the series , ground out his 40th half-century in tests and clarke provided able support to take australia through to the close of play with no further loss of wickets . e-mail to a friend .
452	bogota , colombia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- colombian police have killed a drug trafficker who the government says is one of the most sought-after fugitive outside the country 's rebel leaders . victor manuel mejia munera was a drug lord with ties to paramilitary groups , the colombian government says . victor manuel mejia munera and two bodyguards were killed tuesday when police tracked them down on a farm in the northwestern province of antioquia , according to a statement on the colombian presidency web site . three people also were arrested , according to the statement . mejia munera was wearing an american-style , desert-camouflage uniform when he was killed , said colombian defense minister juan manuel santos . mejia munera also had short - and long-range weapons with ammunition , the presidential statement said . `` this is a great strike of the public force against the criminal structures of the country , '' santos said , warning that drug traffickers who do not turn themselves over to the government will `` end up in the jail or in a tomb . '' in terms of the country 's most-wanted list , mejia munera was one of colombia 's most sought-after criminals and ranked just below the leaders of revolutionary armed forces of colombia , the statement said . the leftist guerilla group , which goes by its spanish acronym farc , holds about 750 hostages in the jungles of colombia and has justified hostage-taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long-running civil war involving government forces , drug traffickers and right-wing paramilitaries . mejia munera is not alleged to have ties to farc , but he had been involved with a right-wing paramilitary group known as united self-defense forces of colombia , according to the u.s. state department . mejia munera and his brother , miguel angel mejia munera , known as `` los mellizos , '' or `` the twins , '' have been accused of running major drug rings in colombia . the brothers also have faced narcotics-trafficking charges in the united states . santos initially told reporters that police had killed miguel angel mejia munera . the colombian presidency later said the slain drug lord was actually victor manuel mejia munera . fingerprints confirmed that the dead man was victor mejia munera , colombian-based caracol radio reported . the brothers sometimes exchanged identities , the radio station said , and identity documents belonging to miguel mejia munera were found near victor mejia munera . in 2004 , the u.s. district court for the district of columbia indicted the twins on narcotics-trafficking charges . the u.s. justice department at one point offered a $ 5 million reward for `` true and effective information '' on the whereabouts of a dozen suspects it wanted extradited to the united states . one of the 12 men wanted was miguel mejia munera . the state department said wednesday there was no reward for victor mejia munera . the u.s. treasury department 's office of foreign assets control reported that the brothers have been involved in narcotics trafficking since the early 1990s , when they were guarding ships carrying cocaine from western colombia to mexico . `` over time , '' ofac said in a news release last year , the brothers `` rose through the ranks to lead their own narcotics trafficking organization . '' `` recent reports indicate that los mellizos may be funding their own illegal armed groups to facilitate their narcotics trafficking activities , '' the release said . the colombian prosecutor general 's office had indicted victor mejia munera for his role in a 2004 paramilitary massacre of 11 farmers in tame in the eastern colombian province of arauca , according to the state department . e-mail to a friend .
453	rome , italy -- captain javier zanetti saved inter milan 's unbeaten serie a record as he rifled home a stunning late volley to earn a 1-1 draw against second-placed roma at the san siro on wednesday . zanetti celebrates his late strike as inter retained their unbeaten serie a record with a 1-1 draw against roma . roma captain francesco totti had given the visitors a deserved first-half leadbut zanetti 's strike two minutes from time maintained inter 's nine-point lead at the top . roma needed to win to breathe new life into the title race but they were dealt a cruel blow as french defender philippe mexes was sent-off late on for two bookings in quick succession . inter capitalised and they have now lost only once in their last 65 league matches . the home side had the first clear-cut chance of the match and were within centimeters of taking the lead when hernan crespo met a cross from patrick vieira with an acrobatic volley , but saw his effort cannon back off the post . the defending champions were made to pay for that miss on 38 minutes as the visitors orchestrated a sublime goal . neat footwork from macedonia international mirko vucinic released max tonetto down the left and his pin-point cross was flicked home at the near post by totti from six meters out as he stole in front of defender cristian chivu . inter center-back nicolas burdisso should have restored parity in first-half stoppage time but his header from luis figo 's corner flew over the bar . figo himself had a great chance on 54 minutes but after having time to set himself up for an attempted volley , he skewed his effort so badly that it did not even go out of play . after mexes ' dismissal 10 from time , inter laid siege to roma 's goal . goalkeeper doni had to be alert to tip over crespo 's header three minutes from time but he could do nothing about zanetti 's volley a minute later . meanwhile , ac milan slipped to fifth place as they were held to a 1-1 draw at catania . brazilian teenager pato gave them the lead early in the second half with a skimming long-range shot but substitute gionathan spinesi 's header earnt the sicilians a point . fiorentina are up to fourth after they defeated livorno 1-0 at home thanks to a goal from senegal forward ndiaye papa waigo . e-mail to a friend .
454	glasgow , scotland -- jean-claude darcheville and nacho novo both scored twice to fire leaders rangers to a 4-0 win at hearts , their 10th consecutive scottish premier league victory . jean-claude darcheville scored two first-half goals as rangers cruised to a 4-0 victory at hearts . hearts found themselves ripped apart by a rampant rangers side , who sent out a clear message to rivals celtic by maintaining their four-point advantage at the summit . darcheville claimed the opener after 25 minutes , cutting inside from the left and squeezing his shot inside the far post from a tight angle . the same player added a second two minutes before the break , scoring from close range after a barry ferguson corner was not cleared . darcheville was withdrawn for novo at the interval , but if hearts thought the departure of the frenchman meant some much-needed respite , they were sadly mistaken . novo was on the pitch for seven minutes when he helped himself to a goal of his own . charlie adam set up the shot with a low ball across goal and all that was required from the striker was to bundle home from close range . the same two players combined again to supply rangers with their fourth goal with 69 minutes gone . adam was again the provider and this time novo produced a cheeky back-heel finish from five meters . meanwhile , goals by scott mcdonald and georgios samaras gave celtic a hard-fought 2-1 win at home to inverness caledonian thistle . australian international mcdonald 's 25th goal of the season right on the interval gave the champions the lead and his greek team-mate bulleted an aiden mcgeady cross past goalkeeper michael fraser on the hour mark . but the final minutes were needlessly fraught for celtic after caley striker marius niculae took advantage of scott brown 's misplaced pass to pull a goal back in the 70th minute . e-mail to a friend .

459	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- ever find yourself struggling to craft the perfect sentence for a loved one who 's , um , serving a sentence ? now , you have a friend in the greeting card business . terrye cheathem has created a line of greeting cards geared toward prison inmates . a los angeles , california , lawyer has come up with a series of cards geared toward prison inmates , a rapidly growing segment of the u.s. population . some express simple good wishes : `` we are all praying for you while you do your time . '' others celebrate holidays : `` you had the choice to be ` naughty or nice . ' and you chose ... now you have to do your time . but , christmas wo n't be the same without you here . '' others dole out tough love : `` when you called last time , i was not very sympathetic . i guess that i have heard your promises to change too many times . please - stop promising to change . just do it . '' creator terrye cheathem said the cards let family members say `` look , things need to be different when you get out . '' she came up with the idea a few years ago while looking -- without success -- for a birthday card to send her brother-in-law , who was serving an 11-month sentence . `` there are so many people who have mixed feelings about communicating with their loved ones in prison , '' cheathem said thursday . `` they are unhappy , oftentimes profoundly embarrassed . people do n't know what to say . '' so she created three squares greetings to capture the sentiments for a captive audience -- one that seems to be getting larger each year . more than 2.3 million people were in jails or prisons in the united states at the beginning of 2008 , according to a study released last month by the pew center on the states . the center is a private organization that advocates for alternative programs to alleviate prison populations . for the first time in the nation 's history , the center says , more than one in 100 americans are behind bars , a higher proportion than any other country . cheathem is selling her cards online and through stores . she also wants jails and prisons to carry cards designed for inmates to send their relatives . `` they 're ` thank you ' cards , '' she said . '' ` thank you for visiting , ' ` thank you for bringing the kids , ' ` thank you for coming to court . ' '' like many , bookstore owner james fugate was at first reluctant to carry the line in his los angeles shop , esowon books . `` i have some issues of being nice to criminals , '' fugate said . `` and in my 20 years in business , i 've seen some relatives who do n't seem to realize the gravity of what -lrb- their family members -rrb- have done . '' fugate said he changed his mind when he realized that most of the cards carried messages asking inmates to turn their lives around . cheathem understands the hesitation of shoppers and sellers . `` i ca n't think of any other product that anyone wants to receive and certainly no one wants to be in the position to buy one , '' she said . `` but there is a need for this . '' cheathem points to mayor kwame kilpatrick of detroit , michigan . he was charged this week with perjury , obstruction of justice and misconduct of office . he was released on a $ 75,000 bond . `` i have a card that says , ` i 'm sorry to hear about your arrest , ' '' she said . `` right now , there are probably 50 people or more who would send it to him .

461	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- army gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. commander in iraq , has been chosen to become chief of u.s. central command , defense secretary robert gates said wednesday . gen. david petraeus has been the commander in iraq for more than a year . petraeus would replace adm. william fallon , who said last month that he was resigning . fallon said widespread , but false , reports that he was at odds with the bush administration over iran had made his job impossible . in addition , gates said , army lt. gen. ray odierno , commander of the multinational corps-iraq -- the no. 2 position in iraq -- is being nominated to fill petraeus ' post . odierno has been home from iraq for only a couple of months but has agreed to return , gates said . the plan is for petraeus to leave iraq in late summer or early fall , gates said , to ensure a smooth transition and plenty of time for odierno to prepare . `` we expect to move the paperwork on these nominations to the white house and to the senate very quickly , '' gates said . `` because of the complexity of this series of moves , i respectfully ask the senate to move on them expeditiously , hopefully by memorial day , so the families and we can plan appropriately . '' odierno was in line for a pentagon desk job as army vice chief just over a year after helping petraeus implement the `` surge '' in u.s. troops in iraq . the pentagon says petraeus will stay in iraq long enough to make the first recommendation on further troop cuts after the surge is over . watch the challenges ahead of petraeus '' gates said the generals ' promotions reflected an endorsement of the current course in iraq . `` the course certainly that gen. petraeus has set has been a successful course . so , frankly , i think staying that course is not a bad idea . i would say it 's a good idea , '' gates said . watch gates nominate petraeus '' central command , which oversees u.s. forces in east africa , the middle east and central asia , has its headquarters at macdill air force base in tampa , florida . gates said odierno is well known to troops in iraq , to military leadership and to iraqis , and `` i believe , in most parts of the world , especially in the middle east , personal relationships make a difference . '' `` i believe that this arrangement will probably preserve the likelihood of continued momentum and progress , '' gates said . the defense secretary said he expects to easily win senate approval for the nominations once they are made by president bush . he said he had spoken with sens. carl levin , d-michigan ; john mccain , r-arizona ; and john warner , r-virginia , and `` i do n't really anticipate any problems . '' in a press release wednesday , mccain praised the move . `` both of these great generals have served our country with skill and distinction , and i am pleased that they will continue to do so in positions of high responsibility , '' mccain wrote . gates acknowledged that fallon 's `` decision to step down was unexpected . '' `` i had intended that adm. fallon probably stay on for a third year . his second year would have ended in february , '' he said . `` so i 'm faced with a critical combatant command where a commander is needed -- and a commander who knows what 's going on in the region . '' asked whether he was using petraeus `` almost as a finger in the dike '' because of the shortage of army generals with expertise in counterinsurgency warfare , gates admitted that there are few army officers with experience in and knowledge of iraq . odierno served as commander of the 4th infantry division , the unit that captured former iraqi president saddam hussein . petraeus was picked in january 2007 to replace gen. george casey as the chief commander in iraq and won senate confirmation that month . he previously served as head of the u.s. army combined arms center and as a commander in iraq , and he was one of the main writers of an army manual on counterinsurgency efforts . he was seen as the logical choice to replace fallon . in his new post , he will oversee u.s. forces in all the middle east , not only iraq and afghanistan . `` i recommended him to the president because i am absolutely confident he is the best man for the job , '' gates said . in testimony to congress this month , petraeus said iranian agents have played a `` destructive role '' in iraq by backing shiite militants , called `` special groups '' by the united states . the u.s. believes that iran 's islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force is behind the support for militants . `` unchecked , the special groups pose the greatest long-term threat to the viability of a democratic iraq , '' petraeus testified . last month , in an interview with cnn 's kyra phillips in baghdad , petraeus acknowledged some `` friction '' between himself and fallon in the past year , but `` actually , over the last six months or so , our relationship was really very , very good . '' `` there was friction in the beginning . he has a different job than i have , '' petraeus said . `` there can be understandable differences of your take , if you will , on a situation . as they say in politics and government 101 , where you stand on an issue sometimes depends on where you sit in the organization , and we sit in different chairs .

463	baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- six u.s. troops were killed in iraq on monday , making 2007 the deadliest for the american military in the iraq war . the grim record came despite lower death rates in recent months , which were not enough to offset death tolls that topped 100 during three months in the spring . four soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb exploded near their vehicle in northern iraq 's tameem province ; another died in combat in anbar province . a sailor was killed in salaheddin province `` as a result of injuries sustained from an explosion while conducting operations , '' the military said . according to a cnn count of pentagon figures , 853 u.s. service members have died so far in 2007 . the next highest death toll was in 2004 , when 849 were killed . the total number of u.s. military deaths in iraq stands at 3,856 , including seven civilian contractors of the defense department . the high number of deaths this year corresponds with the u.s. troop buildup called the `` surge '' and a crackdown on insurgents in and near baghdad . monthly death tolls were highest in the first part of the year : 83 deaths in january , 81 in february and 81 in march . numbers peaked in the next three months , with 104 deaths in april , 126 in may and 101 in june . the numbers have dropped from that level since -- with 78 in july , 84 in august , 65 in september , 38 in october and 12 so far in november . civilian deaths have also dropped in recent months , u.s. and iraqi authorities say . the iraq war began in march of 2003 and in that year there were 486 u.s. military deaths . in 2004 , major offensives were responsible for many fatalities , including the massive operation in falluja in november and fighting between u.s. troops and shiite militants in najaf . the number of deaths in 2005 was 846 and in 2006 it was 822 . the u.s. military also announced on tuesday that it intends to release nine detained iranians in iraq `` in the coming days , '' a move that dovetails with the american hope that iranian authorities are honoring a recent pledge to stop iranian help to insurgents in iraq . `` these individuals have been assessed to have no continuing value '' and do n't pose a `` further threat '' to iraqi security , said rear adm. gregory smith . two of them are from the `` irbil 5 '' detained in january . irbil is the largest city in the kurdish area of iraq . the u.s. military had accused the five iranians arrested in irbil of having links to iran 's islamic revolutionary guard-quds force , a military unit accused of aiding insurgent activity -- including the distribution of roadside bombs . smith said tuesday that materials for roadside bombs `` do not appear to have arrived into iraq after the iranians have made their pledge to stop arming , funding and training extremists . '' `` we hope in the coming weeks and months to confirm that iran has indeed honored its pledge through further verification that the flow of ammunitions and other lethal aid has indeed stopped , '' said smith , who noted that iran , iraq and the united states plan to hold another round of security talks . last month , gen. david petraeus , the top-ranking u.s. military official in iraq , told cnn the iranian ambassador had given assurances to his iraqi counterpart that such training and supplying of insurgents would end . meanwhile , a kurdistan regional government official on tuesday confirmed to cnn that two iranian consulates had been established in the region , offices created in the wake of the arrests in irbil . at the time of the arrests , iran insisted the arrested officials were `` diplomats '' working in a diplomatic mission , while iraq 's foreign ministry and the u.s. military said it was a `` liaison '' office which did not have diplomatic status . one of the new consulates is in a building in irbil that had been closed down during the january raid , the kurdistan official said . also tuesday , the u.s. military reported that u.s. and iraqi troops found 22 corpses buried in iraq 's lake tharthar region . the iraqi army and local security forces `` are investigating the mass grave to determine the identities of the deceased and the causes of death for notification of their families , '' the military said . lake tharthar is in both anbar and salaheddin provinces and northwest of baghdad . u.s. and iraqi troops have been conducting an operation in the same region since sunday to target al qaeda in iraq . so far , they have found and destroyed two car bomb facilities and a number of weapons caches and detained 30 men . the military also said that coalition troops on tuesday killed eight people described as terrorists and detained 10 suspects in operations targeting al qaeda and foreign militant networks in central and northern iraq . the military also said an operation involving iraqi forces in the tikrit area on october 30 led to the detention of 39 `` suspected insurgents '' and the discovery of a torture cell , a mobile hospital , car bombs , rocket-propelled grenades , machine guns and a katyusha rocket . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's jennifer deaton contributed to this report .
464	greensburg , kansas -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there are still piles of bricks and rubble on countless streets in greensburg , kansas , a year after a tornado demolished more than 90 percent of the town . on may 4 , 2007 , a ferocious twister blasted greensburg , kansas , killing 11 people in the town of 1,400 . yet what is happening in the city 's rebuilding process may not only re-invent greensburg but provide a model for `` green '' building everywhere . just a week after the deadly tornado hit may 4 , 2007 , a similar idea sparked in the mayor , a representative from the governor 's office and a nonprofit expert from a nearby town . the concept : if the whole town had to be rebuilt anyway , why not be bold and build it as a global example of conservation , energy efficiency and creativity ? daniel wallach , the nonprofit specialist , soon got the green light to help residents and businesses start over in a project known as greensburg greentown . `` kansas is known for being very conservative , '' wallach said . watch how the town went green '' `` my first order of business was to listen . what i heard were a lot of concerns about politicization and being associated with ` tree huggers . ' i helped frame it with the people here in such a way they saw , this is their movement , '' he said . fifth-generation greensburg resident anita hohl joined the staff of greensburg greentown as a web specialist . `` i was pretty green to begin with . i used to get teased about being a tree hugger . now it 's ` the thing ! ' this has really brought us so much closer together . what you can accomplish when just a few people are working toward the same goal is amazing , '' she said . her farming grandparents instilled the virtue of being energy-efficient . `` my grandma always put her clothes on the line , did her own gardening and re-used everything , '' hohl said . hohl and her husband , a daughter , a son , four cats , a dog and two birds are among the greensburg residents in `` femaville , '' a cluster of mobile homes set up as temporary housing . the family hopes to break ground soon for their new house and move in by thanksgiving . although they have made the best of the cramped quarters , she says , there are some challenges . `` it sort of feels like living in a cheap motel ! but it 's a lot better than it could be . it 's nice to have a place to be , '' she said . from the start , the greentown staff knew that getting the business community on board with the green plan was vital . and in rural america , there is no business that 's more of a bedrock than the john deere dealership . in greensburg , that dealership has been in the estes family for four generations . their facility was wiped out by the twister . `` the building was a total loss . and we saved only 13 pieces of machinery out of 220 on the lot , '' kelly estes said . `` the fema guy said he had never seen anything like it . steel twisted into brick , and then the miles per hour needed to pick up combines that weigh 25,000 pounds and move them half a mile in the air , '' he said . kelly and his brother mike decided to rebuild in town to the highest green-building standard . the u.s. green building council establishes a rating system for efficient buildings called leed , or leadership in energy and environmental design . the greensburg facility is aiming for leed platinum , the most demanding standard . there is one wind turbine on their new property , a 100-foot structure designed to generate 5 kilowatts of electricity . it is providing power for the construction site . although `` green '' may be viewed as trendy and new by some , mike estes knows that it is not for show . `` we 're looking at saving money here ; truthfully , we are . we 're running a business . if we ca n't make this make sense , why would we do it ? '' he asked . and he says the non-political approach of the city in encouraging energy efficiency has helped . `` i do n't think it 's red or blue to be green ; i think green is green , and green makes sense . and green saves you green ! '' he said with a laugh . being a model for the world in energy efficiency is a major goal of greensburg greentown . but there is another even more urgent aim : keeping this rural town from disappearing . the lack of jobs in many small towns means that after teenagers graduate from high school , they have to leave to find other opportunities . `` the average age of people living in rural communities is in their 50s , '' wallach said . `` there are very few folks in the communities under that age , because there are just no jobs . families have been split up for decades . '' so in addition to the long-term goal of greensburg 's pre-tornado businesses from leaving , people hope to attract new green trade as well . the city wants to open a biodiesel facility as one of its first green newcomers . another long-term goal is to have 100 percent renewable energy . it is probable that the greatest contribution would come from large wind turbines . `` the timing of all this is , in some ways , almost spooky , '' wallach said . `` it 's like the world was ready for this to happen , for a town to be completely re-imagined . the tragedy was terrible . but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity .

465	johannesburg , south africa -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- white students at a south african university tricked black residence hall workers into eating stew containing urine , prompting a march wednesday in which five people were arrested , university officials said . students protest against a racist video on the campus of free state university in bloemfontein , south africa . the white students made a video of the incident , which they staged in reaction to the university 's efforts to integrate its residences , according to a statement from the university of the free state . the protesters on wednesday included black and white students who later marched to the residence where the video was made and demanded that it be shut down , witnesses said . the video surfaced on tuesday but was made in september , the university said . in the video , white male students at reitz residence are seen encouraging at least three black female housekeepers to participate in what the students call the `` reitz fear factor , '' an apparent reference to the television show in which contestants eat live worms or compete in other feats . watch excerpts of video that sparked outrage '' in one scene from the video , a student mixes what looks like a beef stew in a plastic bowl and adds garlic and other items . then he tells the camera he will add the `` special ingredient . '' the student then urinates into the mixture , which he later stirs up and puts in a microwave . other students can be heard laughing on the tape . the next scene shows a different student urging at least three housekeepers to drink cups full of the stew , saying , `` this is our dorm 's ` fear factor . ' we want to see who has the best ` fear factor . ' '' on the video , the student does not tell the women that there is urine in the mixture . the women , on their knees , spit the stew into buckets after tasting it . some appeared to vomit , but the women also laughed during the incident as the student urged them on . next , the women struggle to run in what appears to be a race . the video is put in slow-motion as the theme from `` chariots of fire '' plays . finally , one of the students awards a large bottle of whiskey to one of the women , telling her she has won the `` fear factor . '' at the end of the video , a message appears on the screen in afrikaans saying , `` that , at the end of the day , is what we think of integration . '' university officials and human rights groups in south africa denounced the video . `` the executive management of the -lsb- university -rsb- condemns this video in the strongest possible terms as a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved , '' said ufs rector frederick fourie in a statement posted on the university 's web site . `` we have immediately started with a most urgent investigation into this matter , '' he added . later wednesday , fourie met with the employees seen in the video and apologized to them , a statement from the university said . counseling is being provided for the workers , it added . the students involved in the video have been identified and will be suspended , fourie said , and charges against the men will be filed with the south african police service . two of the students in the video are still enrolled at the university but had been barred from the campus in bloemfontein , according to the university . two others completed their studies last year . the students seen in the video have not made any public comment since the video surfaced . `` i am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video . i have publicly said several times that the ufs is not a place for racism , '' the rector 's statement said . `` the fact that it is openly linked to the integration process in ufs residences is also most disturbing , '' fourie said . a spokeswoman in free state province for the democratic alliance -- an opposition party which says it puts equal rights for all south africans at the center of its policies -- called the video `` shocking and inhumane . '' `` it looked like they were willing -lsb- participants -rsb- but they did n't know what purpose the video served . ... it was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat , '' said spokeswoman liana van wyk , the south african press association reported . helen zille , the democratic alliance 's leader , wednesday asked the south african human rights commission to conduct an investigation into racial tensions at the university . `` the abhorrent footage of students abusing university workers is a fundamental infringement on the victims ' constitutional right to have their dignity respected and protected , '' zille said in a statement posted on the group 's web site . `` this incident is symptomatic of racial tensions that have been simmering at the campus for some time over the issue of hostel -lsb- residence -rsb- integration , '' she said . fourie acknowledged in his statement that `` the university is going through a difficult time with its efforts to racially integrate its residences and to create a new residence culture based on diversity , respect , human dignity and human rights .

466	longyearbyen , norway -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment tuesday . the inside of one of the vaults at the svalbard global seed vault , on a remote island near the arctic ocean . dubbed the `` doomsday vault , '' the seed bank on a remote island near the arctic ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world 's seed collections , protecting them from a wide range of threats including war , natural disasters , lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management . norwegian musicians performed tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault , located 130 meters -lrb- 427 feet -rrb- inside a frozen mountain . wangari maathai , a kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 nobel peace prize , placed the first seeds inside the vault , followed by other dignitaries . the inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds , with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world . in all , the shipment of seeds secured in the vault tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons , filling 676 boxes . the shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total , ranging from major african and asian food staples like maize , rice , and wheat to european and south american varieties of eggplant , lettuce , barley , and potato , according to the global crop diversity trust , which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds . watch as `` doomsday '' seed vault opens '' eventually the svalbard global seed vault , as it is officially known , will hold as many as 4.5 million distinct samples of seeds -- or some 2 billion seeds in total -- encompassing almost every variety of most important food crops in the world , the global crop diversity trust said . the norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near longyearbyen , in the remote svalbard islands between norway and the north pole . building began last year . the united nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long-term conservation of crop diversity , and countries and foundations provide the funding . `` the seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries , '' said cary fowler , executive director of the trust . `` at these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years . '' the vault 's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside . `` we believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility , '' said magnus bredeli tveiten , project manager for the norwegian government . the vault sits at the end of a 120-meter -lrb- 131-yard -rrb- tunnel blasted inside the mountain . workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees celsius -lrb- just below 0 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area 's natural permafrost and the mountain 's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 c -lrb- 25 f -rrb- . the vault at svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in sussex , england , about an hour outside london . the british vault , called the millennium seed bank , is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants , as opposed to the seeds of crops . paul smith , the leader of the millennium seed bank project , said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops . `` we must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us , '' smith told cnn . the idea for the arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the international treaty on plant genetic resources came into force in 2004 , the norwegian government said . the treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity . svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world . the norwegian government says it has paid 50 million norwegian kroner -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- to build the seed vault . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's becky anderson contributed to this report .

470	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. barack obama said thursday that the most important thing he could achieve as president would be to deal with iraq and the threat of al qaeda in afghanistan while improving `` our influence around the world . '' sen. barack obama , in his first interview since the north carolina and indiana primaries , speaks with wolf blitzer . in his first interview since the north carolina and indiana primaries , obama said he thinks the united states ' influence around the world has been diminishing . `` the world wants to see the united states lead . they 've been disappointed and disillusioned over the last seven , eight years , '' he told cnn 's wolf blitzer in an interview on `` the situation room . '' `` i think there is still a sense everywhere i go that if the united states regains its sense of who it is and our values and our ideals , that we will continue to set the tone for a more peaceful and prosperous world . '' watch the full interview with obama '' obama said he thinks the way the war in iraq has been handled has kept the united states from focusing on key issues like energy policy , global warming and the economy . americans want to succeed , he said , `` but we 're going to have to make some investments and ensure that the dynamism and the innovation of the american people is released . '' `` it 's very hard for us to do that when we 're spending close to $ 200 billion a year in other countries , rebuilding those countries instead of focusing on making ourselves strong , '' he said . obama downplayed headlines and stories , such as the cover of time magazine , that have declared him the democratic presidential nominee . `` i do n't want to be jinxed . we 've still got some work to do , '' he said . watch an analysis of some of obama 's comments '' obama predicted that he and sen. hillary clinton would probably split the remaining contests and said clinton would win the upcoming primary in west virginia by a `` big margin . '' obama won north carolina by a 14-point margin tuesday . clinton squeaked out a win in indiana by 2 points . in the days after those contests , some top democrats have called on clinton to step aside . obama deflected a question about a potential joint ticket with the new york senator , saying it 's too early to start thinking about running mates . `` sen. clinton has shown herself to be an extraordinary candidate . she 's tireless , she 's smart , she 's capable , and so obviously she 'd be on anybody 's short list to be a potential vice presidential candidate , '' he said . `` but it would be presumptuous of me at this point ... to somehow suggest that she should be my running mate . '' watch viewer responses to question : should obama offer clinton the no. 2 spot ? '' terry mcauliffe , a former democratic national committee chairman and a co-chairman of clinton 's campaign , commented thursday on the possibility of a joint ticket . `` i think what she 's interested in being the nominee of the party . ... we 're fighting hard for it . this woman has been working tirelessly through this campaign . ... hillary has earned the right to do whatever she wants to do . '' obama said he 's ready for what would be the next phase if he becomes the nominee : a matchup against sen. john mccain , the presumptive gop candidate . obama said he was offended when mccain said last month , `` it 's very clear who hamas wants to be the next president . '' `` i think it 's disappointing because john mccain always says , ` well , i 'm not going to run that kind of politics , ' and then to engage in that kind of smear i think is unfortunate , particularly since my policy on hamas has been no different than his , '' obama said . `` and so for him to toss out comments like that , i think , is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination . '' when asked to respond to mccain supporters -- such as former massachusetts gov. mitt romney -- who have said obama is not ready to be commander in chief , the senator from illinois said he thinks what people are looking for is `` good judgment . '' `` i think i 've consistently displayed the kind of judgment that the american people are looking for in the next president , '' he said . watch obama say why he 's qualified to be president '' romney responded later on `` the situation room , '' saying `` the truth of the matter is just as i said , that he does n't have a record of accomplishments in the private sector or in the governmental sector ... has n't pushed a major piece of legislation . `` he seems like a charming guy who 's very well-spoken . but in terms of actually having led , actually having accomplished something , actually having a kind of leadership that america needs at a critical time with our economy ... he 's untested . ... frankly , sen. mccain is someone who is tested and very proven , '' he added .

'' but carrion also said he `` kind of understood '' the actions of the group . puerto rico and hawaii , along with guam and the philippines , were annexed into the united states in 1898 after the spanish-american war . guam and puerto rico remain territories of the united states . the philippines gained independence after world war ii , and hawaii became the 50th state in 1959 . although the monarchy was not overthrown until 1893 , its fate effectively was sealed six years earlier when the same group that forced the overthrow imposed a new constitution on king david kalakaua , who was forced to sign it under threat of arms . the document dramatically reduced the authority of the monarchy and instituted voter requirements that limited voting to wealthy businessmen and hawaiian landowners , barring 75 percent of the native hawaiian population and all asians . when queen lili'uokalani ascended the throne after the death of her brother in 1891 , she began work on a new constitution that would have effectively reversed the 1887 document . with the help of john l. stevens , the u.s. minister to hawaii , the elite group that had changed the constitution in 1887 opposed the queen 's actions . two years later , under threat of u.s. troops , she yielded her authority , saying , `` until such time as the government of the united states shall ... undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which i claim as the constitutional sovereign of the hawaiian islands . '' the queen was later imprisoned in iolani palace for eight months for her participation in an attempted 1895 revolt , until she relinquished her claim to the throne in return for her release . she died in 1917 at 79 . in 1993 , the u.s. congress approved , and president clinton signed , an apology to the people of the hawaiian islands . the document `` acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the united states and further acknowledges that the native hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the united states their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands , either through the kingdom of hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum . '' although it was used as a seat of government for decades after the deposition of lili'uokalani , the palace fell into disrepair . when the last of the government office moved out and into new facilities adjacent to the palace in 1969 , restoration work began . it opened to the public in 1978 . e-mail to a friend .

480	kampala , uganda -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a fight between ugandan and libyan presidential guards sparked chaos during a ceremony attended by the heads of state from 11 african nations on wednesday . libyan leader moammar gadhafi and ugandan president yoweri museveni attend the opening of the mosque . several of the guards to the visiting heads of state from kenya , tanzania , burundi , rwanda , mali , somalia , sudan and djibouti sustained serious injuries in the fight , which included punches , kicks and the drawing of guns . no leaders were hurt in the melee , though several were knocked over . several journalists also were caught up in the fracas and suffered injuries or lost their grips on cameras and recorders . the incident occurred at the opening of a massive gadhafi national mosque in kampala , a structure begun by the late ugandan dictator idi amin in 1972 and completed with financing from libya , according to african media reports . minutes after libyan leader moammar gadhafi and his host , ugandan president yoweri museveni , jointly unveiled a plaque to mark the event , the libyan guards pushed away the guards of other delegations at the mosque 's entrance . the ugandan guards -- who had traded hostilities with the predominantly-arab libyan guards at every joint event since gadhafi 's arrival in the country sunday -- reacted with fury and fought back . museveni briefly lost his balance when a hefty libyan guard pushed him to a wall . another libyan guard pushed rwandan president paul kagame , who also lost his balance but was caught by his own guards . the vice president of tanzania was knocked over by fighting guards as he was taking his shoes off to enter the mosque . guards to the rest of the visiting presidents and prime ministers kept their respective leaders out of the fray , with some drawing their guns as the dignitaries looked on in disbelief . some leaders -- notably those from somalia , burundi and djibouti -- were visibly uneasy as guns were drawn on all sides . by the time the fight was over more than six minutes later , about a dozen presidential guards were left bleeding from compound fractures and the libyan and ugandan protocol officials traded bitter accusations of disrespect and racism . `` what are your people up to ? do you want to kill our leader ? '' a libyan protocol official said to his ugandan counterpart . the ugandan official , who declined to be named , shouted back , `` why do think you 're superior ? what makes you think uganda has any ill intention against gadhafi ? '' the ugandan official said museveni 's guards were simply doing their job as security for the host country and had a right to respond when the libyan guards pushed them back . it has taken 36 years to complete the giant mosque on a hill in the heart of kampala . it used to be a colonial fort named after british capt. frederick lugard . the mosque can accommodate as many as 17,000 people at one time , according to the engineers , who call it the largest mosque in sub-saharan africa . many muslims interviewed said the mosque 's opening evoked sweet memories of amin , the deceased dictator . `` it is a great day and thanks be to allah for the completion , '' said salim abdul noor , 39 . `` this should remind us that while amin is demonized as africa 's worst dictator , there are many things he did for this country that successive governments largely depend on , and much of the completed installations and structures like this beautiful mosque was amin 's dream , may allah rest him in peace . '' the swedish vice president of the european islamic conference , adly abu hajar , 57 , said the mosque heals rifts in a religion introduced to uganda in 1844 by arab slave traders . `` i find this complex has brought unity among muslims in uganda . there have been so many factions , but this attraction has brought them together , identifying themselves with a common home . '' the fight prompted a crisis meeting by ugandan security authorities , after which invited diplomats from mainly the european missions in uganda expressed dismay . `` it 's disgrace . it shows there is something wrong yet unknown between the two parties , '' said the head of one european mission in kampala , who declined to be named . the police chief , maj. gen. kale kayihura , and the head of the army , gen. aronda nyakairima , declined to comment on the fight . but capt. edison kwesiga , the spokesman of the ugandan presidential guard brigade , confirmed their hostile relationship with the libyans . `` it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of any visiting head of state . we have to do our job using any means . but our libyan brothers always want us to fail . true , it 's not the first time they come and act as you see , '' kwesiga said . e-mail to a friend .

482	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. hillary clinton received the most votes in two pivotal democratic primary contests tuesday , scoring wins in texas and ohio that were considered critical to keeping alive her white house hopes . sen. hillary clinton is the winner in ohio and texas primaries , but trails in the texas caucuses . with 99 percent of precincts reporting in ohio , clinton had 54 percent of the vote compared to 44 percent for sen. barack obama . the race was closer in texas where , with 99 percent of precincts in , clinton had 51 percent to obama 's 48 percent . a complicated formula in texas that weighs delegates more heavily in highly populated areas and includes a caucus that was still being tallied wednesday afternoon meant the delegate count there remained unclear . obama was leading clinton in the caucus vote 56 percent to 44 percent with 38 percent of the state counted , party officials said . the party will split 67 delegates between the candidates in proportion to the final caucus results . watch an i-report video from a democratic caucus '' a final tally was not expected until thursday afternoon , officials said . regardless , the two wins were crucial for clinton , who would have found it difficult to continue the race if obama won big tuesday . `` for everyone across america who has been counted out but refused to be knocked out , for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up and for everyone who works hard and never gives up , this one is for you , '' clinton said to a cheering crowd in columbus , ohio . watch clinton thank backers '' after a month of losses to obama , clinton had been expected to do well in ohio -- where the blue-collar workers who have consistently supported her throughout the campaign make up a large chunk of the democratic base . but with polls showing the ohio contest neck-and-neck in the days leading up to the primary , clinton got a boost from female voters and those who only recently made up their minds . according to cnn exit polling , 59 percent of the voters in the state 's democratic primary were women . those female voters favored clinton over obama , 58 percent to 40 percent . in the past week , clinton sharpened her attacks on obama -- questioning whether he has enough experience to lead the nation and attempting to cast doubt on his opposition to international trade agreements that many in ohio feel have led to job losses . poll results suggest it may have worked . among those polled , 64 percent of those who decided their vote in the last three days chose clinton . clinton was believed to need strong performances in tuesday 's contests in ohio and texas to halt obama 's momentum in the race and stay alive in the hunt for the 2,025 delegates needed to win the nomination . as early returns were counted tuesday , obama ran a string of consecutive victories to 12 with a lopsided win in vermont . with 99 percent of precincts reporting , he led clinton 59 percent to 39 percent . but clinton snapped that streak in rhode island . with 98 percent of precincts reporting , clinton had taken 58 percent of the vote to obama 's 40 percent . speaking in san antonio , texas , obama told supporters he expected to hold a similar delegate lead over clinton after tuesday 's races to the one he held before . `` we know this -- no matter what happens tonight , we have nearly the same delegate lead we had this morning and we are on the way to winning this nomination , '' he said to cheers and chants of his trademark phrase , `` yes we can . '' watch an excerpt of obama 's speech to supporters '' with texas ' delegates still to be awarded , clinton had picked up 22 delegates after results in ohio , rhode island and vermont were tallied . obama entered the day holding a lead of just over 100 delegates , with 1,369 pledged delegates and superdelegates to clinton 's 1,267 , according to cnn estimates . in ohio , harsh weather and balloting problems stretched the polling well into the evening . with polls slated to close at 7:30 p.m. , state elections officials decided to extend voting until 9 p.m. in northern ohio 's sandusky county . the area was hit by freezing rain for much of the day , and ballot shortages were reported in the cleveland and columbus areas -- also causing the polls to be open until 9 p.m. texas , with its 193 democratic delegates , and ohio , with 141 , were the biggest prizes in tuesday 's contests . there were 15 democratic delegates at stake in vermont and 21 in rhode island . ` texas two-step ' texas ' results may not be as easy to measure as counting votes . in what pundits have been calling the `` texas two-step , '' the state 's democratic party held a primary election , in which 126 delegates were awarded , and a post-election caucus in which another 67 are at stake . it 's possible for the loser of the primary to win more delegates with a strong showing in the caucuses . texas ' method of awarding delegates in the primary -- with more delegates coming from large population centers like houston , dallas and austin -- further complicates the matter . as polling places closed tuesday , texans reportedly lined up in bigger-than-expected numbers for the caucuses -- in some places lining up in parking lots and overflowing buildings where caucuses were held . party officials wednesday said 1.1 million voters participated in the caucuses . a cnn i-reporter in houston said there were hundreds of people at his polling place -- he said he waited more than an hour just to sign in . at an austin caucus , about 800 people showed up -- far outstripping expectations and causing organizers to stand on tables and yell to organize caucus-goers , one voter said . clinton supporters had said a strong performance would keep her campaign alive . weeks ago , former president clinton predicted his wife would need wins in texas and ohio to stay in the race . `` if hillary clinton gets out a small win in ohio and texas , it will be like punxsutawney phil seeing his shadow , '' said political adviser and clinton supporter paul begala , referring to the six more weeks of winter the groundhog is said to predict . the obama campaign , however , said the arithmetic of the delegate count will make it difficult for clinton to overcome obama 's lead . `` they 've had a really bad run and they have to rationalize continuing , '' said obama spokesman david axelrod . `` we 've won more popular votes and more delegates , and they have to give some rationale for staying in this race .

483	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- china 's giant pandas are believed to be safe after monday 's earthquake , but concern is growing over how they will get their next meals . questions remain about whether infrastructure damage will harm the giant pandas ' supply of bamboo . authorities confirmed tuesday that captive animals in two of china 's major panda reserves were alive , according to xinhua , china 's official news agency . the wolong giant panda reserve center in southwest sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas , who were reported safe tuesday . staff and critters at neighboring chengdu panda breeding and research center were also reported safe , according to a spokesperson for the atlanta zoo , which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve . concern arose in the international wildlife community over damage to the animals ' habitat , as authorities continued assessing the scope of damage in the sichuan province . the mountainous , densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild , making it an obvious location for research bases like wolong and chengdu . giant pandas roam the forest in `` open cages '' that are meant to provide them with a safe , natural environment that will prepare them for release . with the safety of the pandas confirmed , the animals ' caregivers are left to determine how resources like food and medical supplies will reach the bases , which contain breeding facilities and triage centers . bamboo , the pandas ' primary source of food , is a major agricultural product in the region , but whether it can be supplied to the pandas despite infrastructure damage is open to question . `` wolong is hard to access under normal conditions , so the heavy road damage makes it even harder , '' said kerry zobor , spokeswoman for the world wildlife fund . zobor said the wwf had confirmed the safety of staff members based in beijing but had not received word on the conditions in wolong . she said the wwf was also concerned about members who had been touring the country when the earthquake struck . the group has not been located . scientists in the united states are hopeful that chinese researchers will adapt to the situation facing them . david wildt with the smithsonian 's national zoological park in washington says scientists in wolong have overcome threats to the giant panda population before . in the late 1990s , the captive giant panda population was in decline , with more animals dying than were born , wildt said . thanks to a collaborative effort with american scientists , the wolong staff was able to reverse the trend . `` our chinese colleagues are very perceptive when it comes to addressing problems , '' said wildt , who has visited wolong many times as part of the smithsonian 's affiliation with the research base . `` because of their efforts , the population is on the rise today . '' wildt said that chinese scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources . `` artificial diets in the form of protein biscuits have been created for giant pandas . they 're not a complete substitute , but they meet the needs of a basic high-fiber diet , '' said wildt , who has worked with two pandas that the smithsonian has on loan from wolong . `` right now , we 're mostly concerned about the staff . if the staff is fine , then the animals will be fine , '' wildt said .

486	belgrade , serbia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. embassy in belgrade is evacuating all nonessential personnel following thursday 's attack on the building by a crowd of protesters , a spokesman for the embassy told cnn friday . serbian riot police stand in front of the damaged u.s. embassy in belgrade on friday . the u.s. ambassador , cameron munter , is staying , officials said . the embassy was closed friday , and a handful of riot police holding shields stood outside the building , its outer walls blackened from fires set the night before and some of its windows smashed . it will remain closed until monday or tuesday so officials can assess the damage , said bill wanlund , the embassy 's spokesman . he said embassy staff were still in a heightened state of alert but there were no specific threats against any staff members . the united states has warned the serbian government that it has a responsibility to protect its assets . a top u.s. diplomat was asked during an interview on cnn if the serbian government `` gets '' the warning . `` they 'd better get it , because they have a fundamental responsibility to protect our diplomats and our embassy and to protect american citizens , '' said undersecretary of state for political affairs r. nicholas burns . `` what happened yesterday in belgrade was absolutely reprehensible . '' watch burns ' angry comments on belgrade attack '' thursday 's violence erupted after demonstrations by thousands of serbs against kosovo 's declaration of independence . the anger directed against the united states and other countries for recognizing the breakaway province as a nation sparked attacks on western embassies and shops by hundreds of people . burns said there was an `` insufficient '' number of security people guarding the u.s. embassy at a demonstration everyone knew would take place . he said security `` melted away '' as `` the mob attacked our embassy . '' `` this kind of thing should not happen in a civilized country . it does n't happen in the united states of america . it does n't happen in most world capitals . so the serb government needs to reflect seriously about the responsibility it has under the vienna convention , '' he said . burns , the third highest ranking diplomat in the state department , said he told the serbian prime minister , vojislav kostunica , and his government that the u.s. `` would hold them personally responsible for the safety of our people . '' `` they assured me that they would have adequate security on the ground today and for every day to come . we will hold them to that commitment , '' burns said . demonstrators only managed to break into one u.s. embassy building , which wanlund said was rarely used by staff . he said the protesters did n't manage to get any documents or embassy materials . only marines and security guards were present at the embassy when the angry mob of about 100 approached the walls . in addition to the u.s. embassy , the protesters attacked other western interests including the embassies of britain and germany , as well as a mcdonald 's restaurant and a nike shop . `` one might understand the emotion , but not the violence , and that 's what the serb government needs to remember , '' burns said . burns , who is stepping down in march , has long been involved in trying to resolve tensions in the former yugoslavia . the situation was complicated by sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence by serbia 's predominantly albanian region of kosovo . kosovo is revered historically by orthodox christian serbs but also is claimed as separate and distinct by its ethnic muslim albanians . the wisdom of recognizing kosovo independence has been questioned by many observers , who say the united states wo n't recognize other unilateral declarations of independence . some opponents of kosovo 's independence say recognition is a bad precedent if it 's unilateral and not done in a bilateral , diplomatic setting . they say it will give others the incentive to stage their own breakaway nations . burns said every situation has its unique set of circumstances , as does kosovo , which was the victim of ethnic cleansing policies by the slobodan milosevic regime in 1999 . nato troops fought serbia in an air war then and pushed serbian forces out of the region . since then kosovo has been run by the united nations and with security supplied by nato forces . e-mail to a friend .

488	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- u.s. border officers found a wire between two fences along the u.s.-mexican border that , when stretched taut , could have seriously harmed or even decapitated border patrol agents , congress was told wednesday . the wire was about 4 feet high when pulled tight , or about neck level for an agent on an atv , officials say . `` it was configured in a way so that , if it was pulled , it would take off the head of a border patrol agent riding in an open car , '' homeland security secretary michael chertoff said at a house budget hearing . the wire was discovered saturday when authorities monitoring a surveillance camera saw two people on the north side of the border east of the san ysidro port of entry , in the san diego sector . border patrol agents sent to the area found a thick metal wire tied to a secondary fence . the wire stretched across the border road and led into mexico through a hole in the primary fence , according to u.s. customs and border protection . when pulled tight , the wire would be about 4 feet high -- about neck level for an agent riding on an all-terrain vehicle , cbp said . officials said they suspected that drug or illegal immigrant smugglers were involved . no arrests were made on either side of the border . the wire was removed , and no injuries or damage took place , cbp said . e-mail to a friend .

'' sen. barack obama and his wife , michelle , celebrate his south carolina win . the illinois senator earned more than twice the vote that rival sen. hillary clinton did , 55 percent to 27 percent , unofficial returns showed . former sen. john edwards was third with 18 percent . `` tonight , the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of south carolina , '' obama said to supporters saturday . watch a recap of obama 's big win '' a win in south carolina was considered crucial for obama , who won iowa but finished second to clinton in new hampshire and nevada . see what the results mean '' `` i did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white south carolina or a black south carolina . i saw south carolina , '' he said . `` the choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders , '' obama said . `` it 's not about rich versus poor ; young versus old ; and it is not about black versus white . `` it 's about the past versus the future . '' watch obama speech . with 99 percent of precincts reporting , obama had 55 percent of the vote . clinton was second with 27 percent , followed by edwards , with 18 percent . obama 's victory capped a heated contest in south carolina , the first democratic primary in the south and the first with a largely african-american electorate . obama , who is hoping to become the the nation 's first african-american president , did well with black voters , who made up about half of saturday 's electorate , according to exit polls . black voters supported the illinois senator by a margin of more than 4-to-1 over his nearest rival , exit polls indicate . among white voters , obama took about a quarter of the vote , with clinton and edwards roughly splitting the remainder , according to exit polls . clinton congratulated obama and said she was excited to move forward to the super tuesday contests on february 5 . `` millions and millions of americans are going to have the chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted , '' she told supporters at tennessee state university . watch clinton speak to supporters '' edwards also looked ahead to the next contests . `` now the three of us move on to february 5 , where millions of americans will cast their vote and help shape the future of this party and help shape the future of america , '' he said . watch edwards rally supporters '' `` our campaign from the very beginning has been about one central thing , and that is to give voice to the millions of americans who have absolutely no voice in this democracy .

'' on january 15 , edwards pledged , `` i 'm in this for the long haul . we 're continuing to accumulate delegates . there 's actually a very narrow margin between sen. obama , sen. clinton and myself on delegates . '' the state democratic party estimated that more than 530,000 democrats turned out for saturday 's primary , as compared with 445,000 voters who showed up to vote last weekend in the state 's republican primary . the democratic numbers topped the gop turnout for the first time since 1992 , when 445,000 republicans turned out to renominate president george h.w. bush . obama attracted more than 290,000 votes -- nearly matching the total turnout of the 2004 democratic primary . `` this is an enormous turnout , '' cnn analyst jeffrey toobin said . `` democrats are wildly motivated in this election . '' as south carolina 's democratic primary voters went to the polls saturday , almost half of them had made up their minds more than a month ago , according to exit polls . in the 2004 primary , nearly a quarter decided either the day of the primary or in the three days prior who they would support , but this year , only 10 percent of this year 's voters waited until saturday to choose . another 10 percent decided only in the last three days , and 32 percent decided in the last month . forty-seven percent made up their minds at least a month ago , more than double the percentage of 2004 . the early exit polls were taken from a sampling of 1,269 voters statewide . following a rough campaign between clinton and obama , the two camps toned down the rhetoric in the past two days , returning to the issues and concentrating their firepower on the republicans rather than on each other . `` i think they -lsb- the republicans -rsb- should be gracious and just say , `` we have messed this thing up so much we are just going to quit and ... we should n't be re-elected , ' but i do n't think that is what they are going to do , '' clinton said . south carolina is the last big test for the democrats before super tuesday , february 5 , when nearly two dozen states will hold either primaries or caucuses -- including such delegate-rich states as california , new york , new jersey and illinois . florida holds its primary on tuesday but no democratic delegates are being awarded there because the national party is penalizing the state for moving its primary up earlier in the year . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's paul steinhauser , bill schneider , peter hamby , alexander mooney , suzanne malveaux and jessica yellin contributed to this report .
490	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- handsome , articulate and lightning fast -- mclaren 's lewis hamilton can now add two more words to his list of qualities : very rich . lewis hamilton will be able to afford a lot more champagne in the future . the briton is set to become one of the most marketable sport stars in the world -- perhaps second only to tiger woods -- and earn more than a billion dollars if he can maintain the buzz created by his first season in formula one , experts say . on sunday he started his second season in perfect fashion , easily winning the australian grand prix in melbourne . the 23-year-old signed a five-year contract with mclaren worth an estimated $ 140m in january . it leaves him lagging along way behind ferrari 's kimi raikkonen , who is paid an estimated $ 50m a year for driving , but it is through endorsements that he stands to reap a greater windfall . stephen cheliotis , chief executive of the centre for brand analysis and uk superbrands and coolbrands councils ' chairman , said hamilton was the most marketable driver because he was a breath of fresh air . he had helped drive up race attendance and television fewer figures dramatically in his first season . `` he is young , mixing with the right people everyday -- rappers , film stars -- and a lot more articulate than kimi raikkonen , '' cheliotis said . `` he is also the first black driver and it does have a bearing , much like tiger woods in golf . he is also the most marketable because he is going to be the best , much like michael schumacher . '' pippa collett , sponsorship consulting 's managing director , said hamilton was certainly the most marketable driver in the short term . his performance meant he was the dominant member of a group of `` young turks '' -- nelson piquet jr , nico rosberg , heikki kovalainen -- who had great potential . collett said in terms of the media hamilton 's performance , friendliness , english speaking background and professionalism were key assets . if he could maintain these he would earn more than schumacher -- the sport 's first billionaire driver . indeed , schumacher set an example which hamilton would be wise to follow . he was the first driver to win personal sponsors after ferrari allowed him to sign a $ 10m annual deal with a german bank to place its logo on his cap . the german also actively pursued the development of his own retail range , which included caps -- he sold hundreds of thousands at $ 30 a pop -- and even a branded vacuum cleaner . collett said schumacher 's manager , willi weber , was very good . `` schumacher was a nice guy but not very charming . however , he was very professional and you knew he would turn up , '' collett said . cheliotis agreed hamilton would earn considerably more than schumacher , and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers . however , there were pitfalls . lewis had already made the mistake of saying he was moving to switzerland to avoid the limelight when it was all about avoiding tax , cheliotis said . `` he said that and then turned up at every awards night for a month . '' cheliotis said appearing arrogant , being caught out by the tabloid press , endorsing a brand and then using another and over selling himself could also damage his value . `` the big danger with someone like hamilton is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion . there is a danger of being one of 50 sponsors and not getting any value . '' collett said hamilton needed to develop his `` life-time brand '' . while raikkonen may not be a media darling he had developed an `` iceman '' image , which was just as important in the long term . english footballer david beckham , whose performance had dropped off , had successfully developed a life-time brand that would out last his playing career . collett said hamilton 's one weakness may be his father , anthony . `` his dad is his manager . your brand positioning is as an individual ... having your dad around too much could affect your brand . '' collett said hamilton would have to be wary of bad press , but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel . `` i think that is part of the glamour ... some of that and continued brilliant performances will make his life very easy .

'' this week , in response to the freedom of information act request filed by cnn on november 6 , ice released 113 official photographs of the party , including all of the deleted photos , which technicians were able to electronically restore . an ice spokeswoman denied the photos were suppressed until after myers ' job was secure , saying ice responded in an `` efficient time frame '' to the foia request . news of the photos ' existence infuriated some members of congress , who said they should have been made aware of them earlier . `` it is too bad that these photos surfaced too late to have dealt with her nomination , perhaps , in a different way , '' said sen. claire mccaskill , d-missouri , who last november put a `` hold '' on myers ' confirmation because of the hubbub . watch what congressmen think about party photos '' myers was confirmed on december 20 . as an assistant secretary of homeland security , she leads ice , the agency charged with enforcing immigration law in the nation 's interior . the agency has more than 15,000 employees , including 6,000 investigators . mccaskill said she believed the photos would have affected the confirmation . `` this is such brutally bad judgment that , to me , it indicates that the leadership of this division is flawed , '' she said . rep. bennie thompson , whose committee oversees ice , said wednesday he is upset both by the photos and by ice 's failure to give the photos to congress in november . `` i was satisfied -lsb- with myers ' explanations and apology -rsb- until i found out that these pictures existed , '' thompson said . an ice spokeswoman denied that there was any intentional effort to mislead congress . `` we had asked that they be destroyed , and as far as we knew , that was the case , '' spokeswoman kelly nantel said . myers was `` frank and honest about every aspect of that situation from the very beginning , '' she said . an estimated 50 to 75 employees attended the october 31 costume party at ice headquarters in the district of columbia . a poster advertising the contest said costumes should be tasteful and `` office appropriate . '' myers declined to talk to cnn wednesday , but in written comments to congress last november , she offered the following account of the incident : . she and two other ice officials served as judges of the costume contest , and she had `` very limited interaction '' with the employee in the prisoner costume , who `` was present at the -lsb- judging -rsb- table for less than half a minute before he moved on . `` i was not aware at the time of the contest that the employee disguised his skin color , '' she wrote . nonetheless , after posing for a photo with the employee , she realized it was inappropriate . `` although i did not know that this individual had disguised his race , i determined that i had made an error in judgment in recognizing an escaped prisoner at this party , '' she wrote , and she instructed her chief of staff to direct the official photographer to delete the photos . in an internal e-mail that was sent at 3:05 p.m. , shortly after the party was to end , the ice public affairs director , wendy burrell , said , `` please make sure that the photos of the most creative -lrb- single male entry -rrb- are destroyed . they may not be used in any publication , web site , compilation disk , you name it . not just not used . please erase all . '' myers said she was `` shocked and horrified '' to learn the next day that the employee had used skin-darkening makeup . the employee was counseled , and myers sent out a note to all agency employees expressing regret over the event , agency spokeswoman kelly nantel said in november . `` it is now clear that , however unintended , a few of the costumes were inappropriate and offensive , '' myers wrote . she reminded employees of their responsibility to complete diversity training and said managers should distribute and discuss ice 's diversity policy statement during staff meetings . the employee who donned the inmate costume was placed on two weeks of administrative leave , counseled by a supervisor and returned to full duty . e-mail to a friend .

493	baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the office of muqtada al-sadr accused iraqi and u.s. forces of attacking sadr city on friday , just hours after the shiite cleric called for calm in the wake of the assassination of one of his top aides in the southern city of najaf . iraqi sadrists march friday in the najaf funeral procession of sayyed riyadh al-nuri , top aide to muqtada al-sadr . witnesses and media in the heavily shiite baghdad neighborhood of sadr city , home to the cleric 's power base in the capital , reported heavy fighting between u.s.-backed iraqi troops and al-sadr 's mehdi army militia . the witnesses said u.s. aircraft had been bombarding the area for hours , and media reported rockets slamming into houses and many casualties . witnesses and al-sadr 's office said mosques were making loudspeaker announcements about mehdi army attacks on u.s. military armored vehicles . u.s. troops working in support of iraqi soldiers killed two snipers , two other men firing rocket-propelled grenades and `` multiple others from a nearby building where soldiers were taking rpg and machine gun fire , '' the u.s. military said in a statement . at the same time -- about 9 p.m. -- at least six roadside bombs damaged vehicles in a u.s. army convoy that was transporting barriers for a group of iraqi army soldiers establishing a checkpoint , the military said . afterward , the military said , the iraqi and u.s. soldiers were attacked by small-arms , machine-gun and rpg fire from buildings overlooking the road . the soldiers fired back at their attackers , killing at least four of them . more explosions from the buildings indicated possible arms and munitions stored there , the military said . but the small-arms attack continued until the u.s. forces fired two rounds from an m1a2 abrams tank , killing two more attackers . not long afterward , the u.s. air force , operating an unmanned aerial vehicle , fired a hellfire missile at three men spotted setting roadside bombs , killing all three . maj. john gossart , executive officer of the american unit involved , said that no u.s. or iraqi troops were seriously hurt . earlier , al-sadr issued remarks about the killing of sayyed riyadh al-nuri , who was shot outside his house in najaf 's adala neighborhood after returning from friday prayers . `` the hands of the occupiers and their collaborators have treacherously reached our beloved martyr sayyed riyadh al-nuri , '' al-sadr wrote in a statement on the web . al-nuri is one of 17 people killed over 24 hours in airstrikes , fighting and attacks in areas wracked in recent weeks by fighting among shiites . the assassination prompted an immediate vehicle ban in the shiite holy city of najaf , anger among mourners and an intensification of fighting in baghdad 's sadr city neighborhood . iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki issued a statement deploring the killing and ordering an investigation . al-sadr issued remarks about the killing in a statement on a web site . spokesman sheikh salah al-obeidi emphasized that the cleric is not accusing anyone in particular of the killing but believes that the killers `` are the ones who are following the occupiers ' steps and do n't want stability for the country . '' but al-obeidi called the killing an `` act of provocation '' after the `` siege of sadr city . '' he was referring to the battles since sunday involving members of al-sadr 's mehdi army militia and iraqi security forces dominated by a rival shiite political movement , the islamic supreme council of iraq . that fighting started with an offensive in basra and spread to other shiite regions , including sadr city and the babil provincial capital of hilla . the al-nuri assassination prompted officials to expand the daily curfew in hilla . police said a ban on all outside movement that usually begins at 11 p.m. and ends at 8 a.m. will instead start at 8:30 p.m. violence continued friday in several places in iraq . suicide bombings killed at least four people -- three of them police -- and wounded 15 , officials said . the first bombing was in ramadi , the provincial capital of the predominantly sunni anbar province west of baghdad , an interior ministry official said . at least three national police officers were killed and five wounded , the official said . the second attack took place at a checkpoint about 20 km -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- north of baiji , according to police , who said the bomber and one other person were killed and 10 were wounded . the casualties were members of a local awakening council who were manning the checkpoint , police said . the suicide bomber was driving a pickup carrying sheep . awakening councils , or sons of iraq , are made up of sunnis who have turned on al qaeda in iraq . also , at least three people were killed and five wounded in a mortar attack on baghdad 's palestine hotel , an interior ministry official said . the palestine hotel -- across the tigris river from the international zone , the heavily guarded seat of u.s. power in baghdad -- is in the path of many of the rockets and mortars aimed at the zone . the u.s. military has blamed iranian-backed shiite militants for recent mortar and rocket attacks in baghdad and international zone , also known as the green zone . unmanned aerial vehicles targeted and killed six suspected insurgents in basra on friday and six `` heavily armed criminals '' in northeastern baghdad on thursday night , the u.s. military said . watch the baghdad drone attack '' the u.s. and iraqi militaries have consistently said they have not been targeting specific groups in their recent battles in shiite areas . iraqi and u.s. government officials say they differentiate between mehdi army members obeying al-sadr 's seven-month cease-fire pledge and `` gangs , '' `` criminals '' or `` outlaws '' who are n't obeying al-sadr 's orders . the intra-shiite fighting in iraq that has killed hundreds of people in the past two weeks has involved two main movements : members of the mehdi army militia loyal to al-sadr , and iraqi security forces dominated by the chief political rival of the sadrists , the islamic supreme council of iraq . many of those security forces had been integrated into police and army units from the council 's badr brigade militia . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's yousif bassil and jomana karadsheh contributed to this report .

'' the red cross board of governors asked for and received everson 's resignation after it `` concluded that the situation reflected poor judgment on mr. everson 's part and diminished his ability to lead the organization in the future , '' the red cross said in a statement on its web site . everson , 53 , said in a written statement that he was leaving the $ 500,000-per-year job `` for personal and family reasons , and deeply regret it is impossible for me to continue in a job so recently undertaken .

'' the board of governors on tuesday appointed mary s. elcano , general counsel and five-year red cross employee , as interim president and ceo . everson had worked in the bush administration from august 2001 -- including serving as commissioner of the internal revenue service -- until he was hired by the red cross . `` this is flabbergasting , that 's all i can say . it 's completely contrary to his public persona that he evidenced while he was at the irs , '' said suzanne ross mcdowell , a washington-based attorney who served on an advisory committee to the irs division that deals with tax-exempt organizations . `` from the standpoint of exempt organizations on the non-profit sector , it 's just another news story that we would rather not see , '' she said . `` it 's got nothing to do with the red cross , '' said ira milstein , a new york lawyer specializing in corporate governance who has worked with the organization and was impressed with everson . `` he was a team player and a good leader . to have him fall off a cliff like this is just sad . '' a search committee has been formed to begin the process of finding everson 's permanent replacement , the organization said . the job has been a challenging one . marsha j. evans resigned as president in 2005 , after the red cross response to hurricane katrina came under fire . four years earlier , bernadine healy quit the post after the organization was criticized for mishandling donations intended for victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks and collecting vast quantities of blood that was not needed and ultimately thrown out . healy told reporters she `` had no choice '' about her resignation . meanwhile , defrancis acknowledged tuesday that , 14 years after a court ordered the agency to improve its collection of blood , it has yet to meet federal safety and quality-control requirements . e-mail to a friend .

498	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the taliban in afghanistan -- whose government was toppled by u.s.-led forces after the september 11 attacks in 2001 -- has strengthened its military and technical capabilities even while suffering heavy combat losses , says a state department report released wednesday . afghan policemen stand wednesday outside the ruins of a house destroyed during clashes with taliban insurgents . `` the taliban-led insurgency remained a capable , determined , and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority , particularly in the pashtun south and east , '' according to the `` country reports on terrorism 2007 . '' the taliban 's information operations have become `` increasingly aggressive and sophisticated , '' and their ability to obtain al qaeda support and recruit soldiers from the taliban base of rural pashtuns is `` undiminished , '' the report says . but new civilian-military counterinsurgency approaches in the east , particularly nangarhar , have begun to yield successes , the report says . the taliban is funding its terror activities with money from supporters in neighboring pakistan and from narcotics trafficking and kidnappings . kidnappings of foreigners have increased , the report says . the group also has increased its use of improvised explosive devices , and suicide bombings have become more frequent and more deadly , it says . quoting u.n.-compiled figures , the state department said terrorists launched about 140 suicide-bomb attacks in 2007 . the number of terror attacks in afghanistan increased from 969 in 2006 to 1,127 last year , and the number of people killed , injured or kidnapped as the result of terrorism rose from 3,557 in 2006 to 4,673 in 2007 , the report says . in the face of attacks by the taliban and related groups on coalition forces and others , afghanistan has struggled to build a stable , democratic government . however , it has taken steps to build strong relationships with neighboring pakistan and address problems such as poverty that help fuel terrorism , the report says . the program for strengthening peace and reconciliation has persuaded more than 5,000 taliban members and other insurgents to stop their lives of violence , it says . the shifting situation in afghanistan prompted the top u.s. military officer to say in early april that he is `` deeply concerned '' about the situation there , and that maintaining troops in iraq is harming overall u.s. military capabilities . `` the taliban is growing bolder , suicide attacks are on the rise , and so is the trade in illegal narcotics , '' said adm. mike mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff . u.s. defense secretary robert gates said the united states needs more troops to hold areas of southern afghanistan -- the region of highest concern -- and to train local army and police personnel . the two men testified before the senate armed services committee . the united states recently sent an additional 3,500 troops to afghanistan , but commanders in the region would like 10,000 to 12,000 more , gates said . he said he doubted nato would make up the difference . although 25 nato allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces , the bulk of the recent fighting in afghanistan has been done by u.s. , canadian , british and dutch troops . canadian troops are based in the southern province of kandahar , once a taliban stronghold . e-mail to a friend .

'' fernandes : no , i knew malaysians very well . you put a price low enough , they 'd risk their lives . i think also when you start a business the most important thing is does the market want it . and i knew the market wanted it . if that 's there , everything is surmountable because people power is strong . stevens : you like to pluck people from all different walks of life , from all different professions . how do you meld them all together ? what 's the philosophy underlying this ? fernandes : well i think , first is that everyone plays a part . there is no hierarchy . everyone is valuable . i make all my senior management carry bags and things so they appreciate that . stevens : do they ? fernandes : oh yes , they do . some try to shirk their duties , but it 's very hard when they see the ceo doing it -- they have to do it . the second is that everyone 's got ability , it 's how you bring the best out of them . and that 's a very motivating thing . if you see someone who 's carrying a bag suddenly flying a plane . that 's a very powerful motivator . you can do all the theory and books and promise people the world but when they see it in reality , boy that 's a powerful thing to see . stevens : when air asia started , you were known to go down , roll up your sleeves , and really get in with your staff at all levels , do you still have time to do that ? fernandes : i have less time , but i still do it . i think it 's fundamental to running my company , because , unless you get down to the floor and see what 's happening , you wo n't make effective decisions . i do it for two reasons . one is , to see what 's going on , and to make sure if i 'm making the right decisions . and the second thing is , i still want to discover these raw diamonds . stevens : what 's the best piece of business advice you 've ever been given ? fernandes : focus and discipline . stay focused and disciplined . stick to a plan , stick to a vision . you change but the vision 's still the same . and that came from conor mccarthy of ryanair . he has taught me about discipline and focus and i think that 's been a really good lesson for me . e-mail to a friend .

'' she said that with her surrender have come new fears about possible retribution from farc loyalists , who consider her a traitor . wearing a red sweatshirt and what appeared to be a diamond earring in her left ear , she said she once believed the farc would rule colombia . `` i once dreamed of that , '' she said . gen. mario montoya , chief of the army , said two colombian air force helicopters were sent sunday to pick up karina and her companion , who had given authorities their general location . `` with this , we have given a confounding strike to the farc structure , '' particularly to front 47 , which at this point is practically dismantled , '' he said . since the killing of rios , 45 members of the group have laid down their arms and accepted a government plan for reinstallation into society , he said . `` we want to send a message to all members of farc who persist in the mountains , '' he said . `` to tell them , what karina has done is the road all the members of farc should go down . if they do n't , we are going to continue combating them . today , more than ever , i invite them to lay down their arms , take the plan . we do n't want them dead . we want them alive .

503	-lrb- gametap.com -rrb- -- everyone wants to be more physically fit , but the toughest thing is finding motivation -- the motivation to get started , the motivation to keep going , the motivation to push yourself to the next level . a man tries out the wii fit at a nintendo launch party in central park , new york city . wii fit does n't try to motivate you with before and after photos . it does n't try to motivate you with testimonials from fitness gurus . it does n't even offer you three easy payments . but it does entice you to get into shape by making working out look like fun . and that it does very well . in fact , wii fit might be some of the most fun you can have by just more or less standing still , which must make it about as mass market friendly as any video game product ever was . wii fit requires a wii , of course , and it comes bundled with a balance board . but the entire setup does n't take up much space , and the board is no eyesore , either . unlike a bathroom scale that 's usually squirreled away in a closet or shoved into the corner of a bathroom , looking at it does n't make you feel guilty . designed to fit in with japanese living rooms , where space is usually at a premium , the balance board is sleek and elegantly designed . ireport.com : send us your wii fit review . it conveys cool asian style with a streamlined appearance . it 's something you would n't mind having in your living room at all . one thing about nintendo : they know how to make hardware that 's rugged but easy on the eyes . getting started with wii fit is a snap , but you might have to get some bad news out of the way first . the balance board connects to the wii through a wi-fi connection . you stand on it and use the wii remote to record your height and age . the balance board then registers your weight . from those figures , wii fit calculates your body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- , a standard metric many doctors use to determine a person 's overall fitness , which you can track over time . oddly , however , there 's no easy way to just use the scale to see your weight without recalculating your bmi each time . the wii fit-ness program is organized into 48 activities divided among four general areas : yoga , aerobics , strength training , and balance games . you can choose to work through all four in one session or just concentrate on one . if you 've never tried yoga before , working through the 15 positions here are as good an introduction as any . all of them are done with at least one foot on the balance board , so wii fit can measure how centered you keep your body . yoga is a great way to stretch muscles and joints out and to work on overall flexibility . as meditative as this physical activity would seem , you 'll feel the burn even before you reach any of the advanced forms . once you 're loosened up a little with yoga , you might move on to aerobics . the majority of these nine activities are basically variations of hula hooping , jogging in place , and simple step aerobics . the one exception is rhythm boxing , which you unlock later on . by turning these aerobic challenges all into minigames , wii fit entices you to keep working on them to earn better scores and ratings . with the hula hoop , for example , you have to stand on the board and grind your hips to keep a virtual hoop twirling . later , you have to `` catch '' tossed hoops , and then keep them all twirling , too . wii fit sets a mellow , steady pace for all its aerobic challenges , but it still manages to make your heart pump . if just the words `` push '' and `` ups '' makes you break out in a sweat , then you 've probably already surmised that strength training contains some of the most physically demanding wii fit workouts . the torso twist and rowing squat are easy , but push-ups , planks , and even the lunges will show you what you 're made of . the push-ups in particular make you work extra hard . you do push-ups with your two hands on the board , but because it 's 17 1/2 inches wide , people over six feet tall or with broad shoulders might find themselves with their hands positioned inside their shoulder width . while it 's certainly a worthwhile goal to build up to , it 's difficult to snap off a set of push-ups from that position . the balance games require you to just apply pressure to the board through your feet . skiing slaloms and ski jumping are fairly straightforward , but you can also walk a tightrope or try to float down a river inside a giant bubble . all of these are simple and fun , and they really do make you aware of how well you maintain good posture and keep your balance . however , they are also short and very limited in the variety of levels and layouts . could you do all these exercises and balance activities right now without wii fit ? sure you could . but would you ? that 's where the wii fit balance board comes in . just like the wii itself , it just looks like something you 'd like to try out . but once you take that first step onto it , you might find yourself on the way to becoming more fit . read about video games . watch video game news . play complete , original console , arcade and pc games - free ! visit gametap.com . copyright : tm & © 2007 turner broadcasting system , inc. . a time warner company , or its licensors . patent pending . all rights reserved . gametap is part of the turner young adult network .
504	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- cristiano ronaldo missed an early penalty as manchester united earned a 0-0 draw in the first leg of the champions league semifinal at barcelona 's nou camp stadium on wednesday night . cristiano ronaldo sent his penalty attempt wide as united failed to take an early lead at the nou camp . the portugal winger , the top scorer in this season 's competition , spurned the chance to net for the 39th time overall this campaign and give united a vital away goal . the 23-year-old hit the stanchion high outside goalkeeper victor valdes ' left-hand post in the third minute after gabriel milito handled his header from a paul scholes corner . it was united 's best chance in a game dominated by the home side , who had the best of possession with some silky moves but failed to find the killer pass in the final third of the pitch . united goalkeeper edwin van der sar made a string of saves , especially in the second half , but was not often seriously tested . barcelona were boosted by the return of argentina forward lionel messi , who started alongside samuel eto'o up front , with thierry henry on the bench after also being cleared following an illness . messi picked out samuel eto'o in the 13th minute only for midfielder scholes -- making his 100th champions league appearance -- to make a vital interception . barcelona pressed forward again in the 21st minute and rafael marquez got clear of his marker but his header failed to trouble van der sar , who was back in the side following a groin injury . then yaya toure showed good skill for the home side and sent a good cross into the area that was turned away by van der sar . ronaldo felt he should have had another penalty in the 30th minute when he was bundled over by marquez after xavi had carelessly lost possession , but swiss referee massimo busacca allowed play to continue . eto'o rattled in a shot after 34 minutes but wes brown -- who passed a late fitness test to replace the ill nemanja vidic in central defense -- made a vital block . brown partnered rio ferdinand , with england midfielder owen hargreaves operating as a makeshift right-back . deco , starting his first game for barcelona after two months out with injuries , then failed to test van der sar with a free-kick in the 38th minute . marquez was booked in the 44th minute after tripping ronaldo as he attempted to surge forward , meaning the mexican is suspended for next tuesday 's second leg at old trafford . ronaldo sent his effort from an acute angle wide of the post . after the break , messi saw his effort blocked in the 47th minute and then van der sar tipped over defender gianluca zambrotta 's long-range effort . messi beat three united players but ferdinand cut out his low cross from the right , then he played in a superb ball for eto'o -- who lashed his shot against the side-netting . deco tested van der sar with a low drive , then the dutchman easily dealt with a 20-yard effort from xavi . barcelona coach frank rijkaard took off messi in the 62nd minute , replacing him with teenager bojan krkic , who scored the winner in the first leg of the quarterfinal against schalke . a foul on the serbian-born spaniard drew a yellow card for hargreaves in the 73rd minute , then united boss alex ferguson bolstered his midfield by bringing on nani for england forward wayne rooney -- who had started up front with carlos tevez . rijkaard responded by replacing deco with henry in the 77th minute , and the french forward forced a scrambled save by van der sar with a long-range shot on 83 . ferguson brought on veteran winger ryan giggs for tevez soon after , then van der sar denied andres iniesta and also dived to comfortably save henry 's free-kick from 35 yards . barcelona continued to press until the final whistle , but still could not create a clear-cut opportunity . e-mail to a friend .
505	tokyo , japan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a u.s. marine pleaded guilty friday to abusive sexual contact with a child under 16 , bringing to a close a criminal case that stoked outrage in japan , a marine spokesman said . protesters turned out in march after the rape allegations surfaced . the marine pleaded guilty to charges friday . staff . sgt. tyrone l. hadnott was sentenced to four years of confinement , said first lt. judd wilson , a marine spokesman in okinawa , japan . the marine corps withdrew several other charges , including rape of a child , kidnapping and making a false official statement , wilson said . japanese police arrested hadnott in february on charges alleging that he raped a 14-year-old junior-high school student . he saw her while riding his motorcycle , offered to give her a ride and later assaulted her at a park , the police said then . the case stirred outrage at the highest levels of the japanese government . prime minister yasuo fukuda deplored the incident as `` unforgivable . '' the japanese foreign ministry lodged an official protest with the u.s. government . and okinawa gov. hirokazu nakaima said the offense `` violates the rights of women '' and that `` this is a crime that we should not accept . '' the japanese authorities released hadnott after the girl withdrew her allegations , but the marine corps conducted its own investigation . the marines charged hadnott with rape of a child , abusive sexual contact , making a false official statement , adultery and kidnapping . more than 40,000 u.s. troops are stationed in japan , most of them on okinawa . the u.s. military presence has at times bred resentment among locals , who have long complained about crime , noise and accidents . anti-american sentiments boiled over in 1995 , after three american servicemen kidnapped and gang-raped a 12-year-old okinawan schoolgirl . two years ago , a u.s. civilian military employee was jailed for nine years for raping two women . the marine corps said in a statement on friday that it does not tolerate sexual assault . `` we remain committed to maintaining an environment that rejects sexual assault and attitudes that promote such behaviors , '' the statement said .
506	new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- police imposed a curfew in jaipur on wednesday , a day after near-simultaneous bomb attacks in the ancient indian city killed at least 63 people and wounded more than 200 . indian women mourn the death of their relatives in the may 13 serial blasts in jaipur . vasundhara raje , chief minister of rajasthan -- the state of which jaipur is the capital -- blamed an `` unnamed international terror group '' for the attack , but said it was too early in the investigation to specify which one . h.g. ragavendhra , jaipur 's superintendent of police , told cnn that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene , and think they were used to carry the explosives . the owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them . police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them . jaipur , known as the `` pink city '' for its rose-colored forts and palaces , is a popular tourist attraction . the majority hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable muslim population . the day-long curfew , authorities said , was meant to prevent `` communal violence . '' it was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation , said jaipur police director kanhaiya lal . also , tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums , he said . home ministry officials suspect the islamic militant group harkat-ul-jihad al-islami -lrb- huji -rrb- of being behind the attacks , according to cnn 's sister network cnn-ibn and the press trust of india . no one has claimed responsibility . in the past , officials have blamed attacks within its borders on `` foreign '' islamic extremist groups fighting against indian rule in the disputed himalayan territory of kashmir . it is a term that is commonly understood to refer to pakistan . kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between india and pakistan . both control parts of the region , which is predominantly muslim . pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks . see the aftermath of the explosions . '' raje told reporters wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state , the western edge of which lies next to pakistan . she also took to task the central government , saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack . furthermore , raje said , the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years . the bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks , she said . on tuesday evening , eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed hindu temple in jaipur 's walled city . the blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters -lrb- 0.3 miles -rrb- of each other . police defused a ninth bomb . the jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in india 's financial capital , mumbai . in july 2006 , more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in mumbai , formerly bombay . in that incident , the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes . both attacks used rdx , one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives , and ammonium nitrate , an oxidizing agent in explosives . and both attacks took place during the evening hours and on tuesdays . the jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to hanuman , the hindu monkey king . nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals . in the mumbai attack , the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour . and authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people . indian officials blamed pakistan 's intelligence services and a pakistan-based militant group , lashkar-e-tayyiba , for the attack . pakistan , which banned lashkar-e-tayyiba in 2002 , denied any involvement . the jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack : the use of bicycles . just as on tuesday , assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western indian city of malegaon in september 2006 . at least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion , which took place on a friday -- when the mosque is filled with muslim worshippers . that attack was also blamed lashkar-e-tayyiba . authorities have not connected the jaipur blast to any previous attacks . huji -- or the movement of islamic holy war -- is considered a terrorist organization by the united states . it is banned in neighboring bangladesh , where it is accused of carrying out several attacks , including a foiled plot to kill the country 's former prime minister sheikh hasina in 2000 . and it has been blamed for several attacks inside india , including one at the american center in calcutta that killed five policemen in 2002 . india ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common , the u.s. state department said . `` the conflict in jammu and kashmir , attacks by extreme leftist naxalites and maoists in eastern and central india , assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states , and terrorist strikes nationwide by islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year , '' the agency said . cnn 's tess eastment and saeed ahmed contributed to this report .

508	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- al qaeda is still operating within pakistan 's mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan , and the united states lacks a `` comprehensive '' plan for meeting its national security goals there , said a u.s. government study released thursday . a pakistani policeman watches over a border area in february 2008 . despite the united states providing $ 10.5 billion in military and economic aid to pakistan , a key u.s. ally , the government accountability office said it `` found broad agreement ... that al qaeda had regenerated its ability to attack the united states and had succeeded in establishing a safe haven '' in pakistan 's federally administrated tribal areas . of the $ 10.5 billion in u.s. aid , more than half -- $ 5.8 billion -- was specifically provided for the tribal region , the gao said . furthermore , the report said , `` no comprehensive plan for meeting u.s. national security goals in fata has been developed , as stipulated by the national security strategy for combating terrorism -lsb- in 2003 -rsb- , called for by an independent commission -lsb- in 2004 -rsb- and mandated by congressional legislation -lsb- in 2007 -rsb- . '' `` our report does not state that the u.s. lacks agency-specific plans ; rather , we found that there was no comprehensive plan that integrated the combined capabilities of defense , state , usaid -lsb- u.s. agency for international development -rsb- , the intelligence community , '' gao said . after the september 11 terrorist attacks , u.s. officials said intelligence indicated that osama bin laden and other senior al qaeda leaders , who had been based in afghanistan before the attacks on new york and washington , were operating in the tribal region . pakistani president pervez musharraf has denied that claim and has said that u.s. military missions there would violate pakistan 's sovereignty . so , since 2002 , the united states has `` relied principally on the pakistan military to address u.s. national security goals '' in that region , the gao report said . of the $ 5.8 billion the united states provided for aid in the tribal region , 96 percent of it reimbursed pakistan for military operations there , the agency said . two of the eight lawmakers who commissioned the gao report , democratic sens. tom harkin of iowa and bob menendez of new jersey , said it indicated a failing on the part of the bush administration . `` the bush administration has had six years to come up with a plan to get osama bin laden and his group , but it is still flying by the seat of its pants , '' menendez said in a statement . `` we 've dumped 10 billion american taxpayer dollars into pakistan with the expectation that the terrorists will be hunted down and smoked out , but al qaeda has been allowed to rejuvenate in the area that is supposed to be locked down , '' he said . harkin called the report 's findings `` appalling . '' `` the white house must propose a strategic policy in this area and follow it , especially when we have this new opportunity to forge a fresh strategic relationship with the new civilian government in pakistan , '' he said in a statement . the defense department said it agreed with the report 's findings , according to letters attached at the end of the gao report , but the state department disagreed with them , saying there was a comprehensive plan in place . a letter from kathleen turner , a spokeswoman for the office of the director of national intelligence , said that office and the national counterterrorism center concurred with the report 's assessment that the united states has not met its national security goals in the tribal region but maintained that there was a plan in place . usaid said that it generally agreed with the report 's recommendation for a comprehensive plan but that work in the tribal areas should be guided by the pakistani government 's own fata sustainable development plan from 2006 . e-mail to a friend .
509	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it 's midnight on the streets of atlanta , and bar owner rufus terrill patrols his neighborhood with a rolling crime fighter of his own creation . meet `` bum-bot , '' as terrill describes it ; others in his neighborhood call it simply , `` robocop . '' this former bbq smoker is armed with a water gun to chase off bums and drug dealers in downtown atlanta . it 's a barbecue smoker mounted on a three-wheeled scooter , and armed with an infrared camera , spotlight , loudspeaker and aluminum water cannon that shoots a stream of icy water about 20 feet . operated by remote control , the robot spotlights trespassers on property down the street from his bar , o'terrill 's . using a walkie-talkie , terrill belts out through the robot 's loudspeaker , `` that 's private property . you guys need to get out of here . '' terrill is chasing out unsavory-looking characters from a street corner that resembles a drug dealer 's dream at night . more than 20 suspicious people were seen huddling in the dark in the front driveway and side parking lot on this night . some were seen openly making drug deals . watch `` bum-bot '' in action '' but during the day , it 's where young children frolic on a nearby playground at a the beacon of light daycare center in downtown atlanta . it has become a nightmare for day care operator lydia meredith . `` this whole square is enveloped with homeless people and drug dealers , defecating , urinating , prostituting -- the whole nine yards . and the overflow of that behavior , we get to cleanup every morning , '' she says . meredith says people often toss used syringes and condoms onto the playground . terrill , an engineer by trade , is also a board member at the day care center . tired of cleaning up after the shady characters , he decided to take action . that 's when he built his downtown darth vader of sorts . `` he 's a neighborhood vigilante , '' says meredith , `` and when he came up with this -- you know , i call it robocop -- i said , ` praise god .

'' anita beatty , the director of the shelter , is suspicious of the barbecue-smoker robot . `` i just think the whole ` robocop ' spraying people is a little freaky . we really need some police protection in this neighborhood . i think it 's confusing the issue . i think the issue is homeless people . they are being confused with the folks who prey on them and sell them drugs , '' she says . atlanta police patrol the area , but say it 's difficult to stay on top of the large number of people who roam the streets in the area late at night . police major lane hagin says the robot is definitely a different crime-fighting idea . `` there 's no problem with the robot going up and down the street or being visible or any of the other things it does -- with the exception of spraying water on people . '' hagin adds , `` then , it becomes an assault no matter where it happens . '' so far no one has filed charges against terrill or the robot . but one homeless man who declined to give his name followed terrill and his robot down the street and laughingly told him , `` i know about you . i can sue you for assault . '' terrill says he 's not hurting anyone and often sprays the water to the side of loiterers as a ploy to get them to move on . he 's also not about to back down . `` if you 're throwing condoms out on the side of the playground , if you 're throwing needles , you 're throwing crack pipes out there , i 'm not going to let those kids be out there like that . i 'm going to stop you . '' terrill bought his bar four years ago knowing nothing about the restaurant business . he ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of georgia in 2006 . he 's had ongoing problems with people breaking into his bar and stealing things , but it was the day care center problems that spurred him on to create the robot . some of terrill 's bar patrons say they 've seen a difference in the neighborhood . susanne coe lives nearby . `` i 've seen a marked change simply with this robot that does n't have any power of arrest . it does scare people and to be honest with you i 'm grateful for it , '' she says . on this night , as terrill and his robot make their way to the street corner , he shines the robot 's spotlight on the parking lot of the daycare center . one by one , the shadowy figures stand up , walk away and saunter down the street . `` ninety-nine percent of the time , when i go up there and once i turn the spotlight on and i talk to them through the speaker , they leave , '' he says . e-mail to a friend .
510	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- before monday , eliot spitzer was a rising star in the democratic party -- his squeaky-clean image as a corruption buster led to his being mentioned as a potential vice-presidential candidate and possibly even a future white house contender . new york gov. eliot spitzer arrives with his wife monday for a press conference . now , after federal investigators have linked the new york governor to a top-dollar prostitution ring , political advisers are split over whether spitzer has any political future at all . `` there 's no way he can survive it , '' said ed rollins , a republican political consultant and adviser to former presidential candidate mike huckabee . `` all the facts are n't out there , but as they 're being reported , there 's no way you can survive . `` not only is he a hypocrite , he may also end up being a charged felon .

'' but james carville , a cnn political analyst and onetime adviser to former president bill clinton , said spitzer could hold on to his position if the scandal remains strictly about sex -- or if it 's revealed that his political enemies were responsible for leaking the story . carville mentioned other high-profile politicians who have weathered sex scandals , including republican sen. larry craig of idaho , who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after his arrest in a men 's room sex sting , and his own former client , president clinton . `` all of us remember the monica lewinsky scandal and the immediate rush to judgment , '' he said . `` a lot of people said , ` how could bill clinton survive a scandal like that ?

515	dallas , texas -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- arizona sen. john mccain , whose white house aspirations went into a nose dive last summer , clinched the republican party 's presidential nomination tuesday night with a sweep of gop contests in four states . `` i am very , very grateful and pleased to note that tonight , my friends , we have won enough delegates to claim with confidence , humility and a great sense of responsibility , that i will be the republican nominee for president of the united states , '' mccain told supporters in texas . cnn estimates that mccain has amassed 1,195 delegates to the gop 's september convention in minneapolis-st . paul , minnesota , four more than the 1,191 needed to claim the party 's nomination . `` now , we begin the most important part of our campaign : to make a respectful , determined and convincing case to the american people that our campaign and my election as president , given the alternative presented by our friends in the other party , is in the best interest in the country that we love , '' mccain said . `` the big battle 's to come , '' he said . `` i do not underestimate the significance nor the size of the challenge .

'' both clinton , the new york senator and former first lady , and obama , the first-term senator from illinois , called mccain on tuesday night , campaign officials said . obama told mccain he looks forward to running against him in the fall , campaign spokeswoman jennifer psaki said . mccain is slated to go to the white house on wednesday to receive the endorsement of president bush , according to two republican sources . the arizona senator 's campaign -- his second run for the white house -- was largely written off last summer amid outspoken opposition from the party 's conservative base , a major staff shakeup and disappointing fundraising . but the former navy pilot and vietnam prisoner of war rebounded with wins in january 's primaries in new hampshire and south carolina , the state where his first presidential bid foundered . `` there were times , obviously , when my political campaign was not viewed as the most viable in america , as you probably know , '' he told reporters in san antonio earlier tuesday . `` in fact , i was reminded of the words of chairman mao , who said it 's always darkest before it 's totally black . '' mccain 's fortunes also rebounded as u.s. commanders in iraq credited the 2007 launch of a campaign to pacify baghdad and its surrounding provinces with a sharp decline in american and iraqi casualties . the senator had been one of the most outspoken advocates of the shift and has blasted his potential democratic rivals for calling for the withdrawal of u.s. combat troops from the widely unpopular war . `` this is a man with a lot of trials in his life , '' said former education secretary william bennett , a cnn contributor . `` he 's had a lot of downs ; he 's been up , and this is a big up .

'' in 2000 , mccain upset then-texas gov. george w. bush in the new hampshire primary by touting `` straight talk '' and his record as a republican maverick . bush came back in south carolina amid a divisive and bitter campaign that left mccain denouncing leaders of the party 's religious conservative wing as `` agents of intolerance , '' and bush went on to win the presidency . since then , mccain has enraged conservative leaders by opposing bush 's signature tax cuts , co-sponsoring the campaign finance reform law that now bears his name and supporting a controversial white house-backed plan to offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants . but their support was spread among a fractured gop field , and their main standard-bearer , former massachusetts gov. mitt romney , quit the race after a disappointing showing in february 's super tuesday primaries . exit polls in texas and ohio found that about three-quarters of republicans would be satisfied with mccain as their nominee , however . those surveys found that the economy was the top issue for gop voters in both states -- and by a wide margin in ohio , which has seen a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs in the past decade . although national security issues are a strong suit for mccain , castellanos said he might need some help if a weakening economy is the central issue in november . `` it 's never been sen. mccain 's strength , '' castellanos said . he said mccain would need to make the case that `` i 'm going to grow this economy ; barack or hillary , they 're going to grow government .

516	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- we all want to live forever . but , chances are , you 'd rather forego a legacy altogether than have your name be synonymous with a goofy flub like a spoonerism or a dim-witted word like `` dunce . '' you can find a saint under tawdry in the dictionary . for the following eponyms , we ask : did these word-inspiring folks really deserve their drag through the linguistic mud ? 1 . dunce . dictionaries do n't play fair , and john duns scotus is proof . the 13th/14th-century thinker , whose writings synthesized christian theology and aristotle 's philosophy , was considerably less dumb than a brick . unfortunately for scotus , subsequent theologians took a dim view of all those who championed his viewpoint . these `` scotists , '' `` dunsmen , '' or `` dunses '' were considered hairsplitting meatheads and , eventually , just `` dunces . '' 2 . -lrb- slipping a -rrb- mickey . when you have to drug somebody against their will -lrb- hey , you got ta do what you got ta do -rrb- , it just would n't sound right to slip 'em a ricardo , a bjorn , or an evelyn . it 's got ta be a mickey . at the turn of the 20th century , mickey finn was a chicago saloon owner in one of the seediest parts of town -- and he fit right in . finn was known for serving `` mickey finn specials , '' which probably included chloral hydrate , a heavy sedative . after targeted customers passed out , finn would haul them into his `` operating room '' and liberate them of all valuables -lrb- including shoes -rrb- . never a host of the year candidate , this mickey seems to have thoroughly earned his legacy , so do n't hesitate to use it the next time you drug and rob your own customers . 3 . spoonerism . reverend william archibald spooner -lrb- 1844 -- 1930 -rrb- was famous for his muddled one-liners . and though it 's hard to know which ones he actually said , lines such as `` i have a half-warmed fish '' and `` yes indeed , the lord is a shoving leopard '' still prove that the sound-switching flub is pretty charming as far as mistakes go . the spoonerism has even been used as a literary technique by poets and fiction writers , giving spooner little reason to roll over -- or otherwise inarticulately protest -- in his grave . 4 . lynch . although several lynches -lrb- not including david -rrb- have been investigated by inquisitive etymologists , virginia native charles lynch -lrb- 1736 -- 1796 -rrb- is most likely the man behind the murderous word . lynch was a patriot , a planter , and a judge . but when he headed a vigilante court to punish tories -lrb- british loyalists -rrb- during the american revolution , he decided to play the roles of jury and executioner , too . lynch has more than earned his besmirched name . in fact , he did half the besmirching himself by egotistically referring to his actions as `` lynch law '' and `` lynching . '' 5 . shrapnel . while battling napoleon 's army , english general henry shrapnel -lrb- 1761 -- 1842 -rrb- noticed that original-flavor cannonballs just were n't massacring enough enemies for his liking . so , to get more shebang for his shilling , he filled the cannonballs with bullets and exploding charges . these `` shrapnel shells , '' or `` shrapnel-barrages , '' were pretty darn effective , and later designs proved even more successful in world war i. shrapnel did n't get much credit for the `` innovation '' during his lifetime , but he ultimately contributed to enough death and misery that he pretty much deserves to be synonymous with a violent , metallic byproduct of combat . 6 . draconian . a lexis-nexis news search shows that folks are still talking about `` draconian policies , '' `` draconian penalties , '' and , most frighteningly , `` draconian sex rules . '' though athenian lawgiver draco is not entirely confirmed to have existed , if he were real , then around 621 b.c.e. , he instituted two time-honored traditions : 1 -rrb- writing laws down and 2 -rrb- making laws that were batcrap-insane . they include ascribing the death penalty to such atrocities as being lazy , whizzing in an alley , and stealing an apple . apparently , he justified his measures with a sort of non-logic along the lines of , `` jaywalkers deserve to die , and i ca n't do anything worse to mass murderers . so what 're you gon na do ? '' 7 . boycott . in a nutshell ? boycott got boycotted . charles cunningham boycott -lrb- 1832 -- 1897 -rrb- was a retired english army captain who claimed his unwanted fame in 1880 when the irish land league decided to punish him for not lowering his rents . this then-new strategy , which was a mere paragraph in the russian-novel-size saga of irish land reform , was a kind of systematic shunning in which boycott was cut off from servants , supplies , mail , and lifestyle free of death threats . he might have been an evil landlord , but if boycott could see just how successful his name became , he 'd probably be a very sad , regretful , evil landlord . 8 . tawdry . the story of st. audrey -lrb- also known as st. etheldreda -rrb- is a classic example of how bad names happen to good people . st. audrey was the daughter of the king of east anglia -lrb- then the norfolk section of anglo-saxon england -rrb- , who lived a monastery-founding , self-abdicating life . but , when she died of the plague in 679 , she was sporting a pretty nasty-looking tumor on her neck , which gossipmongers blamed on her penchant for wearing audacious necklaces in her youth . after her death , silk scarves called `` st. audrey laces '' were sold in her honor at ely 's annual st. audrey 's fair . then the british tendency for dropping letters and syllables took over , and audrey became `` tawdry . '' it was a short trip from there to the dictionary , and tawdry has been synonymous with gaudy ever since . 9 . chauvinism . nicolas chauvin was an early 19th -- century french soldier who was so patriotic and nationalistic , he gave patriotism and nationalism a bad name -- or at least a new name . a slave to the cult of napoleon , chauvin shed his fair share of blood for the emperor . how did napoleon show his appreciation ? by giving chauvin a ceremonial saber , a ribbon , and a pittance of a pension . later , however , french dramatists began basing über-patriotic characters on chauvin , which paved the way for the soldier 's ultimate reward : a dubious spot in the english language . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

'' roberts : what do you say to people who are in this budget crunch of trying to fill up the family car ? hofmeister : i say we need more gas to be produced in this country . i 've been saying that for three years , ever since i took this position -lsb- as president of shell -rsb- . if the u.s. set a goal to produce 2 to 3 million barrels more a day in this country , we would send a shock around the world that would immediately say to the speculators , hey , u.s. is serious . president -lsb- bush -rsb- said something yesterday about this . i did n't hear him , but i think that 's good news . but we should set a specific target . the presidential candidates should be out there on the postings saying let 's increase domestic production by 2 to 3 million barrels a day . that would be something that would put money back into this country , jobs back into this country , and it would bring more supply toward the americans who need it . roberts : the president is advocating more drilling on u.s. territory . is n't it true that globally we 're starting to reach a peak in production and that within maybe a decade or two oil production will begin to decrease ? hofmeister : well , i think there is some argument -lsb- that -rsb- with convenient , easy oil we will peak sometime in the next decade . i think shell sees that coming , but in terms of total oil supply to the world , we 're a long way from reaching peak oil because it does n't take into account unconventional oil . i think the president brings up a good point in that we could , we have the available domestic supplies off the coast of alaska as well as -lsb- the alaska national wildlife refuge -rsb- . shell has won $ 2 billion worth of high bids for the chukchi sea -- that 's a few years off before we could begin production . but let 's remember there 's more than 100 billion barrels of untouched oil and gas in this country that is subject to a 30-year moratorium . now , there 's only one body in this country that can set a 30-year moratorium , and that 's the u.s. government . roberts : sen. hillary clinton wants to slap you with a 50 percent tax on what she calls windfall profit , profit above a certain level . is that a good idea ? hofmeister : look at our revenues and our income for the last quarter . if we had made $ 7.8 million on $ 114 million of revenue , nobody would call that excessive , because that 's 7 1/2 percent . we made $ 7.8 billion profit on $ 114 billion revenue -- same 7 1/2 percent . so to me that is not an excessive number when banks and pharmaceuticals and it companies earn a whole lot more . watch hofmeister defend shell 's profits '' roberts : would it hurt you if she put in place this tax on the windfall profits ? hofmeister : sure it would . it would slow down investment . taxing the oil companies was tried in the '80s . it drove us to do imports , which is exactly the problem we have today . roberts : where is the top of all this ? how high can the price of a barrel of oil go ? how high will the cost of a gallon of gasoline go ? hofmeister : i heard somebody say the other day it 's as long as a piece of string . we do n't know . roberts : the president of opec said $ 200 a barrel . hofmeister : yeah , well , there are some countries out there subsidizing the cost of their energy to their consumers and industries to compete with america -- or against america -- because they think america wo n't solve the problem . roberts : you 're saying you have no idea where the top is . hofmeister : we do n't know . but we should produce more oil in this country . e-mail to a friend .
520	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- austrian investigators monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where josef fritzl kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years , along with three of their children . josef fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children . investigators believe fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978 , shortly after , according to his daughter , he began raping her at age 11 or 12 , said police spokesman franz polzer . the 73-year-old austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year , and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- polzer said . it took fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition , polzer said . investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison , which was blocked by a 500-kilogram -lrb- 1,100-pound -rrb- steel and concrete door that fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance , polzer said . fritzl , who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar , had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison . `` you would have to open up a total of eight doors , and ... -lrb- for the -rrb- last door which would go into this space -lrb- where the family was imprisoned -rrb- , you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus , '' polzer said . `` we will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we have n't discovered yet , and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting . '' fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter , elisabeth , captive in the dungeon under the fritzl home for decades , repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived . three of the children were adopted by josef fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep . the story of the family 's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago , when one of the children still in the dungeon , 19-year-old kerstin fritzl , fell seriously ill with convulsions . the father agreed to take her to a hospital , the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers . dr. albert reiter , who is treating kerstin , said monday that while her condition is still `` grave , '' it `` has improved somewhat . '' `` she has become more stable , but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help , '' reiter said , noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation . elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother , rosemarie , who police say knew nothing about the basement prison . they were also reunited with the three children that josef had taken from elisabeth . the reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic , where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic 's chief doctor . `` the mother and the smallest child have , in just the last couple of days , increased their sensitivity to light , '' dr. berthold kepplinger said . `` so we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses . '' five-year-old felix is `` getting more and more lively , '' kepplinger said . `` he 's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air , the light , and the food -- all of these things are helping them , '' he said . `` slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal -lrb- shade -rrb- . '' he also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family . kepplinger praised elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity . he said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family , and the children make their beds . however , he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in fritzl 's home . he said the mother , elisabeth , takes breaks and naps several times a day . the health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying , kepplinger said . kepplinger said the children , after being confined to a small space their entire lives , are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces . initially the dungeon where fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters . in 1993 , around the time elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child , fritzl decided to add to the dungeon , building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters . on wednesday or thursday , prosecution authorities will attempt to question fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession , state prosecutor gerhard sedlacek said . a warden at the st. poelten jail , where fritzl is being held , told cnn that fritzl appears to be doing well , but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained . e-mail to a friend .
521	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. barack obama raised more than $ 40 million from more than 442,000 donors in march , his presidential campaign announced thursday . sen. barack obama greets campaign volunteers during a stop in philadelphia , pennsylvania , wednesday . more than 218,000 of the donors were giving for the first time , the campaign said . the figures are estimates , a campaign spokesman said . `` we 're still calculating . '' sources in sen. hillary clinton 's campaign said the new york senator raised $ 20 million in march . impressive as the $ 40 million figure is , it is well below the $ 55 million obama raised in february . clinton , obama 's rival for the democratic nomination , raised about $ 35 million in february . political analysts say this kind of fundraising power catches the attention of voters . `` they add to the so-called ` bandwagon effect ' -- the sense that obama is building , that he 's going to be the nominee , '' said stu rothenberg of the rothenberg political report . with its march totals , the obama campaign has raised approximately $ 234 million , which surpasses the democratic record of $ 215 million that 2004 nominee sen. john kerry raised in that presidential primary season . obama is $ 25 million shy of president bush 's presidential primary fundraising record of $ 259 million , set in his uncontested campaign in 2004 . obama raised $ 194 million through the end of february . official fundraising tallies for march are due to the federal election commission by april 20 . clinton raised $ 156 million through the end of february . the clinton campaign said thursday morning it would not release march figures until required to file its fec report , two days before the critical pennsylvania primary april 22 . but later , campaign sources provided the figures , which show march to be clinton 's second-highest fund-raising month for the campaign . a clinton spokesman downplayed the importance of obama 's fundraising total . `` we knew that he was going to out-raise us . he has out-raised us for the last several months , '' howard wolfson said after obama 's figures were released . `` we will have the resources that we need to compete and be successful in the upcoming primary states . '' wolfson also said he expected clinton 's tax returns to be released soon . clinton pledged march 25 she would release her returns within a week . sen. john mccain , the expected republican nominee , raised $ 11 million in february . he has not announced his march total . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's rebecca sinderbrand and rob yoon contributed to this report .

'' without a basement , she hunkered down and hoped for the best . but wise fared well compared with her neighbors in this historic neighborhood , which has gone from crime-ridden to cool in recent years . a few blocks down , a woman named rebecca -- too distraught to speak with a reporter -- carried what belongings she had left out of her rental home , which had been split in half by a giant oak tree . watch residents describe the storm 's quick arrival '' she was n't at home at the time , her landlord mark rogers told cnn , which was a good thing for her safety . but in the early morning hours , looters got there before she had and took almost everything . looting was a problem throughout the neighborhood , many said . see photos of the damage '' a few doors down from her , pastor richard davis stared up at the tire-size hole in the roof of his eastside christian community pentecostal church . he has been preaching in its single room for 10 years . `` yes ... well , that is something is n't it ?

'' he plans to give a sermon on palm sunday and ask his parishioners to pray hard that lack of insurance wo n't force him to close his doors . steven and laura powell , thinking they were in store for a short lightning storm , were startled by the storm 's quick escalation . they were frightened when they spotted the storm beginning to circulate in the distance from their tiny home , and rushed to scoop up their sleeping 5-week-old audrey . bundled in a soft pink onesie , audrey was still sleeping saturday morning as her parents walked the neighborhood , amazed that their home had not been damaged -- and that their daughter had snoozed through the entire ordeal . `` i just put myself on top of -lsb- laura -rsb- and the baby and we got under the strongest beam in the house , '' said steven powell . `` i thought that if a tree came crashing through , i 'd take the brunt of it . '' cabbagetown 's houses were built for the workers at the local fulton cotton mill . the mill closed and the neighborhood slid into decay . the renaissance of cabbagetown began when the mill buildings were converted to the trendy fulton cotton mill lofts and the artists and urban pioneers moved in . in addition to hitting the houses , friday night 's tornado seriously damaged the top floor of the lofts . remarkably , nobody was hurt . cabbagetown residents remember when the under-construction lofts survived a five-alarm fire in 1999 -- and say they plan to rebuild and survive this disaster as well . e-mail to a friend .
523	charleston , south carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. john kerry on thursday endorsed sen. barack obama for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination , saying the senator from illinois is a `` candidate to bring change to our country . '' `` barack obama is n't just going to break the mold , '' said kerry , the democratic presidential candidate four years ago . `` together , we are going to shatter it into a million pieces . '' the senator from massachusetts made the announcement in front of an enthusiastic crowd in charleston , south carolina , 16 days ahead of the state 's democratic primary . kerry said he was stirred by the way obama `` eloquently reminded us of the fact that our true genius is faith in simple dreams and insistence on small miracles . '' watch kerry explain why he 's picking obama '' the endorsement could be seen as a blow to former sen. john edwards , who was kerry 's running mate in the 2004 election . edwards also is vying for the democratic presidential nomination this year . the endorsement should n't come as a surprise to edwards , who was publicly critical of kerry 's campaign after the earlier election . following news of the endorsement , edwards released a statement saying he respects kerry 's decision . `` when we were running against each other and on the same ticket , john and i agreed on many issues , '' edwards said . `` i continue to believe that this election is about the future , not the past , and that the country needs a president who will fight aggressively to end the status quo and change the washington system and to give voice to all of those whose voices are ignored in the corridors of power . '' kerry made an oblique reference to the other candidates in the race `` with whom i have worked and who i respect '' in his speech thursday . `` they are terrific public servants , and each of them could be president tomorrow , and each would fight to take this country in the right direction , but i believe that more than anyone else , barack obama can help our country turn the page and get america moving by uniting and ending the division that we have faced , '' he said . a source suggested senator 's support for obama will be a big boost because kerry `` remains one of the most popular figures in the democratic party and -lsb- has -rsb- an e-mail list with millions of addresses .

524	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a member of the group dubbed the `` jena 6 '' is facing misdemeanor assault charges after a fight at his texas high school wednesday , police said thursday . bryant purvis was arrested after a fight wednesday at his texas high school , police said . bryant purvis , 19 , was arrested after the incident at hebron high school in carrollton , texas . carrollton police sgt. john singleton told cnn the altercation does not appear to be racially motivated . school officials contacted police about the fight wednesday morning . an 18-year-old student told authorities two males approached him and asked if he had flattened the tires of `` their homeboy 's '' car , according to an affidavit supporting the arrest warrant . the student said he did n't , but the two told him they did n't believe him and walked away . purvis , he said , approached him from behind immediately afterward , then grabbed him with one hand and began to choke him . `` purvis continued to choke -lsb- the student -rsb- and told him , ` do n't you ever mess with my car again , ' '' the affidavit said . `` purvis then pushed his head into the seating area of the bench , '' causing the student to strike his left eye , then walked away . the affidavit said that in a written statement , purvis wrote , `` i walked over to him and grabbed him by his neck , then told him not to mess with my car anymore , then i left . '' police reported the student had marks on his neck and bruising on his eye . a municipal judge set purvis ' bond at $ 1,000 , and he was transferred to the denton county detention facility , singleton said . purvis is one of six former students in jena , louisiana , accused of being involved in the beating of a white student . he initially was charged with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy , but charges against him were reduced in november to second-degree aggravated battery . he is awaiting trial in that case . civil rights leaders martin luther king iii and al sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in september to protest how authorities handled the cases against purvis and the five others accused in the december 2006 beating of fellow student justin barker . after his arraignment in november , purvis told reporters he had moved to another town to complete high school . e-mail to a friend .
525	editor 's note : in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . cnn 's senior vatican analyst john l. allen jr. is following the pope during his u.s. trip . pope benedict xvi asked pilgrims in st. peter 's square on sunday to pray for the success of his u.s. trip . new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the official motto of pope benedict xvi 's april 15-20 visit to the united states , the first of his papacy , is `` christ our hope . '' based on the frequency with which papal spokespersons have struck a different note , however , its unofficial motto might well be , `` this is not a political event . '' here 's a typical example from early april : `` the pope is not coming to get mixed up in the local political process , '' said italian archbishop pietro sambi , the pope 's ambassador to america , in an interview with the national catholic reporter . `` his presence is about something more universal and , at the same time , more personal . '' fear that benedict 's visit might be read through the lens of party politics reflects a key fact of electoral life in america : the `` catholic vote '' matters . to take the most obvious example , if a few heavily catholic counties in ohio had gone the other way in 2004 , pundits would today be handicapping the re-election of president john kerry . america 's almost 70 million catholics , representing a quarter of the country 's population , are diverse and divided . they do n't all agree with official church positions , and although catholics were once reliable democrats , today they 're not clearly aligned with either party . that 's a key reason why states with large catholic populations , such as ohio , pennsylvania , wisconsin and florida , are considered crucial battlegrounds . already in the 2008 race , catholics have made themselves felt . on the democratic side , they 're the biggest single reason sen. hillary clinton is still afloat . so far , the more catholic a state , the better clinton has done . with her back to the wall not long ago in ohio and texas , clinton decisively outpolled sen. barack obama among catholic democrats . in ohio , clinton won the catholic vote by a margin of 63 percent to 36 , while in texas it was 62 percent to 38 . clinton is now hoping that catholics will come through for her again in pennsylvania 's april 22 primary . the state 's 3.87 million catholics represent more than 30 percent of the population , and clinton is clinging to a lead despite pennsylvania sen. robert casey 's endorsement of obama . casey is a hero to pro-life catholic democrats , and his backing is apparently helping obama narrow the gap . clinton does better than obama among latinos , who are disproportionately catholic . she 's also winning catholic `` reagan democrats , '' meaning socially conservative blue-collar voters . obama 's recent gaffe , telling a crowd in san francisco , california , that small-town americans were `` clinging to guns or religion '' out of economic frustration , may help cement that advantage . once the democrats settle on a candidate , the catholic vote seems wide open in november . sen. john mccain , the presumptive republican nominee , appeals to many catholics because he 's pro-life and has a moderate stance on immigration . yet his willingness to remain in iraq for `` 100 years '' is at odds with the church 's opposition to the war . either clinton or obama could make a strong appeal to catholics on peace-and-justice issues , yet both are out of sync with catholic teaching on issues such as abortion , stem-cell research and gay rights . both sides are expected to court catholics aggressively . the mccain campaign recently formed a `` national catholics for mccain committee '' led by former kansas sen. sam brownback and former oklahoma gov. frank keating , along with a `` who 's who '' of prominent catholic conservatives . obama has his own `` national catholic advisory council , '' led by casey and former indiana rep. tim roemer , both pro-life democrats . clinton likewise has top-drawer catholic advisers . pope benedict 's trip is unlikely to offer a decisive boost to either side . he 'll probably strike pro-life notes that republicans can exploit , but he 'll also likely accent peace , concern for the poor and the environment , issues that generally skew to the democrats . watch as cnn 's rosemary church speaks with vatican analyst john allen about the pope 's visit '' any political fallout may thus depend on what happens to the pope 's message once it 's swept up into the sausage grinder of american spin . benedict xvi usually speaks not in sound bites but in carefully crafted paragraphs , which sometimes leaves the door ajar for competing explanations of what he really means . one can expect a `` war for the microphone '' among republican and democratic operatives , each looking to exploit pieces of the pope 's message . in a tight race , movement of even a few percentage points among catholics could be decisive . one sign the democrats understand what 's at stake is that house speaker nancy pelosi has arranged an april 16 conference call with reporters to comment on benedict 's trip -- in effect , not wanting president bush , and by extension the republicans , to claim a monopoly on the pope . all this makes the political implications of the pope 's presence difficult to anticipate . the best advice boils down to that classic broadcast cliché : `` stay tuned !

526	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- an elementary school at the center of a civil rights battle , a hospital ravaged by hurricane katrina and a hangar that once housed u.s. navy dirigibles are on this year 's national trust for historic preservation 's endangered list . sumner was the centerpiece of the landmark 1954 supreme court case brown v. board of education . the 11 sites represent the country 's architectural , cultural and natural heritage , and `` reflect extraordinary periods of american history , '' national trust director richard moe said . the sites were chosen from about 70 nominees by the member-supported nonprofit group . founded in 1949 , it aims to protect significant buildings and locales , now protected under the 1966 historic preservation act . of the roughly 200 places listed by the organization in the past 20 years , the national trust says only six have been lost . moe said the list is designed to raise awareness . `` the 11 represent the different kinds of historic places in different parts of the country . it 's a representative list , '' said moe , who leads the organization of nearly 300,000 members . endangerment does n't necessarily mean the building is in the potential path of a bulldozer , according to moe . lack of funding can be just as serious , as the case of the california state parks demonstrates . the sites are listed in alphabetical order : . boyd theater , philadelphia , pennsylvania the art deco movie palace known as the sameric was closed in 2002 and is for sale . a local group , friends of the boyd , is trying to save the 1928 theater , the last of its kind in philadelphia . only a few elaborate theaters from that era have survived , and the boyd was the only one built in the downtown area . moe said a `` sympathetic developer '' could restore the theater . california 's park system the largest state park system in the united states suffers from chronic underfunding , including $ 1.2 billion worth of deferred maintenance , the national trust said . the problem is worsening because of california 's budget crisis . gov. arnold schwarzenegger submitted a budget proposal this year that would have closed 48 parks , but the national trust said the revised budget restored $ 11.8 million of the $ 13.3 million in cuts he requested . current funds cover only 40 percent of maintenance and operations , which means irreplaceable historic and cultural resources remain endangered , the national trust said . the system includes 278 parks , 1.5 million acres and 295 miles of ocean front . many parks house historic buildings such as the 1820s-era franciscan la purisima mission complex near lompoc . charity hospital and adjacent neighborhood , new orleans , louisiana charity hospital , once the main trauma center for southeastern louisiana , was closed after hurricane katrina swamped new orleans in 2005 . the building was declared unsalvageable , according to donald r. smithburg , chief executive of louisiana state university health care services division , which operates university hospitals . there are plans to demolish nearly 200 homes in the mid-city neighborhood to accommodate construction of two new hospitals . alternate locations for the new hospitals are available , and charity hospital could be rehabilitated , according to the national trust . great falls portage , great falls , montana this national historic landmark is one of the best-preserved landscapes along the lewis and clark trail , but a massive coal-fired power plant is planned in the area . `` development abutting the great falls portage , an undeveloped rural area under panoramic blue montana skies , will irreparably harm the cultural and visual landscape , '' the national trust said . hangar one , moffett field , santa clara county , california the hangar was built in 1932 to house u.s. navy dirigibles . it is a cavernous , 200-foot-tall , dome-shaped structure sitting on more than 8 acres . a 2003 inspection revealed carcinogenic pcbs leaking from the hangar 's metallic exterior , the national trust said . pcbs were widely used in electrical transformers . the navy transferred hangar one to nasa in 1992 . although the navy remains responsible for environmental remediation , it is not required to preserve the building . lower east side , new york the lower east side in southeast manhattan was home for immigrants and the working class in the 19th and early 20th centuries , but it is becoming gentrified . development threatens historic churches , theaters , schools and tenements , `` a unique architectural type which , by the sheer numbers who lived in such a building , had an impact on more americans than any other form of urban housing , '' the national trust said . michigan avenue streetwall , chicago , illinois this 12-block stretch of historic buildings along michigan avenue between 11th and randolph streets dates back to the early 1880s . the streetwall is a collection of notable buildings by architects including adler & sullivan , louis sullivan , d. h. burnham and holabird & roche , the national trust said . although the stretch was designated a chicago landmark in 2002 , the national trust says its historic character is threatened by the inappropriate addition of large-scale towers that retain only small portions of the original buildings or their facades . peace bridge neighborhood , buffalo , new york the bridge and neighborhood , which has homes and buildings dating to the 1850s , includes two parks on the national register of historic places that are part of frederick law olmsted 's park system . the public bridge authority proposes to expand the bridge and build a 45-acre plaza that would destroy more than 100 homes and businesses , many of which are eligible for inclusion on the national register , the national trust said . according to the organization , the pba has refused to `` properly consider '' other sites . the statler hilton hotel , dallas , texas when the statler hilton opened in downtown dallas in 1956 , it was considered the most modern hotel in the country . today , the vacant building sits on a desirable parcel of real estate . the statler hilton faces pressure from encroaching development that may lead to demolition . the national trust says a sympathetic developer is needed to restore and reopen the hotel . sumner elementary school , topeka , kansas sumner was the centerpiece of the landmark 1954 supreme court case brown v. board of education . the court 's decision that `` separate educational facilities are inherently unequal '' helped launch the civil rights movement by declaring school segregation unconstitutional . vizcaya and the bonnet house , florida the development of out-of-scale buildings and corresponding zoning changes will ruin the vistas surrounding vizcaya museum and gardens in miami and the bonnet house museum and gardens in fort lauderdale , the national trust said . such development could set a precedent for high-rise structures , it added .

528	lagos , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a group of nigerian rebels who wrote a letter to u.s. president george w. bush , stating that they attacked two oil pipelines monday , have asked for former president jimmy carter and actor george clooney to help solve issues in the oil-rich niger-delta . military policemen patrol the creeks of the omadino community in warri south district of the niger delta . in a letter written by a group called movement for the emancipation of the niger delta , or mend , the group said they attacked two pipelines they believed are owned by chevron corp. and shell oil . a spokesman for royal dutch shell said its pipeline was damaged last week . the attack will temporarily cut shipments by 169,000 barrels a day as workers try to repair the damage , the spokesman said . the pipeline is owned jointly by shell and nigerian , french and italian oil companies , the spokesman said . chevron spokesman kurt glaubitz told cnn that `` no chevron pipelines have been vandalized in nigeria . '' there was no immediate comment from the nigerian government . in the letter the group called themselves `` commandos '' and stated that their aim was `` the crippling of the nigerian oil export industry . '' watch how nigeria attacks help hike gas prices '' `` today 's attack was prompted by the continuous injustice in the niger delta region of nigeria where the root issues have not been addressed by the illegal and insincere government , '' the letter stated . the letter stated that two other letters had been sent to bush and also actor george clooney , and the group also asked for president jimmy carter to help . clooney is one of the united nations ' messengers of peace , and has campaigned for an end to the long-standing conflict in darfur , as well as further humanitarian relief efforts in the region . carter is currently in the middle east , where he has met with the exiled militant hamas leader khalid meshaal , on what he calls a `` study mission '' to support peace , democracy , and human rights in the region . `` mend is prepared for talks and will prefer ex president jimmy carter to mediate . mr. carter is not in denial as the rest of you who brand freedom fighters as terrorists , '' the letter stated . `` the ripple effect of this attack will touch your economy and people one way or the other and hope we now have your attention . '' the organization also said they attack was in response to one of the arrest of one of their members , henry okah , who was arrested last year and according to local reports , is charged with treason . since late 2005 , mend militants have carried out numerous attacks on nigeria 's oil sector and abducted dozens of foreign workers , releasing nearly all of them unharmed . in the past the organization has said it had ratcheted up its attacks to redress what it says is the unequal distribution of the nation 's oil wealth . e-mail to a friend .

530	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- striking hollywood writers will be back at their keyboards wednesday after voting overwhelmingly to end a 100-day walkout that essentially shut down the entertainment industry . writers guild of america member steven binder shows his approval as he votes tuesday in beverly hills , california . more than 92 percent of the writers guild of america members who cast ballots tuesday in los angeles and new york voted to end their work stoppage over residuals for writing in the digital age , including new media and the internet . the new deal is for three years . `` the strike is over . our membership has voted , and writers can go back to work , '' said patric verrone , president of the wga 's west chapter . michael winship , president of wga 's east guild , said , `` the success of this strike is a significant achievement not only for ourselves but the entire creative community , now and in the future . '' wga members walked off the job november 5 after talks broke down over how writers are paid for the use of their material on the internet and dvds , among other issues . `` it is not all that we hoped for , and it is not all we deserve , '' verrone said when a tentative deal was announced saturday . but he added , `` this is the best deal this guild has bargained for in 30 years . '' leslie moonves , chief executive officer of cbs corp. , told the associated press , `` at the end of the day , everybody won . `` it was a fair deal and one that the companies can live with , and it recognizes the large contribution that writers have made to the industry . '' the alliance of motion picture and television producers , which represents production companies and media conglomerates , has had no comment on the agreement . the vote meant that the academy awards ceremony on february 24 will be the usual scripted gala , the ap reported . `` i am ecstatic that the 80th academy awards presentation can now proceed full steam ahead , '' without `` hesitation or discomfort '' for the nominees , sid ganis , president of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , which stages the oscars , told the ap . as long as the strike continued , the traditional oscars spectacular was in doubt since many hollywood stars would not cross wga picket lines . it 's unclear how soon new episodes of scripted programs will start appearing , because production wo n't begin until scripts are completed , the ap reported . it will take at least four weeks for producers to get the first post-strike episodes of comedies back on the air ; dramas will take six to eight weeks , the ap said . verrone said the wga achieved two of three goals through negotiations with the studios . watch verrone explain what he thinks the strike accomplished '' the first goal relates to writers ' `` jurisdiction '' in new media , verrone said , meaning that any content written by guild members specifically for new media , such as the internet or cell phones , will be covered by their contract . the second goal relates to reuse of content in new media , verrone said . the agreement bases payment for reuses on a distributor 's gross formula for residuals , `` so that when they get paid , we get paid , '' he said . it is the `` first time in our history that a new delivery system pays on a residual formula superior to the prior existing system , '' verrone said . the third goal , which verrone said the guild did not achieve , was to shore up writers ' shares of the revenue from animation and reality television . `` giving up animation and reality was a heartbreaking thing for me personally , '' he said . `` but it was more important that we make a deal that benefited the membership , the town as a whole , that got people back to work and that solved the biggest problems in new media .

531	-lrb- aol autos -rrb- -- some drivers would say that the united states is a crazy quilt of speed limits , with an emphasis on the `` crazy . '' a sign indicating the highest speed limit in the country stands by interstate 10 outside of the west texas town of el paso . since 1995 , states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits , leading to long debates on safety standards . to some folks , the speed limits are just insane -- either too low or too high , depending on their views about what makes driving safe . advocates of low speed limits wo n't find much to like about texas . true to its frontier roots , it stands out as the land of the fast getaway . the top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph , but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour , the highest speed limit on the country , on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner . this includes parts of interstate 10 between kerrville and el paso and of i-20 between monahans and the i-10 interchange . the speed limit for rural roads in montana is 75 mph . as a result , it takes just three hours to travel the 228 miles from billings to butte at the posted speed . but that 's much slower than a montana driver could have made the trip in early 1999 . at that time there was a six-month speeders ' honeymoon when the state had almost no control over rural speeds , partly as a result of an unfavorable court ruling . st. thomas in the u.s. virgin islands is at or near the other end of the spectrum . in the u.s. territory the speed limit is 20 mph in the city and 30 out in the country . when it comes to accident rates , though , you would be far better off on a montana interstate than competing with the island 's frenetic drivers on the way to paradise point . nationwide , maximum speeds range from 60 miles per hour in hawaii to 75 in most of the west . meanwhile , much of the eastern midwest and the northeast has opted for maximum speeds of 65 mph , although michigan and indiana chose the 70 mph standard more common to the south and the great plains states . so if you are cruising west along i-90 out of ohio , you can enjoy the increase in speed across 150 miles of indiana before illinois ' lower speed limit -- or its state police -- reins you in . as you continue west , interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in iowa , and then you can maintain a steady 75 from nebraska through to the california line , where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again . should you choose to detour into oregon , you 're back down to 65 . from a highway safety standpoint , the patchwork of speed limits at least seems to make sense . speeds are slower in more populous eastern states and faster in the wide-open west , although the insurance institute for highway safety argues that some of the new , higher speed limits out west and elsewhere are costing lives . it estimates that deaths on interstates and freeways have increased 15 percent due to the higher speed limits . but some researchers are skeptical about the link between accidents and high speeds on rural highways , if not on city streets and rural two-lanes . they point to the lower fatality rates on european highways , even though the speeds are generally higher . the maximum legal speed is roughly 80 mph in poland , austria , france and a few other countries . there is no speed limit on much of germany 's autobahn , although some sections are restricted to about 80 mph or less . ironically , the new regime of u.s. speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous . political scientist robert yowell , a professor at northeast lakeview college in texas , examined what happened after states began setting higher rural speed limits in 1995 . with the federal 65 mph limit gone , it was possible to compare the accident rates before and after the new limits went into effect . the results were clear : `` by and large , across the 50 states , there was no discernible effect from the higher limits , '' yowell said . `` two or three states actually had a decrease in fatalities . '' once speed limits are raised on interstates , drivers are more likely to get off the more dangerous two lanes and use the faster routes , yowell said . furthermore , the motorists traveling the fastest on the higher-speed interstates tend to be good at that kind of driving . the less competent drivers at high speeds tend to drive more slowly . while yowell admits most states are well-intentioned , he 's `` not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety , '' he said . `` they are a function of revenue generation as well . there have been cases of judges saying communities have to raise their speed limits because they were obviously being used to raise revenues and that 's not a proper use of the law . '' in part , yowell looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits . `` it may be that certain states have a different approach to questions involving personal liberty versus collective safety , '' he said . his research does n't surprise jim baxter , president of the waunakee , wisconsin-based national motorists association . his organization had lobbied heavily for an end to the federal limits . baxter 's rule of thumb for computing the right speed limit is the traffic engineering standard known as the 85th percentile speed . that 's the speed that 85 percent of motorists drive at or below . but it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set . with the speed limit set at that level , traffic tends to move smoothly , reducing the risk of accidents , baxter said . if you put the limit below that speed , some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers , creating the most dangerous conditions of all . baxter argues that most drivers naturally tend to drive at speeds that suit the road conditions and their driving skills . st. thomas is a case in point , albeit an extreme one . with its congestion and rugged terrain , the island is bereft of performance cars ; many of the vehicles are older pickups , aging japanese compacts and suvs . the treacherous conditions restrict speeds far more effectively than any local law . as joe aubain , executive director of the st. thomas-st . john chamber of commerce , puts it , `` even if you wanted to go a whole lot faster , you could n't , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .

'' in his statement , westin said , `` he was one of those very rare reporters who knew his beat better than anyone , and had developed more sources than anyone , and yet , kept his objectivity . '' after working as a reporter for u.s. news & world report , mcwethy joined abc news in 1979 , going on to cover conflicts in bosnia , kosovo and liberia , according to the abc news web site . mcwethy was the network 's primary reporter assigned to secretaries of state james baker , george shultz , warren christopher and lawrence eagleburger , abc said , and he had traveled to more than 50 countries . mcwethy was honored with at least five national emmys during his time at abc and also received an alfred i. dupont-columbia award and an overseas press club award , according to abc news ' web site . `` for three years i watched one of the finest news reporters do what so many in television still can not do to this day : be a reporter first , foremost and always , '' starr said . colleagues said he 'll be missed . `` everyone that knew jack is trading stories today , '' plante said . `` there is nothing but a sense of unambiguous loss on the part of all of his friends , colleagues , competitors and even the uniformed military officers that he covered as a reporter .

'' the reporter cited the fact that obama once failed to put his hand over his heart while singing the national anthem . obama replied that his choice not to put his hand on his heart is a behavior that `` would disqualify about three-quarters of the people who have ever gone to a football game or baseball game . '' the reporter also noted that the illinois senator does not wear an american flag lapel pin , has met with former members of the radical anti-vietnam war group , weather underground , and his wife was quoted recently as saying she never felt really proud of the united states until recently . asked how he would fight the image of being unpatriotic , obama said , `` there 's always some nonsense going on in general elections . right ? if it was n't this , it would be something else . if you recall , first it was my name . right ? that was a problem . and then there was the muslim e-mail thing and that has n't worked out so well , and now it 's the patriotism thing . `` the way i will respond to it is with the truth : that i owe everything i am to this country , '' he said . the first-term senator from illinois has been the subject of various debunked rumors since launching his presidential campaign -- allegations that he is a muslim , that he took his oath of office on a copy of the quran and that he attended a radical islamic school while living in indonesia as a boy . `` you will recall that the reason i came to national attention was a speech in which i spoke of my love of this country , '' said obama . he and his wife , michelle , had already explained her comments . `` she simply misspoke , '' he said . `` what she was referring to was -lsb- that -rsb- this was the first time she has been proud of politics in america . watch what michelle obama said '' `` that 's true of a lot of people who have been cynical and disenchanted . and she 's spoken about how she has been cynical about american politics for a very long time , but she 's proud of how people are participating and getting involved in ways that they have n't in a very long time . '' about not wearing an american flag lapel pin , obama said republicans have no lock on patriotism . `` a party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed , or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning , or are not fulfilling the veterans ' benefits that these troops need when they come home , or are undermining our constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary ? `` that is a debate i am very happy to have . we 'll see what the american people think is the true definition of patriotism . '' obama did not respond to the question about the weather underground , a group whose members bombed the u.s. capitol and the pentagon during the 1970s . last week , the new york sun reported that as an illinois state senator in 2001 , obama accepted a $ 200 contribution from william ayers , a founder of the group who was not convicted for the bombings and now works as a professor at the university of illinois at chicago . but the paper said that , in a statement , a spokesman for the obama campaign , william burton , said , `` sen. obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the weathermen group , as he does all acts of violence ... but he was an 8-year-old child when ayers and the weathermen were active , and any attempt to connect obama with events of almost 40 years ago is ridiculous .

537	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- record oil prices , the sub-prime mortgage mess and slumping stock markets are hardly music to the ears of investors . in tough economic times like these , investors seek out safe , stable investments such as guaranteed government bonds or cds . yet a growing number are being wooed by the sweet sounds , and profits , of something new -- investment funds specializing in high-end musical instruments . the stradivarius violin -- only about 700 are believed to exist -- is the premier investment instrument . talented musicians want them , but ca n't afford them -- one fetched $ 3.5 million at auction . enter nigel brown , winner of the queen 's award for enterprise and chairman of the nw brown group , a financial services company . he brings musician and investor together . `` what happens is , a musician comes along to see me , having fallen in love with an instrument , '' brown says . `` then , what i do is to pull a syndicate of people together to buy this instrument so that the musician can then have the use of it ... '' down the road , the musician can buy the instrument from the investors . they split the profits if its value appreciates . that 's how violinist matthew trusler got his $ 2 million stradivarius . brown loved trusler 's playing and funded the instrument himself . `` they are just the most fantastic violins that were ever made , '' trusler says , clutching his . `` this one was made in 1711 ... and it 's been around for 300 years and it 's a really wonderful violin . '' not everyone is convinced a stradivarius is such a great deal -- particularly modern instrument makers . `` i think if you can get hold of one of the very best strads , not just any strad ... i think they probably give you , as a player , something special , '' says violin-maker andreas hudelmayer . `` but if you ca n't have one of the very few best , you are just as well off with a new instrument . '' his reasoning ? the cost of insuring a stradivarius for just a couple of years would pay for a new , top-quality violin , hudelmayer says . even so , the reality is that old violins are attracting those looking for alternative investments . a new hedge fund called the fine violins fund is dedicated to top-range instruments . the latest studies show exclusive violins are earning a steady 3.5 percent a year since 1850 . that beats u.s. treasury bonds over the same timeframe , with their 2.19 percent average yield . of course , you have to be in the investment game for the long haul . `` they 've proved to be fantastic investments , '' says simon morris , director of beare 's -- a broker and appraiser of high-end violins , violas and cellos . `` for many of the musicians that bought say in the 1960s , they 've been the best pension plan they could 've had . `` like anything , you have to purchase well and sell well . you ca n't just go and buy any old thing . '' but for these investors , the financial return is only part of the investment . `` the fact they make a financial gain is of course gratifying at the end of the day , but it is mostly the support of the musician , '' says brown . `` they like being able to go along to a concert and hear their instrument performed by their artist .

'' the single-sex service , which started in january , is available on four major lines in the city , and it 's expected to expand to another 15 . other plans include replacing male drivers with women . one woman described the service as `` excellent , '' saying it 's `` more comfortable too because it does n't make as many stops . '' another passenger said she feels more comfortable and safer . last year , the government received seven complaints of sexual abuse aboard the city 's buses , which provide 200 million rides each year , officials said . authorities said that a single complaint is enough to justify taking such measures . juan flores , who has driven buses in mexico city for 15 years and now steers one for women only , said he even notices a difference . `` i feel more tranquil , i work more peacefully and the interior of the bus is cleaner , '' he said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mario gonzalez contributed to this report .

544	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- every day , five u.s. soldiers try to kill themselves . before the iraq war began , that figure was less than one suicide attempt a day . a u.s. soldier patrols the streets of baghdad in january . the dramatic increase is revealed in new u.s. army figures , which show 2,100 soldiers tried to commit suicide in 2007 . `` suicide attempts are rising and have risen over the last five years , '' said col. elspeth cameron-ritchie , an army psychiatrist . concern over the rate of suicide attempts prompted sen. jim webb , d-virginia , to introduce legislation thursday to improve the military 's suicide-prevention programs . `` our troops and their families are under unprecedented levels of stress due to the pace and frequency of more than five years of deployments , '' webb said in a written statement . watch cnn senior pentagon correspondent jamie mcintyre on the reasons for the increase in suicides '' sen. patty murray , d-washington , took to the senate floor thursday , urging more help for military members , especially for those returning from war . `` our brave service members who face deployment after deployment without the rest , recovery and treatment they need are at the breaking point , '' murray said . she said congress has given `` hundreds of millions of dollars '' to the military to improve its ability to provide mental health treatment , but said it will take more than money to resolve the problem . `` it takes leadership and it takes a change in the culture of war , '' she said . she said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help . `` many soldiers need a real person to talk to , '' she said . `` and they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists . '' according to army statistics , the incidence of u.s. army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the iraq war . last year 's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002 , the year before the war in iraq began , according to the army . the figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in march , army officials said . the army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides . suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths , compared with 87 in 2005 . cameron-ritchie , the army psychiatrist , said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships , but they are also related to problems with work , finances and the law . `` the really tough area here is stigma . we know that soldiers do n't want to go seek care . they 're tough , they 're strong , they do n't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider , '' cameron-ritchie said . multiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships , thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts , she said . traditionally , the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age - and gender-matched civilians . but in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006 , she said . that 's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000 , she said . the `` typical '' soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act , according to the army . post-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts , cameron-ritchie said , because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse . `` the real central issue is relationships . relationships , relationships , relationships , '' said u.s. army chaplain lt. col. ran dolinger . `` people look at ptsd , they look at length of deployments ... but it 's that broken relationship that really makes the difference . '' to reduce suicides , the army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been in iraq for long periods and teaching them to notice signs that can lead to suicide . that training came too late for army specialist tim bowman . the 23-year-old killed himself in 2005 after returning from iraq . `` as my family was preparing for a 2005 thanksgiving meal , our son timothy was lying on the floor , slowly bleeding to death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound , '' said his father , mike bowman , in testimony to a house veterans ' affairs committee hearing in december . `` his war was now over .

551	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- serie a champions inter milan have confirmed the dismissal of coach roberto mancini , opening the way for former chelsea manager jose mourinho to replace him . mancini guided inter milan to the italian league title for three successive seasons . ironically , the 43-year-old mancini , who guided inter to three successive italian league titles , is now the favorite to take mourinho 's former job at stamford bridge . inter -- who won the first of their three titles in 2006 because those above them were demoted or deducted points over the matchfixing scandal -- released a statement about the sacking . `` inter milan have informed roberto mancini that he has been relieved of his role as coach , especially because of his comments that he was not going to stay after the end of the season following the champions league tie against liverpool on march 11 , '' read their statement . mancini , however , rescinded those comments the following day declaring that he had made them in the heat of the moment following inter 's elimination from the competition , losing 3-0 on aggregate . inter 's reasons for sacking mancini appear less credible after club president massimo moratti announced that the coach had changed his mind about leaving at the end of the season . `` i 've had a talk with mancini , who confirmed to me that he wanted to stay at inter next year to see out his contract . he wants to win the champions league for us next season , '' moratti said on march 12 . `` mancini 's words surprised me , i did n't expect it and even less so i believe the people close to him . '' mourinho , nicknamed ` the special one ' for guiding porto to the champions league in 2004 and then chelsea to two premier league titles , would not come cheap , but the exit of mancini has cost inter dear too as his contract , which runs till 2012 , will leave him 24 million euros richer as compensation . however , mancini was unable to make inter into viable champions league contenders despite the three serie a titles . mancini is the ninth coaching casualty under moratti , following ottavio bianchi , roy hodgson , luigi simoni , mircea lucescu , marcello lippi , marco tardelli , hector cuper and alberto zaccheroni .

553	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. hillary clinton on thursday sharpened her attacks on democratic rival sen. barack obama as she faces what even her supporters admit are must-win situations in texas and ohio in the weeks ahead . at a campaign stop at a general motors corp. plant in youngstown , ohio , the senator from new york accused obama of caving in to special interests . `` my opponent says that he 'll take on the special interests , '' she said . `` well , he told people he stood up to the nuclear industry and passed a bill against them . but he actually let the nuclear industry water down his bill -- the bill never actually passed . '' clinton was referring to a 2006 bill that obama drafted after an illinois nuclear power plant was found to have released radiation into surrounding groundwater . obama 's original bill would have required power plants to notify the public and government officials when any radiation was released , but subsequent versions had less stringent reporting requirements , the new york times reported . the bill was never voted on by the full senate . clinton also accused obama of supporting `` billions of dollars of breaks for the oil industry '' by voting for an energy bill she opposed and said he did not support the workers of a maytag corp. plant that closed in his home state of illinois . watch clinton attack obama '' reacting to clinton 's charges , obama spokesman bill burton said his candidate `` does n't need any lectures on special interests from the candidate who 's taken more money from washington lobbyists than any republican running for president . '' `` sen. clinton may have said that attacks and distortions are the ` fun ' and ` exciting ' part of the campaign , but they 're exactly what everyone else in america is tired of , '' burton said . in recent days , clinton has challenged obama 's ability to deliver on his rhetoric . `` there 's a big difference between us -- speeches versus solutions , talk versus action , '' she said . `` speeches do n't put food on the table . speeches do n't fill up your tank or fill your prescription or do anything about that stack of bills that keeps you up at night . '' her remarks in ohio echo statements she made a day earlier in mcallen , texas , when she said , `` i am in the solutions business . my opponent is in the promises business . '' clinton was set later thursday to hold events in dayton and columbus , ohio . obama was to be in his hometown of chicago , illinois , and had no public events scheduled . cnn contributor and clinton supporter james carville said the senator must do well in the march 4 ohio and texas primaries if she is to stop obama 's momentum . carville said he thought clinton could still win the nomination . `` you know , this thing is close . not all the democrats have been heard from . ... if anybody can do this , i think she can , '' said carville , a major force behind president clinton 's successful 1992 campaign . clinton 's aggressive stance may be in reaction to obama 's momentum after he won eight contests in a row -- including victories by wide margins in tuesday 's primaries in maryland , virginia and the district of columbia . watch how the so-called potomac primaries put obama on a roll '' in those contests , obama also outpolled clinton among demographic groups she had carried earlier -- women , lower-income voters and latinos . clinton is banking on those groups to carry her to victory in texas and ohio . the wins in the potomac primaries gave obama a lead over clinton in the delegate count for the first time -- 1,253 to 1,211 , according to cnn calculations . `` in my neighborhood , you know , you had to win games if you wanted to brag , '' said jamal simmons , a democratic strategist and obama supporter . `` and i think right now , barack obama is ahead in delegates . he 's ahead in states . he 's ahead in the popular vote . he 's winning . `` sen. clinton has got to win some of these contests , you know , to get to the finals . '' neither clinton nor obama is likely to pick up the 2,025 delegates needed to win the nomination outright before the primary season ends in june , mainly because democrats divvy up each state 's delegates in proportion to the candidates ' share of the popular vote . watch an outlook of the democratic race '' the democratic nomination likely will be decided by the roughly 800 superdelegates , which include party officers , elected officials and activists . obama 's camp argues the superdelegates should support the candidate with the most popular support , as indicated by a majority of pledged delegates going into the convention . clinton 's campaign , on the other hand , says the superdelegates should support the candidate they think will be the best nominee in the general election as well as the best president . watch how the campaigns are fighting for superdelegates '' moveon.org , an influential liberal activist group , on thursday said it would launch a petition drive calling on the superdelegates not to go against the popular vote . `` the worst thing for the party and democracy is if all these new voters feel like the nomination was brokered in a backroom somewhere . the superdelegates have got to let the voters decide , '' moveon.org executive director eli pariser said in a statement . moveon.org has endorsed obama . in a possible indication that clinton is going to fight for every delegate , her camp on thursday announced that daughter chelsea clinton would be dispatched to hawaii to campaign before the state 's primary tuesday . watch how each campaign is fighting for delegates '' however , chelsea clinton may face an uphill battle there since hawaii is obama 's native state . bill clinton on thursday was scheduled to campaign in wisconsin , which also holds its primary tuesday . recent polls in that state have shown a tight race between the two democrats . a strategic vision survey conducted february 8 through sunday finds obama ahead of clinton 45 percent to 41 percent , a lead outside the poll 's margin of error of 3 percentage points . carville said clinton could recover from a loss in wisconsin . `` it certainly would be preferable for her to win wisconsin , but i do n't put it in the same category as i would put texas and ohio on march 4 , '' he said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's peter hamby and chris welch contributed to this report .

'' msnbc correspondent david shuster said this month about her reputed calls to superdelegates . clinton communications director howard wolfson excoriated shuster and called his remarks `` beneath contempt '' and disgusting . the senator from new york even sent a damning letter to nbc and demanded `` appropriate action . '' `` i am a mom first and a candidate second , and i found the remark incredibly offensive , '' she said . -lrb- shuster was suspended indefinitely for the remark , made february 7 when he was a guest host for tucker carlson . msnbc said thursday that the suspension will end february 22 . -rrb- . even a fourth-grader apparently ca n't get through to the press-shy chelsea clinton . scholastic news `` kid reporter '' sydney rieckhoff was in pursuit of a story as she questioned presidential candidates last month on the campaign trail in iowa , according to the associated press . approaching chelsea clinton , she reportedly asked , `` do you think your dad would be a good ` first man ' in the white house ? '' but clinton was n't talking . `` i 'm sorry , i do n't talk to the press and that applies to you , unfortunately . even though i think you 're cute , '' she said , according to the ap . during a campaign stop at the luckie food lounge in atlanta , georgia , in mid-january , one supporter asked clinton to reveal something that nobody else knew about her . she responded she would love to -- if all the cameras were n't around . clinton has proven to be an effective campaigner for her mother , according to a campaign source , saying there 's a strong correlation between her visits and improved performance . at this point , the campaign has become a fight for delegates , and even narrowing a loss has a big impact , a source said . this election cycle , clinton campaigned for her mother in california , the first state where the senator won the youth vote . a rural congressional district in nebraska where she campaigned reportedly outperformed others in the state . politicians protecting their children from the spotlight is hardly new . the bushes complained when daughters jenna and barbara became fodder for late-night comics and media outlets . vice president dick cheney also has been reticent when it comes to his daughter mary , who had a child with her lesbian partner . during a debate with cheney in 2004 , democratic vice presidential candidate john edwards broached the topic , saying , `` i think the vice president and his wife love their daughter . i think they love her very much . and you ca n't have anything but respect for the fact that they 're willing to talk about the fact that they have a gay daughter . '' cheney responded , `` let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter . i appreciate that very much . ... that 's it . '' but the vice president later slammed sen. john kerry for his remarks about mary cheney when asked about homosexuality during a debate with president bush . the vice president said kerry was `` out of line ; '' wife lynne cheney called him `` not a good man . '' these exchanges show that as chelsea clinton 's public persona rises , so too will questions about why she does n't make herself available to reporters . the clinton campaign said chelsea clinton is trying to reach as many people as possible and has `` appeared in dozens of venues in more than 20 states .

563	san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- on the question of whether recent immigrants assimilate as quickly as previous waves , many americans exhibit short fuses -- and even shorter memories . ruben navarrette jr. notes that immigrants have been criticized throughout history for not assimilating . they have convinced themselves that , instead of adapting to the customs of this country , new arrivals -- most of whom come from asia or latin america -- expect the rest of us to accommodate them . they go ballistic over little things -- mexican flags , taco trucks , libraries that offer bilingual story time , or having to `` press one for english . '' yet , even as they look down on new immigrants , many americans look back fondly upon their immigrant ancestors . legend has it that when grandpa arrived from ireland , germany , italy or poland , he jumped off the boat , immediately draped himself in the american flag , ripped out his native tongue , and abandoned his culture -- all while singing `` yankee doodle dandy . '' germans did not move to milwaukee and make beer and cheese . the irish did not settle in boston and join organizations like the hibernian society to preserve their heritage and culture . and even while americans complain about how the current crop of immigrants are n't like their predecessors , they miss the irony : at the time , there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors ; the germans were thought to not be like the english , the irish were n't like the germans , the italians were n't like the irish etc. . and the chinese were n't like anyone who had come before them , and so they were labeled `` unassimilable '' by the tom tancredos of that era . some things never change . when i was growing up in central california , which is home to a large population of immigrants from southeast asia , thousands would gather to celebrate hmong new year . the local newspaper would do a feature . and , in the days that followed , someone would write an angry letter to the editor complaining that these people were n't melting into the pot . yet , there is more melting going on than one might think , according to a new report from the manhattan institute . billed as the first annual index of immigrant assimilation , the study was written by duke university professor jacob vigdor . it measured three kinds of assimilation : economic -lrb- employment , education , homeownership , etc. -rrb- ; cultural -lrb- intermarriage , english proficiency , family size , etc. -rrb- ; and civic -lrb- citizenship , military service , political participation , etc. -rrb- . far from discovering that recent immigrants are ducking the assimilation process , the study found that `` immigrants of the past quarter-century have assimilated more rapidly than their counterparts of a century ago , even though they are more distinct from the native population upon arrival . '' of course , individual groups still fall behind in some categories . chinese and indian immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation . mexican immigrants have low levels of economic assimilation . and canadian and indian immigrants have low levels of civic assimilation , since few of them become citizens . but , overall , the news is good . after more than 200 years , america still does an excellent job of assimilating immigrants . even if a particular group tried to resist the process , they would n't stand a chance . assimilation happens , whether the immigrants are ready or not . those are the facts . of course , fear does n't listen to facts . that is something else that has n't changed . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .

567	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- ecological and conservation groups are praising a move by the environmental protection agency to impose new restrictions on rat poisons to help reduce the threat of accidental exposure to children and wildlife . the rules say only farmers , livestock owners and certified rodent control employees can buy rat poison in bulk . `` we are very happy that the epa has done all it can to get these products off of the consumer market , '' said michael fry , director of conservation advocacy for the american bird conservancy . `` by putting these restrictions in place , they are allowing a compromise to be made between themselves and organizations who have been working on this problem for a long time . '' the epa 's new measures , which were handed down thursday , require that rat poisons be kept in bait stations above ground and in containers that meet agency standards . loose bait , such as pellets , and the four most hazardous types of pesticides , known as `` second-generation anticoagulants , '' will no longer be sold for personal use . under the new restrictions , only farmers , livestock owners and certified rodent control employees will be allowed to purchase rat poison in bulk . bags larger than 8 pounds will no longer be sold at hardware and home-improvement stores . children who come into contact with highly toxic pellets can experience terrible symptoms from digesting them . they include internal bleeding , nosebleeds , hair loss and extensive bruising . between 2001 and 2003 , rat poison was responsible for nearly 60,000 poisonings , according to a study done by the american association of poison control centers . about 250 of these yearly exposures result in serious injuries or death . the epa said it believes the restrictions will not only keep the products out of children 's hands , but also reduce the ecological and wildlife risks associated with exposure to rat poison . bait blocks that are typically placed on the ground use fish and other flavors that attract endangered species , including mountain lions . `` in california , almost every animal tested by the national wildlife service had residues of rodenticides , '' said fry . `` the rat baits are also very lethal to scavengers , because the toxins remain in the rodent 's body long after they initially die . '' although the epa is receiving considerable praise for the initiative , this is n't the first time the agency has worked to combat the threat of rat poison . in 1998 , the epa established two standards for rat poison . the agency required manufacturers to include an ingredient that made the poison taste bitter and use an indicator dye that would make the ingestion of pesticides more recognizable . but regulations were revoked in 2001 after the agency came to a mutual agreement with manufacturers to rescind the requirements . `` we determined that the dye was n't effective in keeping children from being accidentally exposed and the bittering agent actually resulted in a loss of efficiency in controlling rodents , '' said steven bradbury , director of the agency 's division of special review and re-registration . `` in our decision thursday , we felt that we needed an approach that would stop children coming in contact with the pesticides in the first place . that ultimately led to the implementation of bait stations , '' bradbury said . the decision to revoke the requirements led the west harlem environmental action , inc. and the natural resource defense council to file a lawsuit three years later . both organizations saw the retraction as a way to make it easy for consumers to purchase unsafe rodenticides over the counter . according to the west harlem group , inner-city housing and park departments such as the new york city housing authority could continue laying rat baits in public areas that were easily accessible to children . `` studies show that the number of poisonings in minority children is much higher than others , '' said aaron colangelo , a staff attorney at the natural resource defense council . `` not only do we have an environmental health issue , but an environmental justice issue as well . '' new york state health department studies showed that 57 percent of children hospitalized for rat poisoning were black and 26 percent were latino . the epa said it is working to reduce those numbers in upcoming years with regulations like the ones it introduced this week . `` we were frustrated that the epa dragged their feet for three years before finally taking some productive steps , '' said colangelo . `` but , from our perspective , they are finally starting to do what needs to be done in order to protect children . '' after june 4 , rat poison manufacturers will have 90 days to comply with the epa 's guidelines . they will then have the opportunity to design new bait stations and formulas for their poisons . all new products should be registered and certified by june 2011 .
568	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- suspected islamic insurgents fired mortar rounds at a plane carrying somalia 's transitional president , but no one -- including abdullahi yusuf ahmed -- was harmed , a presidential spokesman said . somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed , pictured late last month during a visit to france . the attack happened while the plane was about to take off from mogadishu 's airport sunday around 11 a.m. local time , spokesman hussien mohammed huubsireb said . `` al-shaabab has actually tried to harm to president , but thank god nobody was hurt , '' huubsireb said . al-shaabab is an islamic militia that is trying to seize control of somalia . it is a splinter group of the islamic courts union , which ousted somalia 's transitional government in 2006 . the icu was deposed in december of that year following ethiopia 's military invasion . bloody battles between al-shaabab and the ethiopian-backed government forces in mogadishu have forced residents to flee the capital . more than 40,000 displaced civilians have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of mogadishu , described by the united nations as `` precarious conditions . '' sunday 's mortar attack is the second assassination attempt on ahmed . the president survived a car bombing in september 2006 outside somalia 's parliament in baidoa that killed at least eight others . somalia 's prime minister ali mohamed gedi has been more frequently targeted by the islamic insurgents seeking to destabilize the government . somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator mohamed siad barre and sparked brutal clan infighting . somalia 's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital , with the help of the better-equipped ethiopian forces . but the presence of the ethiopians has united various islamic militant groups in somalia , including al-shaabab , who are trying to oust the ethiopian forces and gain control of mogadishu . the united states classified al-shaabab as a terrorist organization in march , partly because of what washington says is the group 's close ties to osama bin laden 's al qaeda militant group .

'' despite the frosty reception , connecticut sen. chris dodd joined clinton in criticizing obama . he said obama 's stance could undermine pakistani president pervez musharraf , the country 's military ruler , who has been a u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda . `` while general musharraf is no thomas jefferson , he may be the only thing that stands between us and having an islamic fundamentalist state in that country , '' dodd said . `` so while i would like to see him change , the reality is , if we lose him , then what we face is an alternative that could be a lot worse for our country . '' obama jumped into the fray . `` i find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism , '' he said . `` if we have actionable intelligence on al qaeda operatives , including -lsb- osama -rsb- bin laden , and president musharraf can not act , then we should , '' obama said . `` that 's just common sense . '' he also said americans had the right to participate in the debate over such a key aspect of american foreign policy . but clinton countered by saying that while u.s. forces might have to pursue action inside pakistan `` on the basis of actionable intelligence , '' it was `` a very big mistake to telegraph that and to destabilize the musharraf regime , which is fighting for its life against the islamist extremists who are in bed with al qaeda and the taliban . '' `` remember , pakistan has nuclear weapons . the last thing we want is to have al qaeda-like followers in charge of pakistan and having access to nuclear weapons . '' sen. joe biden of delaware responded later in the debate , noting that the strategy obama outlined was already u.s. policy . `` everyone 's entitled to their own opinion , but not their own facts , '' biden said . `` it 's already the policy of the united states -- has been for four years -- that there 's actionable intelligence , we would go into pakistan .

572	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some 220 square miles of ice has collapsed in antarctica and an ice shelf about seven times the size of manhattan is `` hanging by a thread , '' the british antarctic survey said tuesday , blaming global warming . scientists say the size of the threatened shelf is about 5,282 square miles . `` we are in for a lot more events like this , '' said professor ted scambos , a glaciologist at the national snow and ice data center at the university of colorado at boulder . scambos alerted the british antarctic survey after he noticed part of the wilkins ice shelf disintegrating on february 28 , when he was looking at nasa satellite images . late february marks the end of summer at the south pole and is the time when such events are most likely , he said . watch aerial footage of the area '' `` the amazing thing was , we saw it within hours of it beginning , in between the morning and the afternoon pictures of that day , '' scambos said of the large chunk that broke away on february 28 . the wilkins ice shelf lost about 6 percent of its surface a decade ago , the british antarctic survey said in a statement on its web site . another 220 square miles -- including the chunk that scambos spotted -- had splintered from the ice shelf as of march 8 , the group said . `` as of mid-march , only a narrow strip of shelf ice was protecting several thousand kilometers of potential further breakup , '' the group said . scambos ' center put the size of the threatened shelf at about 5,282 square miles , comparable to the state of connecticut , or about half the area of scotland . see a map and photos as the collapse progressed '' once scambos called the british antarctic survey , the group sent an aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to examine the extent of the breakout . `` we flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage , '' said jim elliott , according to the group 's web site . `` big hefty chunks of ice , the size of small houses , look as though they 've been thrown around like rubble -- it 's like an explosion , '' he said . `` wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the antarctic peninsula yet to be threatened , '' david vaughan of the british antarctic survey said , according to the web site . `` i did n't expect to see things happen this quickly . the ice shelf is hanging by a thread -- we 'll know in the next few days or weeks what its fate will be . '' but with antarctica 's summer ending , scambos said the `` unusual show is over for this season . '' ice shelves are floating ice sheets attached to the coast . because they are already floating , their collapse does not have any effect on sea levels , according to the cambridge-based british antarctic survey . scambos said the ice shelf is not currently on the path of the increasingly popular tourist ships that travel from south america to antarctica . but some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse . `` wildlife will be impacted , but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy-turvy world , '' he said . `` the ecosystem is pretty resilient . '' several ice shelves -- prince gustav channel , larsen inlet , larsen a , larsen b , wordie , muller and jones -- have collapsed in the past three decades , the british antarctic survey said . larsen b , a 1,254-square-mile ice shelf , comparable in size to the u.s. state of rhode island , collapsed in 2002 , the group said . scientists say the western antarctic peninsula -- the piece of the continent that stretches toward south america -- has warmed more than any other place on earth over the past 50 years , rising by 0.9 degrees fahrenheit each decade . scambos said the poles will be the leading edge of what 's happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues . `` even though they seem far away , changes in the polar regions could have an impact on both hemispheres , with sea level rise and changes in climate patterns , '' he said . news of the wilkins ice shelf 's impending breakup came less than two weeks after the united nations environment program reported that the world 's glaciers are melting away and that they show `` record '' losses . `` data from close to 30 reference glaciers in nine mountain ranges indicate that between the years 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 the average rate of melting and thinning more than doubled , '' the unep said march 16 . the most severe glacial shrinking occurred in europe , with norway 's breidalblikkbrea glacier , unep said . that glacier thinned by about 10 feet in 2006 , compared with less than a foot the year before , it said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's marsha walton contributed to this report .

575	paris , france -- top-seeded maria sharapova was a shock casualty at the french open on monday when she crashed 6-7 7-6 6-2 against fellow russian dinara safina in paris . ecstasy : safina releases her emotions after her comeback win over maria sharapova in the french open last 16 . bidding for the only grand slam title she has yet to win , new world no. 1 sharapova twice blew big leads in the second set . sharapova 's customary screeches reached maximum volume as the match slipped away , and the noise seemed to annoy fans . they whistled and booed sharapova as she left court suzanne lenglen after the match , and she did n't acknowledge the crowd . `` i ca n't please everyone . it 's not in my job description , '' she said . `` i 'm an athlete , and i go out there and fight my heart out . they paid the ticket to watch me , so they must appreciate me on some level , right ? '' sharapova won five consecutive games in the second set to go ahead 5-2 , and held a match point serving in the next game . she also led 5-2 in the second tiebreaker before losing five consecutive points , then unraveled down the stretch , losing the final four games and 10 of the last 12 points . it was the latest setback for sharapova on clay , her least-favorite surface . `` on this stuff , things happen in a hurry , '' she said . `` it was all in her hands , '' safina said . `` then suddenly it changed . '' safina , the younger sister of two-time grand slam champion marat safin , duplicated her upset of sharapova in the fourth round at roland garros in 2006 . she received a congratulatory text from her brother and said she hopes to join him as the winner of a major title . `` a dream of all our family , '' she said . `` once we do this , we can put the racket on the wall and say we did everything we could . but to get to his level , i still have to work a little bit harder . '' the no. 13-seeded safina 's next opponent will be no. 7 elena dementieva , who won another all-russian matchup against no. 11 vera zvonareva , 6-4 1-6 6-2 . trailing sharapova 5-3 in the second set , safina saved match point with a backhand winner , then broke two points later when sharapova pushed a forehand wide . in the second tiebreaker , sharapova double-faulted for 5-4 and then hit three errant backhands . that evened the match , but the momentum favored safina . sharapova 's customary squeals during rallies became more intense during the sixth game of the final set , and she screamed at herself after points . `` just trying to pump myself up , '' she said . `` i was trying to get angry about something . i just started playing tentatively . '' she erased three break points before conceding the game with a forehand into the net . that gave safina a 4-2 lead , and she closed out the victory , falling to her knees with glee when sharapova socked a wild forehand on match point . it was latest in a series of memorable victories over the past month for safina . she was the last player to beat recently retired justine henin , a four-time french open champion . that upset came on clay in early may at berlin , where safina went on to win the biggest title of her career . `` she 's a really tough opponent on this surface , '' sharapova said . `` i came very close , but it did n't go my way for some reason . '' in other fourth round ties , russian fourth seed svetlana kuznetsova was leading belarussian 16th seed victoria azarenka 6-2 2-2 while petra kvitova of the czech republic and estonia 's kaia kanepi were 3-6 6-3 when play was halted .
576	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the nation 's largest publicly owned utility company may be vulnerable to cyber attacks , according to a new report . in 2007 president bush visited the browns ferry nuclear plant , operated by the tennessee valley authority . the tennessee valley authority , which supplies power to almost 9 million americans , `` has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures , '' leaving them `` vulnerable to disruption , '' the government accountability office found . simply put , that means a skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout . rep. james langevin , a rhode island democrat , fears the problem is much larger than just the tva . `` if they are not secure , i do n't have a great deal of confidence that the rest of our critical infrastructure on the electric grid is secure , '' he said . the tva operates 52 nuclear , hydroelectric and fossil-fuel facilities in the southeastern united states . among the government watchdog agency findings : . • the tva 's firewalls have been bypassed or are inadequately configured . • passwords are not effective . • servers and work stations lack key patches and effective virus protection . • intrusion-detection systems are not adequate . • some locations lack enough physical security around control systems . the gao recommends 73 steps to correct the problems in its report to congress . in september , cnn first aired dramatic footage of a government experiment demonstrating that a cyber attack could destroy electrical equipment . the experiment , dubbed `` aurora , '' caused a generator to fall apart and grind to a halt after a computer attack on its control system . the test was conducted by scientists at the idaho national laboratory . in october , the north american electric reliability corp. told congress that 75 percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the aurora vulnerability , but langevin said it now appears that congress was misled . a congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation 's claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to fix the problem . `` it appears that they just made those numbers up , '' langevin said . `` it is not acceptable . it is outrageous . '' he said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks . the electric reliability corporation -- a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers -- told cnn it regrets the confusion . experts told cnn that cooper industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the aurora vulnerability . the company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide . it has sold just over 100 , it told cnn . langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps , and he will press to give those powers to the federal energy regulatory commission . the congressman is chairing an emerging threats , cybersecurity , and science and technology subcommittee hearing wednesday afternoon . representatives of the tva , the gao , the federal commission and the electric reliability corporation are to appear before the subcommittee .

'' in the video , van der sloot says holloway and her friends begged him to go out with them the night of may 29 , 2005 . the dutch student said he and two friends -- brothers deepak and satish kalpoe -- met the women at a bar in oranjestad . when they arrived , he said , the women appeared to have been drinking heavily and some were using cocaine . holloway was in aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from mountain brook high school in suburban birmingham , alabama . after declining an invitation from holloway to dance on stage with her , he agreed to drink a shot of liquor from her navel as she lay on the bar , he said . about 1 a.m. may 30 , he said , she left the bar with him and the kalpoes , telling her friends she would meet them at their hotel before their planned return flight the next day to the united states , he said . the three men previously told authorities they then drove to the beach with holloway , leaving her there when she told them she wanted to stay . but van der sloot gave a different account in the hidden-camera footage . he said he wanted to have sex with holloway , but she told him she did not want to go to her hotel . instead , she said , she wanted to see sharks , he told the informant . the two brothers then used their car to drive van der sloot and holloway to the beach by the hotel and left them , van der sloot said . he and holloway then had sex , he said . but as they were caressing each other , she started shaking , then said nothing , he said . `` all of a sudden , what she did was like in a movie , '' he said . `` she was shaking , it was awful . ... i prodded her , there was nothing . '' he said he panicked and , when she did not appear to be alive , shook her but was unable to resuscitate her . he said he carried her body to a stand of trees , walked to a pay phone near the pool of the hotel and , instead of using his cell phone , called a friend who owned a boat that was tied up at a nearby dock . upon the friend 's arrival , the two men carried holloway 's body to the boat , and the friend told van der sloot to go home , he said . the student then walked back to his house , where his father was asleep when he arrived about 15 minutes later , he recounted . he estimated the time at 2:30 or 3 a.m. van der sloot said the boat owner showed up at his house later in the morning and told him he had taken the body out less than a mile from land and dumped it overboard . he added that the incident with the woman has not bothered him . `` i did n't lose a minute of sleep over it , '' he said . the video footage shows van der sloot is `` not innocent , '' holloway 's mother said monday . `` once people see the video , there are no more questions ; there is no one that could walk away from this believing that he is innocent , '' beth twitty told abc . twitty described the video as a source of `` comfort , '' saying `` it means everything . '' `` i felt that it put an end to my nightmare , '' she said . `` the nightmare is not knowing , and i feel as if now , i can begin the mourning and the healing process for losing a child . '' she added , `` not knowing is the absolute cruelest thing that a person can endure . '' van der sloot 's attorney , joe tacopina , told abc monday that `` there 's no confession , there 's no admission of a crime by joran on any of these tapes . '' he said much of what was in the video is `` easily disprovable based on corroborative evidence . ... the fact of the matter is he still is not responsible . the evidence , not joran , the evidence , says he 's not responsible for natalee 's death . '' tacopina added , `` i 'm certainly not asking at this point for anyone to believe joran . ... clearly his credibility is zero . '' last week , van der sloot called the dutch television program `` pauw & witteman '' and acknowledged having made the comments but said they were lies . `` that is what he wanted to hear , so i told him what he wanted to hear , '' van der sloot said . a judge denied a prosecution request that van der sloot , the son of a lawyer , be detained in the netherlands , where he is a student . the judge did determine that sufficient reason exists to reopen the inquiry against van der sloot . watch cnn 's frederik pleitgen report on the new video '' mos said that on tuesday he will appeal the judge 's decision barring van der sloot 's arrest and said that a three-judge panel will have eight days to rule on it . in a statement , the office of the public prosecutor on sunday cautioned the report does not necessarily solve the case . `` there is a big difference between the reality of a courtroom and the reality of a television screen , '' it said . watch a cnn legal analyst discuss the holloway case '' on monday , tacopina said at least two points of his client 's story could be disproved . he said the aruban coast guard had checked the pay phone where van der sloot said he had called his friend , and the records show that `` there 's no such call . '' also , tacopina said , the friend whom his client names in the video met van der sloot two months ago , and the friend was n't in aruba in may 2005 . he also has never owned a boat , the attorney said . van der eem told abc he befriended van der sloot by pretending to be a gangster after meeting him in a casino . `` why did i want this ? it 's obvious . everybody was looking for the truth . for her mother , '' he said . in the interview with abc , van der eem became emotional himself while saying that van der sloot talked about holloway 's death `` without any emotions . '' van der eem , who abc reported once spent a year in prison on drug charges , said he and van der sloot smoked marijuana on long car rides over the course of several months . van der eem told the network he pretended to invite van der sloot into a drug operation to gain his trust . he approached reporter peter r. de vries ' television show , telling them he had gained van der sloot 's trust , and the program outfitted an suv with hidden video cameras . van der eem has been paid about $ 35,000 by the show -- which has a format similar to the u.s. show `` america 's most wanted .

582	derby , england -- substitute emmanuel adebayor struck his second hat-trick against derby this season as arsenal ran riot with a 6-2 premier league victory at pride park . arsenal players celebrate robin van persie 's goal in their comfortable 6-2 victory over derby . the gunners , 5-0 winners at the emirates earlier in the season , made sure of third place in the table with a rousing second-half display against relegated derby , who move closer to being the premier league 's worst-ever side . arsene wenger 's side led 2-1 at the break after goals from nicklas bendtner and robin van persie either side of a jay mceveley effort . theo walcott was on target too , but the second half belonged to togo international striker adebayor , who struck three times to take his season 's tally to 30 in all competitions , with rob earnshaw grabbing a consolation for the hosts in this eight-goal thriller . bottom side derby , now 30 league games without a victory , began the more purposefully and emanuel villa only just failed to connect tyrone mears ' inviting low cross . then mile sterjovski 's drive took a major deflection off alex song to wrong-foot goalkeeper lukasz fabianski , making his first league start for arsenal , only for the ball to creep past the right-hand post . the gunners struggled to find their rhythm early on and were fortunate not to go behind when villa 's bullet header flew just over . derby were made to pay for those early misses when darren moore 's 25th minute mistake presented the ball to niklas bendtner , who played a one-two with robin van persie before coolly slotting the ball into the left corner . however , derby soon scored the equalizer they deserved . robbie savage 's inswinging free-kick landed on the six-yard line and jay mceveley reacted first to hook the ball home . the home side 's joy was short-lived though , when derby 's defensive frailties were exposed again as van persie as given all the time in the world to chest down kolo toure 's floated pass and volley home in style . adebayor replaced van persie for the second-half and arsenal immediately looked intent on adding to their goals tally . twice kolo toure , playing at right-back , fired over , the second opportunity created by cesc fabregas ' brilliant backheel . there was nothing goalkeeper roy carroll could do to deny adebayor arsenal 's third goal . walcott took advantage of alan stubbs ' slip to cut the ball back to emmanuel eboue , who gave adebayor an easy finish . walcott should have made it four when he was put through by bendtner but the teenager fired wide with the goal at his mercy . by now it was looking all too easy for the gunners as they toyed with home side , creating chances at will -- but against the run of play derby reduced the deficit to just a single goal when substitute robert earnshaw stroked the ball home . yet within a minute the two-goal cushion was restored , gael clichy pinging a pinpoint pass to walcott wide on the left before the youngster cut inside and curled into the top-right corner . adebayor grabbed another poacher 's goal , sliding to convert another clichy assist with 10 minutes remaining before he wrapped up his hat-trick from an acute angle in added time . with two games remaining , arsenal are four points behind manchester united and chelsea , still with an outside chance of lifting the premier league title . e-mail to a friend .

584	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- retired adm. william fallon resigned in march as leader of the u.s. military 's central command after reportedly clashing with president bush . retired adm. william fallon told cnn he resigned to maintain confidence in the military chain of command . during an interview tuesday on cnn 's american morning , '' fallon denied a magazine article 's assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with iran . cnn 's kyra phillips asked fallon about his resignation and about u.s. policy regarding iraq and iran . kyra phillips : how were you informed that this was it ? who called you ? fallon : the story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and , i 'm sure , for the president . one of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command . and the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that i was disloyal to the president and that i might be trying to countermand his orders , the policies of the country . ... the fact that people might be concerned that i was not appropriately doing what i was supposed to do and following orders bothered me , and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation . watch fallon break his silence '' phillips : do you feel you were pushed out ? fallon : what was important was not me . it was n't some discussion about where i was with issues . it was the fact that we have a war in progress . we had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in iraq and afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what i might have said or thought or someone perceived i said . that 's the motivation . phillips : -lsb- esquire magazine writer -rsb- tom barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with iran . is that true ? fallon : i do n't believe for a second president bush wants a war with iran . the situation with iran is very complex . people sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms -- we 're against iran , we want to go to war with iran , we want to be close to them . ... the reality is in international politics that -lsb- there are -rsb- many aspects to many of these situations , and i believe in our relationship with iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based . at the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common . phillips : would have you negotiated with iran ? fallon : it 's not my position to negotiate with iran . i was the military commander in the middle east . i had responsibility for our people and their safety and well-being . it 's the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation . phillips : so when talk of the third war came out , a war with iran , the president did n't say to you , `` this is what i want to do , '' and did you stand up and say , `` no , sir . bad move '' ? fallon : it 's probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way . again , do n't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with iran . we have a lot of things going on , and there are many other ways to solve problems . i was very open and candid in my advice . i 'm not shy . i will tell people , the leaders , what i think and offer my opinions on iran and other things , and continue to do that . phillips : do you think that cost you your job ? fallon : no , i do n't believe so at all . it 's a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts , and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be , then we 've got to make a change . phillips : we talk about your no-nonsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president . your critics say that admiral fallon is a difficult man to get along with . are you ? fallon : you probably could ask my wife about that . she would have a few things to say . i think that what 's really important here is that when i was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago , i believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in iraq and afghanistan and in the region . i had some experience in dealing with international problems . i certainly had a lot of combat experience , and i was brought in in an attempt to make things better . that 's what i went about doing . again , there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so . a lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items . the important items were the people , what they 're doing , how to get this job done , how to get the war ended and get our people home . phillips : hillary clinton -lsb- and -rsb- barack obama talk about pulling troops out by next year . john mccain says , no , we 've got to stay the course . what is the best course for iraq right now ? watch what the candidates say about war policy '' fallon : i believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in general dave petraeus and his team out there . dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country . again , this situation is quite complex -- many angles . there 's a very , very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country , but that 's not going to be successful , as we know , without lots of other people playing a hand . the political side of things in iraq has got to move forward . that appears to be improving . people have to have confidence in their futures . they want to have stability . they would like to be able to raise their families in peace . they would like to have a job . they would like to look to tomorrow as better than today . it takes more than the military , but the military is essential to provide stability and security . the idea we would walk away from iraq strikes me as not appropriate . we all want to bring our troops home . we want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended . given where we are today , the progress that they 've made particularly in the last couple months , i think it 's very , very heartening to see what 's really happened here . the right course of action is to continue to work with the iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that 's appropriate to conditions on the ground .

'' mutambara is president of an mdc faction that split from the main party headed by morgan tsvangirai . after tsvangirai 's party won the majority of seats in parliament , the two leaders agreed to join forces in parliament under mutambara 's leadership . both charges stem from an opinion piece written by mutambara in which he criticized president robert mugabe for the way the march 29 elections were handled . raphael khumalo , chief executive of the sunday standard , which published the article , was arrested last month on charges of publishing falsehoods . bush said mugabe 's government is failing on multiple levels . `` we call on the regime to immediately halt all attacks and to permit freedom of assembly , freedom of speech , and access to the media , '' bush said . `` we urge the southern african development community , the african union , the united nations , and other international organizations to blanket the country with election and human rights monitors immediately . '' zimbabwe 's election commission said tsvangirai won the march presidential election , but did n't win a majority of the vote , forcing this month 's vote . the mdc contested the results , saying tsvangirai won outright , but decided to take part in the runoff and not cede the election to mugabe .

'' fulbright scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit and leadership potential under the u.s. government-funded fulbright program , which was started in 1946 . the scholarships allow u.s. citizens and foreign nationals to study and teach abroad to promote the `` mutual understanding between the people of the united states and the people of other countries of the world . '' more than 279,000 participants have been chosen for fulbright scholarships . abukwaik said the e-mail she received sunday gave no indication about when the students might be able to travel . she is waiting to hear back from several universities , including ones in california and florida . she said academic programs start in august and she hopes to have a visa to leave gaza by then . cnn 's atika shubert in gaza city and elise labott in washington contributed to this report .

592	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- from a country which brought the world brands like sony and toyota , there 's another name that 's crept quietly to global prominence . hello kitty , the moon-faced cat with a bow in her hair and no mouth . shintaro tsuji , ceo of sanrio , famous for its hello kitty brand , speaks in the boardroom . she 's one of 450 characters developed by japan 's sanrio group , but she 's by far most popular -- the embodiment of what 's known in japan as kawaii , or the culture of cute . her image adorns some 50,000 objects , from cute , of course , to downright crazy . but there 's nothing cute about the numbers . hello kitty is responsible for more than half of sanrio 's billion dollar annual turnover . her creator and founder of sanrio is the effervescent 79-year-old shintaro tsuji . he told the boardroom 's andrew stevens what he thinks is the marketing secret behind a cultural icon . tsuji : selling something which people want to buy is one of the ways of doing business . but i thought , goods that i want are also something other people want . so we wanted to make goods which people want to send to somebody else as a gift . the idea is that goods are for social communication purposes and that has been accepted worldwide . in addition , to give hello kitty goods as a present is very thoughtful . our three concepts of friendship , cuteness and thoughtfulness have been reaching out to people . it conveys the importance of being friendly . such gestures are necessary for the japanese nation . you care about other people by sending some gifts . those concepts have been accepted worldwide . stevens : my first question to you is sanrio has developed something like 450 characters . why it is hello kitty has stood out so much more than the others ? what is the secret of its success ? tsuji : at first we were using characters which were created by outsiders , such as cartoonists or artists , but in this case we had to pay the royalty . so we decided to create our own characters . we hired many artists and asked them to create various characters . according to our own research , the most popular animal character was a dog then a white cat and the third one was a bear . snoopy already existed as a dog character -- that 's why we went for the second most popular character . we asked the artists to design a character based on a white cat . stevens : let me just ask you a question about your life , growing up . reading your autobiography , you lost your mother when you were 13 years old . you went to live with your auntie . and you describe your life ; your childhood , has been a quite lonely . how do you think that has shaped you in your business life ? tsuji : i felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything ; to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life . then i asked myself how can you make friends -- in what way people can make a friend with those people . that is not just to avoid behaving , which makes people uncomfortable . but do something , which makes people happy . in this way people can make friends . for example , when people are ill , you can say something to them , or when people did something for you , you say thank you to them . for those kinds of occasions , you send a small present rather than an expensive gift . it is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way . this idea has formed as a business . as a result , hello kitty was created . hello kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends . i am pleased with this phenomenon . stevens : what , in your business career , is the most important lesson you think you 've learnt ? tsuji : a good company means that , first of all , its sale increases each year and secondly it makes profits each year . this is what people call a quality company . but this is not my main concern . obviously , a company should n't lose money . a company can not contribute to a society easily . but for me , it is important to establish a company , which has a good reputation . stevens : much easier said than done , how do you remain true to your original ideas , though , because there are so many pressures from shareholders among other people to make those profits ? tsuji : the company shareholders actually say `` make more profits or dividends . '' but what i always say to them at the general assembly is that the shareholder should be someone who truly values my company and is proud of having my company 's share . according to newspapers , there are companies which make a profit by polluting the environment or breaking laws . but this is not acceptable by our standard . i bet the company staffs want to have an increase in the wages . but i want my staffs to be proud of themselves , in particular , when their children ask them where they are working . in my view , that is very important . stevens : what advice would you give to someone starting out their own company in 21st century ? tsuji : it is not only about making profits or establishing a huge corporation . a bigger country does n't mean a better country . having a larger military capacity does n't mean a better thing . it will be ideal to establish a company which is a value to the world . it 's not just about the money . so i would say `` how about creating companies which people appreciate ?

'' the administrative error was verified late saturday morning , kernan said , after a thorough review of olson 's case . he said `` concerns '' about her release date prompted the review . olson was taken into custody at los angeles international airport on friday night , kernan said . olson had been granted interstate parole and was on her way to minnesota , where she lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999 , nickerson had said . from the los angeles airport , authorities took olson to her home in palmdale , california , where she remained until she was arrested midday saturday , when the review was completed , kernan said . originally named kathleen soliah , olson fled california after authorities began looking for her and then changed her name and lived for more than two decades as a fugitive before she was arrested in 1999 in minnesota . she had married and was raising three daughters . many residents rallied to olson 's cause and helped post bail for her . but one group in california , the los angeles police protective league , denounced her release . `` she needs to serve her full time in prison for these crimes and does not deserve time off for working in prison , '' the group said . `` after participating in one killing and attempting two more , she managed to elude authorities and live a guilt-free middle class life for decades . criminals who attempt to murder police officers should not be able to escape justice simply because they have good lawyers .

598	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- artist robert west is proud of his connection to the pullman company . his grandfather , allen parrish , was a pullman porter and helped inspire some of his train paintings . robert west paints his latest project in his atlanta , georgia , studio . `` when i was growing up , we would often take grandfather to work at the train station . i became impressed and mesmerized with trains through this experience . this passion ultimately led me to become a full-time railroad illustrator , '' west said . the pullman company was one of the largest employers of african-americans in the 1920s and '30s . it hired them as porters in railroad sleeping cars to assist railroad passengers and make up beds . these jobs were once highly regarded in the black community because they offered the opportunity to travel and better pay and security than most jobs open to blacks at the time . west says trains have an important place in african-american history -- from symbolism in negro spirituals to a real conveyance for the mass migration of blacks moving to the north in the 1930s , '40s and '50s . `` trains have so long symbolized hope , freedom and power -- what better metaphor could there be to represent our struggle and our assimilation into mainstream american life , '' west said . many of west 's paintings depict historical scenes with the now defunct atlantic coast line railroad , because that 's where his grandfather worked for many years . watch award-winning artist on trains and history '' west paints other trains , including the steam , gas turbine , electric , as well as first through sixth generation diesel electric locomotives . he wears a conductor 's hat as he works . `` i think it 's important that all the cultures in the united states look back at our history by way of the railroads , '' west said . `` it was through our contributions to the railroads , that also pushed us forward as a nation and as a human race . '' west has been drawing and painting trains since the age of 2 . in 1973 , he decided to make railroad illustrating a profession . through the years his work has won several awards in shows of national and regional scope . `` i 'm probably more of a visual historian more than anything else , because i conduct weeks , months , sometimes years of research prior to doing a painting , '' he said . west has painted more than 500 original works , which have sold across the united states and around the world . train enthusiasts are his largest market . `` when one looks at my paintings , i like for them to not only feel a sense of joy , but to feel good about times when times were happier , kinder , and gentler , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .
599	kiev , ukraine -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a planned missile defense system in eastern europe poses no threat to russia , president george bush said tuesday , responding to concerns that the u.s. might use interceptor missiles for offensive purposes . president bush , with president viktor yushchenko , praised ukraine 's democratic and military reforms . `` the missile defense system is not aimed at russia , '' bush said at a news conference in kiev following talks with the ukrainian president . `` it 's viewed as an anti-russian device . well , it 's not . '' his comments came before he left kiev for a nato summit in bucharest , romania , that is expected to highlight divisions over the plan . the summit begins wednesday . russia and some european countries have expressed concerns about the missile defense system . while poland and the czech republic have agreed to host parts of the system , others in europe share russian concerns that the defensive shield could be used for offensive aims . outside the u.s. embassy in kiev on monday , protesters gathered to denounce bush 's visit . they chanted , thrust signs into the air -- one reading , `` yankee go home '' -- and burned an effigy of bush in the street . watch the demonstration '' the u.s. has tried to dissuade opposition over the plan . washington offered to allow russian monitors at the missile sites and to negotiate limits to the system over time . the united states also told russia the system would not be operational until iran test-fires a missile that could threaten europe . many european countries do n't believe the u.s. assertion that the system is needed to guard against imminent threats from iran or north korea . europe is dependent on russia for at least 40 percent of its oil and is reluctant to upset the kremlin . the issue will likely be divisive at this week 's three-day nato summit , where russian president vladimir putin plans to make a rare appearance . putin normally declines invitations to attend . bush is slated to meet sunday with putin in the russian resort city of sochi on the black sea , according to ria novosti . it will be the last meeting between the two men before the outgoing russian president steps down , the russian news agency reported . russia also is unhappy with nato 's eastward march . the alliance has already welcomed former soviet republics such as latvia , lithuania and estonia . bush is pushing hard for georgia and ukraine to join nato as well . before leaving tuesday for bucharest , bush said that russia will not be able to veto georgia 's or ukraine 's inclusion into nato . bush said that both countries should be able to take part in nato 's membership action plan , or map , which is designed to help aspiring countries meet the requirements of joining the alliance . `` i strongly believe that ukraine and georgia should be given map , '' bush said . `` and there 's no tradeoffs , period . '' the u.s. president further said he was working `` as hard as i can '' to ensure the two countries are accepted into the map and that russia will have no power to block their inclusion . in remarks last month , former u.s. ambassador to ukraine steven pifer told the u.s. commission on security and cooperation in europe that nato `` has long made clear that any decision regarding membership is between nato and the country concerned , and not subject to veto by any third party . '' russia is not a nato member but works with the alliance via the nato-russia council . russia 's concerns also align with those of some nato members who oppose welcoming georgia and ukraine into the fold . pifer said last month that nato should strive to maintain good relations with russia , but `` should not allow moscow a veto , either explicit or tacit , over relations between the alliance and third countries . '' allowing russia a say , pifer said , `` would encourage those in russia who wish to reassert a russian-led post-soviet bloc rather than develop a relationship of cooperation and full partnership with europe and the west . '' bush said he phoned putin recently to reassure him on both issues . `` nato is an organization that 's peaceful . nato is an organization that helps democracies flourish . and democracies are good things to have on your border , '' bush said he told putin . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said his country should be able to start the nato membership process . `` we are not speaking about joining nato ; we are only speaking about map , '' he said at the news conference . `` why should ukraine be deprived of that sovereign right , since the principle of open doors is the basic principle for nato ? '' bush added that ukraine already contributes to nato missions , specifically in iraq , afghanistan and kosovo . ukraine also has demonstrated a commitment to democracy , he said . responding to a reporter 's question , bush denied that the united states might ease off on membership plans for ukraine and georgia if russia acquiesces on the missile shield . both issues threaten to destabilize nato , said jane sharp of the center for war studies at king 's college london , but she has heard particularly sharp criticism of the missile defense plan . `` somebody in the uk ministry of defense said to me , ` we are being dragged along on this missile defense thing to the american trough like pigs with rings in our noses , ' '' sharp said . `` it 's a nuisance for europeans , and i think they are irritated with the czechs and the poles for trying to do deals with the americans .

600	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the rev. jeremiah wright on monday said the black church , not him , had been subjected to attacks in the 2008 presidential campaign . speaking before the national press club , sen. barack obama 's former pastor sought to give insight into the black church and clarify some of his remarks that have sparked a firestorm . earlier this year , some of wright 's sermons , circulated and widely discussed on the internet and on television , became an issue in the democratic presidential race because of the former pastor 's ties to obama . wright is a retired pastor from the trinity united church of christ in chicago , illinois , where obama worships . in one sermon , wright said the u.s. had brought the september 11 attacks upon itself and said `` america 's chickens are coming home to roost . '' asked to explain those remarks , wright said , `` have you heard the whole sermon ? ... no , you have n't heard the whole sermon . that nullifies that question . '' watch as wright explains his 9/11 comments '' wright said those who heard the entire sermon would have known that he was quoting the ambassador from iraq and keeping in line with biblical principles . `` jesus said , ` do unto others as you would have them do unto you . ' you can not do terrorism on other people and expect it never to come back on you . those are biblical principles , not jeremiah wright bombastic principles , '' he said . watch as wright questions his critics ' patriotism '' wright shot back at the notion that obama has walked away from him , saying the candidate `` distanced himself from some of my remarks . ... he had to distance himself , because he 's a politician , from what the media was saying i had said , which was un-american . '' obama , when asked what he could do to keep wright 's latest comments from dragging him down , replied : . `` i think people will understand that i am not perfect and that there are going to be folks in my past like rev. wright that may cause them some concern -- but that ultimately , my 20 years of service and the values that i 've written about and spoken about and promoted are their values and what they 're concerned about . and that 's what this camp has been about and what it 's going to continue to be about . '' wright said sound bites from his sermons were taken out of context and said the black religious tradition , despite its long history , is in some ways `` invisible to the dominant culture . '' the theology of the black church is a `` theology of liberation , it is a theology of transformation and it is ultimately a theology of reconciliation , '' he said . wright 's remarks came a day after he addressed an audience of 10,000 at a dinner sponsored by the detroit chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people . watch as wright answers his critics at the naacp event '' reiterating some of the same points from that dinner , wright said , `` being different does not mean one is deficient -- it simply means one is different , like snowflakes . '' wright said reconciliation means `` we embrace our individual rich histories . '' he said it also means rooting out `` any teaching of superiority , inferiority , hatred or prejudice '' and recognizing that each person `` is one of god 's children ... no better , no worse . '' `` only then will liberation , transformation and reconciliation become realities and cease being ever-elusive ideals , '' he said . at the height of the wright controversy , obama gave a speech on race relations , rejecting his ex-pastor 's controversial comments but saying he could not repudiate the man himself . `` i 'm not here for political reasons , '' wright said sunday . `` i am not a politician . i know that fact will surprise many of you because many in the corporate-owned media have made it seem as if i had announced that i 'm running for the oval office . i am not running for the oval office . `` i 've been running for jesus a long , long time , and i 'm not tired yet . '' sen. john mccain , the presumptive gop nominee , weighed in on the controversy monday , saying he does not think obama and wright share the same `` extremist views . '' watch mccain comment on wright '' mccain on sunday broached the topic of wright unprompted for the first time despite previous suggestions the issue would be out of bounds in the presidential race . mccain said his shifting stance was justified because obama told `` fox news sunday '' the controversy surrounding his ex-pastor was `` a legitimate political issue . '' the senator from arizona last week told the north carolina gop not to run an ad linking the state 's democratic candidates for governor -- richard moore and beverly perdue , both obama supporters -- to wright . but on monday , mccain said he would no longer get involved in such matters . `` i will not be a referee , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .

602	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- zimbabwe 's capital of harare was quiet saturday night after polls began closing for elections that will decide the future of longtime president robert mugabe . zimbabwean president robert mugabe campaigns in the capital of harare last week . results were not expected until sunday . the main opposition party , movement for democratic change , alleged widespread irregularities and promised to release its own election results , defying a government order . critics of the government have predicted that the elections will be rigged or marred by fraud , though the government has promised that they will be `` free and fair . '' at a news conference in harare , movement for democratic change secretary-general tenda biti said that some of the party 's agents have been chased away from polling stations . the party also said the zimbabwe electoral commission claimed to have lost the accreditation for agents at 19 stations and refused to let them in . biti said there was a `` massive '' deployment of soldiers and police at most stations . journalists inside the country reported a heavy presence of the army and police but disagreed with biti 's description of it as `` massive . '' police said they were investigating the bombing of a house in harare belonging to a parliamentarian candidate from mugabe 's ruling zanu-pf party . the bombing happened early saturday , and it was not immediately clear whether it was connected to the elections , police said . no one was inside the home at the time . the zimbabwean government has denied cnn and other international news organizations permission to enter the country to report on the elections . read about reporting on the elections . the elections are posing one of the toughest challenges to mugabe 's 28-year rule . two candidates , both from different factions of the opposition party , stand a good chance of unseating him . one opposition contender is movement for democratic change founder morgan tsvangirai , who fought hotly contested challenges against the president in 2000 , 2002 and 2005 . the other is mugabe 's former finance minister , simba makoni . he was a member of the zanu-pf party until he announced his bid to unseat mugabe and the party kicked him out . voter turnout was high after the polls opened at 7 a.m. -lrb- 1 a.m. et -rrb- , journalists reported , but it tapered off throughout the day . shortly before polls closed at 7 p.m. -lrb- 1 p.m. et -rrb- , `` there was a rush of people to put in their last-minute votes '' in some places , media rights activist reyhana masters said . biti also said police were assisting many voters in casting ballots . the opposition has spoken out against `` assistance '' in the voting booth , calling it an intimidation tactic , but mugabe passed a presidential decree this week that said police could help those voters who are elderly or infirm . watch zimbabweans worry their vote wo n't count '' the government has warned the opposition not to release its own election results , saying that doing so is the role of the electoral commission and could spark violence of the kind seen in kenya after elections there late last year . some zimbabweans reported irregularities in saturday 's voting . eddie matsangaise of the zimbabwe exile forum said he had heard that the names of long-dead white colonialist leaders were on voter lists , but voters who thought they were registered were turned away . iden wetherell , editor of the newspaper zimbabwe independent , said the opposition had found large numbers of voters registered at one address where there is n't a building . voter confusion was also a problem . the elections are not just for president but also for parliamentary , senate and local council seats , meaning voters have to cast a number of ballots in a limited amount of time . limited voter education means many registered voters were not told which ward to go to and may turn up at the wrong polling stations . watch claims of dead voters still on the rolls '' the absence of international media and independent observers has heightened critics ' concerns . the united states this week warned of a possible unfair election , and new york-based human rights watch warned this month that the elections were likely to be `` deeply flawed . '' human rights watch said in a report that zimbabwe 's electoral commission is partisan toward zanu-pf and lacks both expertise and resources to run the elections properly . an mdc official said this week that leaked correspondence from the electoral commission showed it had asked for 3.3 million more ballots than there are registered voters , including 250,000 extra postal ballots for soldiers and police . tenda biti , the opposition 's secretary-general , said it was an indication of fraud . a hero of the country 's civil war against the white rhodesian government , mugabe became the country 's first black prime minister in 1980 . but nearly three decades later , he has consolidated his rule over all aspects of zimbabwean life , and the country does not appear better for it . his country was once revered for offering its citizens some of the best education and health care in africa , but now , schooling is a luxury and zimbabwe has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world . zimbabwe was once known as the breadbasket of southern africa , but now it is difficult to get even basic food supplies . inflation has skyrocketed to more than 100,000 percent while food production and agricultural exports have dropped drastically . watch reasons for meltdown of zimbabwe 's economy '' part of the economic freefall is traced to mugabe 's land redistribution policies , including his controversial seizure of commercially white-owned farms in 2000 . mugabe gave the land to black zimbabweans who he said were cheated under colonialist rule , and white farmers who resisted were jailed . in 2005 , mugabe launched operation clean out the trash , in which he razed slum areas across the country . mugabe denies mismanagement and blames his country 's woes on the west , saying that sanctions have harmed the economy . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's robyn curnow in beitbridge , south africa , contributed to this report .

604	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a high school valedictorian 's plans to study medicine at a california state university have run headlong into the federal government 's attempts to return him and his family to armenia . arthur mkoyan , 17 , was 2 years old when his family came to the united states . `` i have n't been in armenia since i was 2 , so i do n't really know anything about the place , '' said arthur mkoyan , 17 . `` all i 've seen is just videos my mom has watched on the internet . '' mkoyan 's long-term plans were turned upside down one morning in april when two immigration officers arrived at the door of his family 's house . `` they took both of my parents , and they released my mom because she had to take care of us , since me and my brother are minors , '' he recalled . `` but instead they took my dad away to a detention center in arizona .

'' in what the family considers one such attempt , their house was set on fire in 1992 . that led the father to send his family to russia and then to the united states , arthur mkoyan said . they arrived in the united states in 1995 on six-month tourist visas , according to virginia kice , a public information officer with immigration and customs enforcement . the family settled in fresno , where mkoian worked as a truck driver and his wife worked in a jewelry store . they set about living their lives , which soon included a younger brother for arthur . but after the visas expired , the family 's application to remain in the united states was denied . in 2002 , an immigration judge ruled that they had no legal basis to remain in the country , kice said . after their application to the board of immigration appeals was rejected , the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals last year denied their petition for a hearing . the court was unpersuaded by the father 's assertion that he might still be subject to reprisal if he were to return . `` mkoian 's fear that armenian officials would be unable or unwilling to protect him seems unfounded because he provided little evidence that they were unable or unwilling to protect him in the past , '' the appeals court said . to kice , it 's a simple matter of enforcing the law . `` i would remind people that this family had ample access to due process , '' she said . `` the case has been in litigation for more than 10 years . immigration experts on every level determined that they had no legal basis to be in the united states . '' she noted that the government agreed to delay their deportation so arthur can graduate with his class . arthur 's schoolmates at bullard are shocked that his academic achievements have n't helped his case . `` it 's really hard to get good grades in this school , '' freshman alex stewart told affiliate kgpe . `` it 's a challenging school , so to get a 4.0 , you really got ta try . '' still , a longer-term reprieve remains possible , if unlikely . sen. dianne feinstein , d-california , may attempt to pass a `` private bill '' that would allow the family to remain in the united states . `` our office is looking into the case , '' said scott gerber , a spokesman for the senator . but the odds against it are long . there is `` almost no chance '' that the family 's quest for a private bill will succeed , said daniel kowalski , editor-in-chief of bender 's immigration bulletin . `` very few are being passed , '' he said . in fact , of the 21 private immigration bills introduced last year , none was enacted . in 2006 , 117 were introduced , and none was enacted ; in 2005 , 98 were introduced , and four were enacted . but the filing itself would buy the family time , since it suspends any efforts to deport the family until the bill 's fate is determined . arthur appeared undaunted . he appealed to a reporter to publicize his e-mail address -lrb- artmkoyan@gmail.com -rrb- so he can forward any letters of support to feinstein . meanwhile , the academic skills he has displayed in fresno may not easily translate to college in armenia . arthur said he understands only a few words of armenian .

608	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- mychal bell , a black teenager accused of beating a white classmate and who was the last of the `` jena 6 '' behind bars , was released from custody thursday after a juvenile court judge set his bail at $ 45,000 . supporters surround mychal bell on thursday after his release at the lasalle parish courthouse . bell 's release followed an announcement from lasalle parish district attorney reed walters , who said he would not appeal a higher court 's decision moving bell 's case to juvenile court . wearing a blue striped golf shirt and jeans , bell walked out of the lasalle parish courthouse a week after an estimated 15,000-plus demonstrators marched through jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- to protest local authorities ' handling of the teens ' case . `` we do not condone violence of any kind , but we ask that people be given a fair and even chance at the bar of justice , '' the rev. al sharpton said outside the courthouse . `` tonight , mychal can go home , but mychal is not out of the juvenile process . he goes home because a lot of people left their home and stood up for him , '' he said . `` let america know -- we are not fighting for the right to fight in school . we 're not fighting for the right for kids to beat each other . we 're fighting to say that there must be one level of justice for everybody . and you can not have adult attempted murder for some , and a fine for others , and call that equal protection under the law . two wrongs do n't make one civil right . '' demonstrators at last week 's march were protesting how authorities handled the cases of bell and five other teens accused of beating fellow student justin barker . many said they were angry that the students , dubbed the jena 6 , were being treated more harshly than three white students who hung nooses from an oak tree on jena high school property . the white students were suspended from school but did not face criminal charges . the protesters said they should have been charged with a hate crime . bell 's attorney lewis scott said the teen was moved from jail to a juvenile facility earlier thursday . walters said his decision not to appeal was based on what he believed was best for the victim in the case . `` while i believe that a review would have merit ... i believe it is in the best interest of the victim and his family not to delay this matter any further and move it to its conclusion , '' walters told reporters . watch the rev. al sharpton discuss the teen 's release '' he said last week 's march , which included sharpton and martin luther king iii , did not influence his decision . bell , now 17 , was the only one of the jena 6 behind bars . his bond previously was set at $ 90,000 . a district judge earlier this month tossed out bell 's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery , saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court . the 3rd circuit court of appeal in lake charles , louisiana , did the same with bell 's battery conviction in mid-september . prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating barker with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy . walters reduced charges against at least four of them -- bell , robert bailey jr. , carwin jones and theo shaw -- to battery and conspiracy . bryant purvis awaits arraignment . charges against jesse ray beard , who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime , are unavailable because he 's a juvenile . wednesday , gov. kathleen blanco announced that louisiana state police officers will protect the families of the jena 6 and investigate any threats they have received . a white supremacist web site posted the names and addresses of the six black teens after last week 's march , calling on followers to `` let them know justice is coming . '' thursday , the fbi said it had been made aware of allegations of threats . `` threats are taken seriously , and as these investigations are ongoing we can not comment further , '' said sheila thorne of the fbi 's office in new orleans , louisiana . the december 4 attack on barker came after months of racial tension , including at least two instances of fighting in the town , sparked originally when three white teens hung the nooses . walters has said there was no direct link between the hanging of the nooses and the schoolyard attack , and defended the prosecutions ahead of last thursday 's peaceful march . blanco defended the prosecutor wednesday , saying , `` he has a solid record and is highly respected among his peers . '' walters also addressed the stress and notoriety the town has been subjected to , saying the only way he and other residents `` have been able to endure the trauma that has been thrust upon us is through the prayers of the christian people who have sent them up in this community . '' he also suggested that some kind of `` disaster '' was averted when thousands of marchers came to jena last week . `` i firmly believe and am confident of the fact that had it not been for the direct intervention of the lord jesus christ last thursday , a disaster would have happened , '' walters said . `` the lord jesus christ put his influence on those people , and they responded accordingly , '' he said , without explaining exactly what he meant . soon after the district attorney spoke , a local reverend took issue with his comments . `` obviously , we are serving two different gods here , '' the rev. donald sidley said . `` my bible says that we should do -- we should be loving , love your neighbor as yourself . `` for him to try and separate the community like he is and then using christ jesus to influence the people that jesus is working on their side , well , that 's -- that 's absurd . ... god is god of the human race , '' said sidley , of the new evergreen church . e-mail to a friend .

610	khartoum , sudan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sudan 's entire state apparatus has been mobilized `` to plan , commit , and cover up crimes '' in the war-torn area of darfur , a prosecutor for the international criminal court said thursday . the united nations estimates 2.5 million people have been forced from their homes in darfur . the prosecutor , luis moreno-ocampo , made the observation in a progress report to the u.n. security council into its probe of crimes in darfur and the status of two men indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the darfur region of sudan . he said the sudanese government `` has taken no steps to arrest '' the men , one of whom is now in charge of the government 's humanitarian affairs . the other is a militia leader . `` for the last five years the whole darfur area has been a crime scene . girls are raped , schools are bombed . ... and they are covering up these crimes , '' moreno-ocampo said at a news conference at the united nations thursday . the court says darfurians are attacked in their villages and in camps , citing rapes , bombings of schools and arrests of community leaders . `` crimes being committed today in darfur can not be denied , or minimized . decisions to commit crimes , to deny crimes , to disguise crimes are taken at the highest level . denial of crimes , by the authorities that vowed to protect darfurians , is an additional harm to the victims , '' the report said . the icc cases are against ali kushayb , a militia leader , and ahmad harun , former minister of state for the interior in sudan , who is now in charge of humanitarian affairs for the sudanese government . both face charges of murder , rape , forced displacement and other offenses during the darfur crisis , which the united states characterizes as a genocide . harun 's present role gives him power over how and whether aid agencies can deliver food , medicine and shelter to victims of chronic violence and deprivation in darfur . `` he attacks the people he has the responsibility to protect , '' the international criminal court said in a statement . `` he hampers the delivery of relief to the victims . he is involved in obstructing deployment of the peacekeepers . '' alleged crimes in the region stem from a brutal counter-insurgency campaign the sudanese government conducted after rebels began an uprising in the darfur region of western sudan in 2003 . the authorities armed and cooperated with arab militias that went from village to village in darfur on a campaign of killing , torture and rape , according to the united nations , western governments and human-rights organizations . the militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels draw strength . about 300,000 people have died in darfur , the united nations estimates , and 2.5 million have been forced from home . in 2005 , the security council cleared the way for possible war crimes prosecutions by the international criminal court , a permanent tribunal set up to handle prosecutions related to genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . the court is based on a treaty signed by 106 nations -- excluding sudan . prosecutors are investigating offenses in sudan , the democratic republic of the congo , uganda and the central african republic . once the court indicts someone , authorities in one country or another have the power to detain the indicted person for trial at the hague . that has not happened in the case of harun and kushayb . an arrest warrant for harun charges that he was involved in the murder , rape , torture and forced displacement of civilians . the court also says he encouraged such illegal acts in public speeches during his tenure as minister of state for the interior . the criminal court says kushayb led several thousand militia members and personally participated in attacks against civilians . an arrest warrant outlines numerous cases of murder , rape and inhumane acts . in sudan , however , senior government leaders told cnn that reports of atrocities in darfur were exaggerated . `` yes , there has been a war and some people have died , but it 's not like what has been reflected in the media , '' said interior minister ibrahim mahmoud hamid . musa halil , an adviser to sudan 's president , has been accused by the united states of leading a militia responsible for atrocities . and the u.n. security council has frozen his assets . yet he denies any wrongdoing . `` there is no genocide , '' he told cnn . `` most people came to the refugee camps because of the pressure and were used there for political marketing . '' others told a different story . in darfur , eyewitnesses spoke of government airplanes and helicopters attacking defenseless civilians just four months ago . they said the government struck in coordination with militiamen riding horses and camels -- a classic pattern that has unfolded around darfur in recent years . more than 115 people were killed in that attack , they said , and nearly 58,000 people fled . cnn 's nic robertson contributed to this report .

612	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- after months of stalemate , the senate late tuesday passed a huge government spending bill that includes billions of dollars requested by president bush to continue the war in iraq . white house officials have said president bush would sign off on the spending plan if the iraq money was added . the roughly $ 555 billion bill -- which passed 76-17 -- also preserves thousands of earmarks for lawmakers who will deliver them to constituents just in time for the holidays . the final vote came at about 11 p.m. et tuesday -- after hours of debate that included two more attempts by senate democrats to tie war funding to a plan to withdraw u.s. troops from iraq . those efforts failed , as have dozens of others in the house and senate since democrats took control of congress last year . earlier , members voted to add $ 40 billion for the war in iraq that had been removed by the house -- which passed the spending bill on monday . the plan also includes $ 30 billion for troops in afghanistan . sen. joe lieberman , an independent from connecticut who co-sponsored the push to reinstate the iraq money , called its approval `` a very powerful bipartisan message of support for our men and women serving in iraq . '' white house officials have said bush would sign the spending plan if the iraq money was added . in the weeks leading up to the vote , bush had repeatedly pushed members of congress to approve a military spending bill that did not place troop-withdrawal requirements on the military in iraq . the bill wraps together 11 of the 12 government spending bills for 2008 -- except for that of the department of defense , which was already funded . facing a president determined to keep spending in check and a unified republican minority in the house and senate , democrats have been stymied at nearly every turn in their attempts to increase spending on their domestic priorities . fearing a politically dangerous government shutdown , democratic leaders ultimately gave in to bush 's top line number and trimmed $ 22 billion from the measure . but democrats stemmed their losses somewhat by shifting some funding from the president 's priorities to their own . and they added billions more above bush 's top line in `` emergency '' funding for veterans health care , california fires , border security and more . the government spending watchdog group taxpayers for common sense , which scrambled monday to pore over the nearly 1,500-page bill that was made public late sunday night , said it has identified almost 9,000 earmarks worth $ 7.4 billion . many of the earmarks avoided normal congressional scrutiny and were `` airdropped '' -- or slipped in without going through normal committee consideration -- into the final bill , the group said . but sen. robert byrd , d-west virginia , chairman of the budget-writing appropriations committee , said the spending plan represents a dramatic decrease in pork-barrel projects from the one approved by bush two years ago -- when republicans controlled congress . `` the total dollars that are earmarked is reduced -- hear me now -- by 43 percent , '' byrd said tuesday from the senate floor . `` that ai n't chicken feed . '' arguing for a plan that would have begun pulling troops from iraq within 90 days , sen. edward kennedy , d-massachusetts , became emotional as he called the bush administration 's efforts in iraq `` a continuing quagmire . '' `` the best way to end this charade and protect our troops and our national security is to put the iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for their future , '' kennedy said . `` unless there 's a binding timeline for the redeployment of our troops , the iraqis will not feel the need to make the compromises essential for a political solution . '' the measure now goes back to the house for approval in its revised form . house speaker nancy pelosi said she expects the bill to pass the house , although she will vote against it because of the war funds added in the senate version . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ted barrett contributed to this report .

614	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- for years , russian arms dealer viktor bout made millions of dollars delivering weapons and ammunition to warlords and militants , officials say . on thursday , bout and his associate , andrew smulian , were arrested in thailand after a series of events that officials said could have come straight out of a spy novel . the men 's capture involved law enforcement agencies from at least five countries , including two undercover agents from the u.s. drug enforcement administration posing as colombian rebels . bout and smulian are accused of conspiracy to provide surface-to-air missiles and other weapons to colombian rebels , said michael garcia , u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york . in a complaint filed by a dea agent , they are said to have conspired to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , or farc . the u.s. department of state designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 2003 . `` this marks the end of the reign of one of the world 's most-wanted arms traffickers , '' garcia said of bout . `` someone will undoubtedly write a book about this case someday , and i can tell you that it will read like the very best work of tom clancy , only in this case , it wo n't be fiction , '' said michael braun , assistant administrator and chief of operations for the dea . secret meetings . the operation began in january , when smulian began meeting with two men who claimed to represent farc but who were actually confidential sources working for the dea . the men expressed interest in buying millions of dollars worth of weapons . at meetings in the netherlands antilles , denmark and romania , smulian discussed the details and logistics of the arms deal with the two agents . at one meeting , the agents were given a digital memory stick containing an article about bout and documents containing photos and specifications for 100 surface-to-air missiles and armor-piercing rocket launchers . smulian explained that a delivery system was in place that would allow the weapons to be air-dropped into colombia , and he told the men that it would cost $ 5 million to transport the weapons . during one meeting , smulian introduced the dea sources to bout over the phone . after that conversation , smulian told one of the sources that the weapons were ready in bulgaria . smulian and bout set up a face-to-face meeting with them to finalize the deal , and that is what happened thursday . the arrests were made thursday afternoon . the charges against bout and smulian cover the period from november through february , according to a written statement from the u.s. attorney 's office and the dea . the united states plans to pursue the extradition of bout from thailand , the statement said . there was no mention of smulian 's fate . bout and smulian are charged with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . if convicted , each could get a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison , the statement said . ` i 'm not a diamond guy ' intelligence agencies around the world have tracked bout for years . although some of his work has been legitimate , most has not . he has made deliveries to africa , asia and the mideast using obsolete or surplus soviet-era cargo planes . bout , a former soviet air force officer who speaks multiple languages , has what is reputed to be the largest private fleet of soviet-era cargo aircraft in the world , according to u.s. officials . he acquired the planes shortly after the breakup of the soviet union , the u.s. department of the treasury said in 2005 . at that time , the u.s. treasury announced that it was freezing the assets of bout and his associates , who are all tied to former liberian president charles taylor . taylor is being tried on war crimes charges by the special court for sierra leone . intelligence officials said bout shipped large quantities of small arms to civil wars across africa and asia , often taking diamonds in payment from west african fighters . a 2006 article in foreign policy magazine said that although bout served many third-world leaders , he also aided organizations such as the united nations . `` he made countless trips for the united nations into the same areas where he supplied the weapons that sparked the humanitarian crises in the first place , '' the article charged . it said bout probably committed multiple violations of u.n. arms embargoes . british intelligence officials found evidence in afghanistan that bout had shipped arms to the taliban and al qaeda , as well as circumstantial evidence that he shipped weapons technology into iraq . and the u.s. government said it received information that bout profited $ 50 million from supplying the taliban with military equipment when they ruled afghanistan . bout , who is said to be the inspiration for nicolas cage 's arms dealer character in the movie `` lord of war , '' told cnn in 2002 that he never sold arms to the taliban or al qaeda . he also denied providing weapons and missile-guidance technology to iraq . bout said that his air transport company is legitimate and that he ferried a variety of cargo to africa and to afghanistan since 1992 . he denied that any of it was done illegally or that he was paid in `` blood diamonds '' from africa . `` it 's a lie , '' he said . `` i never touched diamonds in my life , and i 'm not a diamond guy , and i do n't want to go into that business .

616	london , england -- a colombian sculptor has created a mystery at london 's tate modern gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor . `` shibboleth '' is colombian artist doris salcedo 's first public commission in the united kingdom . the work by doris salcedo begins as a hairline crack then widens and deepens as it snakes across the full 167 meters -lrb- 548 feet -rrb- of the former power station 's turbine hall . salcedo said `` shibboleth , '' a statement about racism , took her more than a year to make but has revealed little else about its construction . she apparently created it elsewhere and spent the past five weeks installing it in the tate , on the south bank of the river thames . she refused to say how she managed seemingly to crack open a concrete floor . `` what is important is the meaning of the piece . the making of it is not important , '' she said . asked how deep the crack goes , she replied : `` it 's bottomless . it 's as deep as humanity . '' visitors meanwhile are warned not to trip on the crack . tate director nicholas serota insisted the work was no optical illusion . `` this sculpture has been made in the most painstaking , meticulous way by doris and her team before it was slowly inserted into the turbine hall , '' he told the press association . `` it has taken five weeks of work here with very considerable disruption to the hall . it 's not an illusion - it 's there , it 's real . `` from the tate 's point of view , there were only two questions : could we realize it in the way doris envisaged ? and once the piece was created , would it damage the structural integrity of the building forever ? `` the answer to the first was yes , and to the second was no . '' he declined to elaborate further . the installation will be removed next april by filling in the crack . serota said : `` there is a crack , there is a line , and eventually there will be a scar and that scar will remain . it will remain as a memory of the work and also as a memorial to the issues doris touches on . '' the artist said the work of art represents the gap between white europeans and the rest of humanity . wire mesh is on show because it is `` the most common means of control used to define borders and divisions . '' salcedo said of the work : `` it represents borders , the experience of immigrants , the experience of segregation , the experience of racial hatred . `` it is the experience of a third world person coming into the heart of europe . `` for example , the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space . and so this piece is a negative space .

617	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- u.s. health officials said wednesday they have found a contaminant in a blood-thinning drug produced by baxter healthcare corp. that has been linked to more than a dozen deaths in the united states . the drug can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins , arteries , and lungs . in early february , the food and drug administration launched an investigation and then a recall of some forms of the product . the scrutiny began after a spike in reports of health problems associated with heparin , a drug made by baxter from pig intestines at plants in china and wisconsin . though the cause of the problems has not been determined , fda investigators found `` a heparin-like compound -- that is not heparin -- present in some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients '' in both facilities , said dr. janet woodcock , acting director of the fda 's center for drug evaluation and research . the contaminant , which made up 5 percent to 20 percent of each sample tested , `` reacts like heparin in some of the conventional tests used for heparin , '' which explains why it was not picked up , she told reporters in a conference call . no causal link between the contaminant and the adverse events has been established yet , woodcock said . she added that it was not clear whether the contaminant was added accidentally , as part of the processing or deliberately . it also was not clear whether the contaminant was introduced in the company 's plant in wisconsin or the one in china , woodcock said . though she said the exact structure of the contaminant has not been identified , `` it is similar to heparin glycans . '' glycans are polysaccharides , a complex class of carbohydrate . she added it was unclear whether other heparin products used outside the united states might also contain the product . later this week , the agency will release recommendations on how manufacturers and regulators can screen for the contaminant , she said . last year , pet food made in china was found to be tainted with an ingredient that replaced more expensive protein and that initial tests did not identify as a contaminant . asked if the heparin contamination could be a similar case , woodcock said , `` it 's possible . '' doctors have used the blood-thinner for 60 years with `` no history of any problems whatsoever , '' said the fda commissioner , dr. andrew c. von eschenbach . its intravenous use can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins , arteries and lungs . von eschenbach said it would be `` disingenuous '' to expect the agency would be able to inspect `` every institution in every case . '' over the last fiscal year , the agency reported having inspected more than 1,000 foreign plants , a record . since the agency issued its report that 19 deaths had been linked to the drug since january 1 , 2007 , it has received word of another 27 deaths , `` but many of those do not fit our definition of this type of event , '' woodcock said . in all , the fda has received 785 heparin-linked reports of adverse events -- including difficulty breathing , nausea , vomiting , excessive sweating and plummeting blood pressure that can lead to life-threatening shock . `` they 're continuing to come in fairly rapidly because there has been a lot of reporting of this , '' she said . in a written statement , baxter said its tests have suggested `` that the root cause may be associated with the crude heparin , sourced from china , or from the subsequent processing of that product before it reaches baxter . '' meanwhile , scientific protein laboratories llc , which supplies the company with the active pharmaceutical ingredients , issued a statement saying it is working with the fda , baxter and outside experts to identify the cause of the adverse events . `` thus far , no conclusions have been reached about the root cause , '' it said . `` it is premature to conclude that the heparin active pharmaceutical ingredient sourced from china and provided by spl to baxter is responsible for these adverse events . '' it said that its voluntary recall of suspect product was being made as a precaution . e-mail to a friend .
618	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal drug investigators have taken over the inquiry into the january 22 death of actor heath ledger in a new york apartment , a law enforcement source told cnn thursday . actor heath ledger , 28 , died january 22 at an apartment in lower manhattan . ledger , 28 , an oscar-nominated australian actor , died of an accidental overdose of six types of medication , according to the new york city medical examiner 's office . the medical examiner 's office said ledger `` died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone , hydrocodone , diazepam , temazepam , alprazolam and doxylamine . '' oxycodone and hydrocodone are pain medications ; diazepam -- also known as valium -- is used to treat anxiety ; temazepam is a sedative used to induce sleep ; alprazolam -- known by the trade name xanax -- is an anti-anxiety agent . doxylamine , an antihistamine , can be obtained over the counter as a sleep aid . the law enforcement source said the federal drug investigators are trying to determine if the drugs were prescribed legally , and are looking at two doctors -- one based in california and another in texas . ledger 's first american film was the teen comedy `` 10 things i hate about you '' in 1999 . he passed up several scripts before taking a role in the revolutionary war drama `` the patriot '' in 2000 and `` a knight 's tale '' in 2001 . he also played a supporting role in `` monster 's ball . '' but ledger was perhaps best known for his portrayal of ennis del mar in `` brokeback mountain , '' ang lee 's film about two cowboys who had a secret romantic relationship . the role earned ledger a best actor oscar nomination . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's brian vitagliano contributed to this report .

'' the clashes began when authorities used force to clear freedom square of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days , according to a u.s. embassy official . ghazarian said the authorities `` moved in '' because `` they thought that there were arms there , and it turned out that they were right . '' watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition '' the embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in freedom square grew to as many as 60,000 armenians at times over the last 10 days . as of early sunday morning , freedom square was empty , ghazarian said , but the protesters were demonstrating in a main square elsewhere in the city . watch ghazarian discuss the situation in armenia '' `` what is happening on the streets of yerevan is people protesting what they consider to be unfair elections , '' ghazarian said . `` after the president was forced to declare a state of emergency , things have quieted down . there are a couple of burning cars , and there are a few hurt people , '' she said . `` we 're convinced that this will come to an end soon . '' she did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries . witnesses told cnn that saturday morning 's action by armenian riot police was bloody , but the u.s. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries . an armenian woman interviewed by cnn said there was `` huge chaos '' when police moved in . `` these are innocent people , '' she said . `` they just want their freedom . they just want to be heard . they are being beaten up , some people have horrible wounds . '' she asked that cnn not use her name because she feared for her safety . as night fell saturday , the sounds of gunfire could be heard from the direction of the protesters ' gathering , and tracer fire could be seen in the sky , according to another yerevan resident , who also asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety . the man said his wife saw two demonstrators hit by a police car earlier in the day . the car initially did not stop , he said , but the protesters surrounded the car , dragged the officers out and burned the vehicle , he said . the officers were able to escape , he said , but he did not know the condition of the protesters who were struck . the protests began soon after the february 19 presidential election . opposition presidential candidate levon ter-petrosian lost to prime minister serzh sarkisian , a political ally of outgoing president kocharian . the opposition party immediately accused the government of vote fraud and demanded that the results be voided . ghazarian said sunday that the government had reached out to the opposition . `` we are hoping with the help of the international community , the opposition , the leader of the opposition , will come and enter a political dialogue rather than continuing this debate on the streets , '' she said . haroutiun khachatrian , editor of the noyan tappan news agency , told cnn that riot police arrested several hundred people in the square saturday morning , including many opposition party officials . ter-petrosian was there but was not arrested , he said . the opposition vowed to pursue its claims through legal means . the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- monitored last month 's armenian election and concluded that it was mostly in line with international standards , although it did include some criticism in its report . the u.s. embassy has warned the several hundred americans living in yerevan to stay at home and avoid the downtown area where the demonstrations have been taking place , the u.s. official said . armenia , population 3 million , is a former soviet republic east of turkey , south of georgia and north of iran . e-mail to a friend .

625	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the top military and civilian leaders of the u.s. air force were forced out thursday over the handling of nuclear weapons , the defense department secretary said . air force chief of staff gen. michael moseley , left , and secretary michael wynne have stepped down . chief of staff gen. t. michael moseley and secretary michael w. wynne resigned over the department 's concern over two incidents , including the august flight of a b-52 bomber that flew across the country with nuclear weapons . `` focus of the air force leadership has drifted '' in terms of handling nuclear weapons and equipment , defense secretary robert gates said . in august , a b-52 bomber flew from north dakota to louisiana with the crew unaware that six nuclear-tipped missiles were on board . four officers were relieved of duty afterward , including three colonels . gates also cited this year 's discovery that components designed to arm and fuse nuclear warheads were accidentally shipped to taiwan in 2006 . watch gates talk about the firings '' critics also cite last month 's news that the air force 's 5th bomb wing failed a defense `` nuclear surety '' inspection -- despite having months to prepare and being under close scrutiny after the previous incidents . the inspection found deficiencies in the wing 's ability to protect its part of the nation 's nuclear stockpile . the resignations come after a report on a navy admiral 's investigation that criticized the air force 's reactions to the incidents . gates said the report `` depicts a pattern of poor performance '' in which air force brass did n't act to improve security after mishaps and air force personnel handling nuclear weapons consistently failed to follow existing rules . air force leaders `` not only fell short in terms of specific acts , they failed to recognize systemic problems , to address those problems or , when beyond their authority to act , to call the attention of superiors to those problems , '' gates said . the investigation found that although the taiwan incident did n't compromise the integrity of the u.s. nuclear force , it represented `` a significant failure '' by the air force to ensure sensitive military components , gates said . gates said the report concluded that erosion in the branch 's command and oversight standards helped lead to the incidents , and that they could have been prevented if the oversight programs had functioned correctly . he said he asked for the resignations after consulting president bush . sen. carl levin , the democratic chairman of the senate armed service committee , welcomed gates ' decision . `` secretary gates ' focus on accountability is essential and had been absent from the office of the secretary of defense for too long , '' levin said . `` the safety and security of america 's nuclear weapons must receive the highest priority , just as it must in other countries . '' rep. edward j. markey , a massachusetts democrat and a senior member of the house homeland security committee , also welcomed the resignations . markey said he 's long been concerned about what he called a series of dangerous air force missteps in handling nuclear weapons . `` the magnitude and frequency of these errors indicate a deep-seated problem within air force culture , practice and training , '' markey said . `` the entire department of defense should immediately recommit itself to ensuring the safety and security of our nuclear stockpile before one of these mistakes has lethal consequences . '' a senior military source said the august nuclear weapons incident was the straw that broke the camel 's back but that other leadership issues also factored into moseley 's and wynne 's resignations . a previous investigation into the b-52 flight uncovered a `` lackadaisical '' attention to detail in day-to-day operations at the air bases involved , an air force official said in october . maj. gen. dick newton , assistant deputy chief of staff for operations , said the investigation found `` a failure to follow procedures '' by `` a limited number of airmen '' at the two bases . newton defended the procedures themselves . wynne is not the first secretary of a military branch to resign since gates became defense secretary . in march 2007 , gates announced the resignation of army secretary francis j. harvey in the wake of reports of substandard conditions at walter reed army medical center in washington . cnn 's jamie mcintyre and barbara starr contributed to this report .
626	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a woman who helped raise a child with her female partner in vermont before the pair split can visit the girl in virginia even though that state does n't recognize same-sex unions , a court ruled friday . janet jenkins with isabella , the daughter she helped raise with former partner lisa miller . virginia 's supreme court ruled that janet jenkins and lisa miller 's civil union in 2000 gave vermont , and its law on same-sex unions , jurisdiction over their subsequent custody and visitation disputes . miller moved to virginia with the child in 2003 , and a vermont court granted jenkins visitation rights . but miller took the case to a virginia court , which ruled that jenkins had no such rights there . the case was considered by legal experts to be the first conflict between two state courts over a major legal question arising from same-sex unions . jenkins ' attorney , joseph price of the washington law firm arent fox , said friday 's ruling `` just affirms the old principle that when these kinds of custody and visitation disputes begin in one state , that 's where they should remain . '' `` you ca n't shop them around to another state , '' price said . `` virginia really had no choice but to enforce judgments and judicial orders from vermont . '' vermont is one of the few states that allow same-sex partners to enter into a civil union . two years after vermont recognized miller and jenkins ' relationship , miller gave birth to a daughter , isabella , conceived through artificial insemination . the relationship deteriorated , and miller and the baby moved to virginia . a vermont court later granted miller a dissolution of the civil union and granted custody of the child to her and visitation rights to jenkins . miller then asked the courts in virginia -- which does not recognize same-sex unions or marriages -- to take jurisdiction of the dispute . a virginia state judge eventually ruled that jenkins had no `` parentage or visitation rights . '' the virginia high court ruling friday returned the case to vermont 's control , meaning jenkins can visit the girl , who is now 6 . miller 's attorney , mathew staver , said he was `` disappointed the state sidestepped the larger legal questions . '' `` this case shows that one state is not an island in the same-sex marriage dispute , and underscores having state laws that protect traditional one-man , one-woman marriages , '' said staver , chairman of liberty counsel , a law firm that fights on behalf of what it calls `` traditional families . '' miller said in 2005 that she was doing what was best for her daughter and was no longer a lesbian . `` i am isabella 's mom . i did conceive her ; i birthed her , '' she said . `` i 'm raising her . and in my opinion , isabella needs to stay with me 100 percent of the time , because i am the only person that she identifies as a mom .

628	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- english football fans hoping to travel to moscow for this month 's champions league final between manchester united and chelsea face spiraling costs and an anxious wait for visas amid a simmering diplomatic row between the uk and russia . chelsea fans hoping to follow their side to moscow face hefty expenses and an anxious wait over visas . upwards of 50,000 fans are expected to travel to the may 21 match from the uk , defying expensive flights and warnings about a shortage of accommodation in the russian capital -- one of the world 's most expensive cities . but there were fears on thursday that russia 's stringent visa requirements for british citizens could further complicate matters for fans . in a statement , the russian embassy in london pledged to fulfil its obligations to enable all fans with tickets to the game to travel . but it also criticized the uk government for tightening restrictions on russians traveling in the opposite direction , imposed following the apparent murder of the exiled russian dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 . `` if we had an agreement similar to the one russia has in place with eu , most problems could have been avoided , '' the statement said . the embassy also criticized the uk for imposing `` cumbersome '' visa requirements on supporters of the russian side , zenit st. petersburg , which could reach the uefa cup final in manchester on may 14 , including biometric tests , online-only applications and interviews with consulate officials . but there was speculation as well on thursday that moscow may be prepared to temporarily lift some visa requirements in a gesture of good will . the uk 's times newspaper quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying that russian authorities would waive the need for visa applicants to produce a letter of invitation in the case of ticket holders . uefa communications director william gaillard praised russia 's flexibility on wednesday and said a simplified visa application procedure could be in place by the end of the week . `` the russians have shown great flexibility and hopefully within the next 48 hours we will be announcing a more simplified procedure for visas to make it easier for fans to get to moscow , '' gaillard told the uk 's press association . manchester united chief executive david gill said on wednesday that those traveling on official club packages were assured of a visa . `` if you are on an organized trip , your ticket will be your visa . the actual specifics and fine details will be addressed in the next day or so and then we will communicate with the fans . `` everyone recognizes in order for it to be a showcase , which it clearly will be , you have to ease entry into the country while not totally doing away with what the russian authorities require . '' but gill warned that demand for tickets would leave many fans disappointed : `` we could sell well over 100,000 tickets for this final , so there will be a lot of disappointed people . '' both united and chelsea have each received around 21,000 tickets for the match . but with officially allocated tickets expected to be snapped up by season ticket holders and loyalty scheme members , many more fans are expected to travel to moscow independently . flights from london to moscow on the day of the match , returning the following day were available for around $ 1,600 over the internet on thursday . but the british foreign office web site advised thursday that there were no hotel vacancies in moscow and warned supporters that they would not be able to find a room on arrival . meanwhile , uk sports minister gerry sutcliffe urged fans to be on their best behavior in moscow , warning that trouble could derail england 's bid to host the 2018 world cup . `` i was really impressed and pleased that the european champions final will be an all-english final but that brings some responsibilities for the teams involved and their supporters , '' sutcliffe told pa. . `` it should be a great advert for the premier league and for english football but it will also be the place everyone will be looking at if anything goes wrong . `` if that happened it would not only be damaging for the two teams participating but could also have a big impact on the reputation of our game at a time when we are trying to encourage football nations to support our world cup bid . '' with the match due to kick off at 2245 local time , the british foreign office web site advised supporters `` not to let alcohol spoil their champions league final experience , '' pointing out that smoking and drinking in red square are illegal . `` the foreign and commonwealth office is providing detailed information for those fans who are traveling , '' said minister for europe jim murphy . `` so i encourage those who are going , to look at the specific travel advice on how to enjoy a trouble-free and successful visit to moscow .

629	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the transportation security administration said friday its officers at a texas airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings -- one with pliers -- but acknowledged the procedures should be changed . the woman involved -- mandi hamlin -- told reporters earlier friday she was humiliated by last month 's incident , in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male tsa officers nearby . the incident occurred at the lubbock , texas , airport . the officers `` rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved , '' the tsa said in a statement posted on its web site friday afternoon . `` tsa supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing lubbock that day . '' however , `` tsa has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed , '' the statement said . `` in the future , tsa will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question . '' hamlin and her lawyer , celebrity attorney gloria allred , said they want a public apology from the agency , as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect . allred pointed out that tsa 's web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said hamlin was never offered . `` the conduct of tsa was cruel and unnecessary , '' allred told reporters at a news conference . `` last time that i checked , a nipple was not a dangerous weapon . '' she said if an apology was not forthcoming , `` mandi is going to have to consider her legal options . '' attempts by cnn to reach allred for a response to the tsa statement friday afternoon were unsuccessful . tsa said in its statement it acknowledges `` that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets -lrb- the -rrb- situation in which she found herself . we appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again . '' the incident occurred february 24 as hamlin , 37 , was preparing to fly to dallas-fort worth from lubbock , where she had been visiting her elderly great-uncle . hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport . she did not set off the metal detector at lubbock international airport , but was pulled to the side for additional screening , allred said . a hand wand used by a tsa officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts . hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings , allred said , and that officer called over another officer , who told her she would need to remove them . `` ms. hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings , '' allred said , reading from a letter she sent tsa . `` after nipple rings are inserted , the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove . in addition , once removed , the pierced skin may close up almost immediately , making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing . '' more officers were called over , and the group grew to four male and two female tsa officers , according to hamlin . also , a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather . the officers insisted that hamlin remove the nipple rings , allred said . `` she felt humiliated by the scene that the tsa officers were making , '' allred said . `` with tears streaming down her face , she again asked to show the piercings to a tsa officer instead of having to remove them . she was told , however , she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them . had she been told that she had a right to a pat-down , she would have chosen that option . '' she eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings , allred said . one came out easily , but the other would not , and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers . she was handed a large pair , allred said . `` as ms. hamlin struggled to remove the piercing , behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male tsa officers snickering in the background , '' allred said in the letter . `` mandi hamlin was publicly humiliated . ... clearly , this is not how passengers should be treated . '' watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry '' afterward , hamlin underwent another scan , but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring . she offered to remove it , allred said , but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it . hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed , allred said . `` i would n't wish this experience upon anyone , '' hamlin told reporters . `` i felt surprised , embarrassed , humiliated and scared . no one deserves to go through this . '' in a statement earlier friday , the tsa said it `` is well aware of terrorists ' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body . therefore , we have a duty to the american public to resolve any alarm that we discover . '' tsa included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a `` bra bomb '' in training and testing its officers . hamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted , and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed . `` people who are pierced should not be snickered at , should not become the object of ridicule , should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment , '' allred said . `` they should be respected just like everybody else . '' she said she had received a call from tsa 's public affairs office friday morning . `` we hope that means they 're going to jump on this and do something about it , '' she said . `` we want tsa to do the right thing now . we 're going to give them the opportunity . '' hamlin said she will continue to fly but will avoid the lubbock airport . the next time she visits her great-uncle , she said , `` i will be driving .

630	new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- an indian woman accused of being a witch was tied to a tree and beaten by a mob , with television footage of the incident aired in india on friday . villagers tied the woman to a tree after a man accused her of practicing black magic . nishant tiwari , a police official in northeastern india , said a journalist who filmed the beating called him thursday to report the incident , which took place in the village of dumaria in central eastern bihar state . he arrived to find the woman tied to a tree , her hair partially cut and her complexion ruddy from being slapped . she had no serious injuries . `` i was appalled at what i saw because people should be more socially responsible than to do this , '' tiwari said . authorities arrested six people , including the man who admitted to hiring her services as a witch . they were due to appear before a magistrate on friday . ram ayodhya , who could face up to seven years in prison for his role in the attack , told police he was justified in beating the woman , tiwari said . graphic content warning : villagers beat woman '' ayodhya said he paid her to use magic and prayer to improve his wife 's health . when his wife 's condition deteriorated , ayodhya accused her of performing black magic , tiwari said , and a crowd soon gathered and tied her to the tree . the woman seen being attacked is expected to testify when the suspects appear before the magistrate . tiwari said he was disturbed by the fact that a journalist filmed the incident before contacting authorities . `` the media filmed the incident , then called the police -- instead of the police first , '' tiwari said . cnn 's partner network , cnn-ibn , reported that the incident took place close to the local police station . it reported that there had been other such occurrences of mob justice in the state . in bhagalpur district in august 2007 , a man caught trying to snatch a woman 's chain was beaten up , with police looking on , and later tied to a motorcycle and dragged around by a police officer . in september , in lucknow 's wazirganj area , an angry mob beat a man to death after a 2 1/2 - year old girl was allegedly found sexually assaulted and murdered in his house . e-mail to a friend .
631	baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- court proceedings in the trial against tariq aziz , one of the best-known faces of saddam hussein 's former regime in iraq , and several co-defendants have ended after being in session only briefly tuesday . the trial of tariq aziz , pictured here in a baghdad courtroom in july 2004 , has begun . the trial , which is to resume may 20 , was delayed because one of the defendants , ali hassan al-majeed , also known as `` chemical ali , '' was not present because he was ill . iraqi procedural codes require that all defendants be in court for the first session . chief judge raouf abdul rahman read a u.s. medical report signed by three doctors that said al-majeed is in critical condition after suffering a heart attack two weeks ago . he has been released from the hospital but still requires daily treatment and doctor visits . the report said that traveling to court from his detention facility could worsen his health . he can not walk up stairs or sit in court for long hours , it said . he will need three weeks to recover and may need some sort of surgery , the report said . it added he is diabetic and suffers from `` acute heart failure . '' treatment includes clearing of the arteries followed by either open heart surgery or stents in the arteries , but neither option is available at this time , the report said . ali hasan al-majeed , who was a top baathist official during the saddam hussein era , is awaiting execution after being convicted of genocide in connection with the killing of kurds during the anfal campaign in the late 1980s . aziz , al-majeed and six others are now facing trial for having a role in the execution of 42 iraqi merchants in 1992 . a former deputy prime minister , aziz was the first to be called into court , followed by six other defendants . aziz appeared frail , walked slowly with a cane , and was coughing and blowing his nose . he was sitting in the seat saddam hussein used during his appearances in court and was represented by a private attorney . the court was sorting out which defendants did not have attorneys present . this is the fourth major trial of former hussein regime officials since his government was overthrown . the most prominent was the 2006 trial that led to the execution of hussein and three lieutenants for a crackdown in the shiite town of dujail in which more than 140 men allegedly plotting hussein 's assassination were executed . aziz 's lead attorney , badie aref -- who was an attorney for hussein in that trial -- is charged with contempt of court in iraq and has been in jordan since a warrant for his arrest was issued last year . he said he would return to baghdad for this trial only if he were assured he would not be arrested . meanwhile , amid a swirling , blanketing sandstorm , fierce fighting in baghdad tuesday saw u.s. troops kill 32 `` enemy forces '' in a gunbattle , according to the u.s. military . iraqi authorities reported 16 people were killed in a residential area in the same clash . the iraqi interior ministry said the fighting was in the predominantly shiite sadr city neighborhood in eastern baghdad . five suspected insurgents dressed in iraqi army uniforms attacked the home of a human rights worker in diyala on tuesday , killing the resident of the home and an iraqi soldier who lived in the neighborhood , according to the u.s. military . two iraqi civilians also were injured in the small-arms attack . `` attacking civilians in their homes is both criminal and barbaric , '' said major peggy kageleiry , spokeswoman for the military 's multi-national division - north . insurgents have been attempting to exploit the harsh conditions , which have curtailed flights coming into baghdad international airport . sandstorms make it easier for militants to screen their activities and harder for u.s. air power to be deployed effectively . a u.s. military spokesman said fighting began around 9:30 a.m. when militants fired at a u.s. patrol and wounded an american soldier . when the soldier was being evacuated , a u.s. vehicle was struck by two roadside bombs and peppered with small-arms fire and rocket propelled grenades . that left two more soldiers injured . three more soldiers were wounded in the fighting . soldiers used a `` combination of weapon systems available , including a guided multiple launch rocket -lrb- gmlr -rrb- system '' to fight the insurgents and killed at least 28 militants in a four-hour long battle , the military said . lt. col. steven stover , spokesman for multi-national division-baghdad , said three gmlrs were launched , at 11:23 a.m. , 1:03 p.m. and 1:37 p.m. officials with iraq 's interior and health ministry told cnn 16 people were killed and 45 people were wounded when u.s. rockets hit at least three houses in a residential area in sadr city around 1:15 p.m. two children and a woman were among the dead and four children and five women were among the wounded , they said . asked if he was aware of reports of civilian casualties from the strikes , stover said , `` if there were civilian casualties , i sincerely regret them . `` the rockets struck militants firing from buildings , alleyways and rooftops . it was these militants who initiated the engagement by attacking u.s. soldiers . our soldiers have a right to defend ourselves . '' two u.s. soldiers were killed tuesday in separate incidents in northwest baghdad , the military said . the first soldier died from wounds suffered from insurgent small-arms fire at about 8:50 p.m. local time in northwest baghdad , according to a u.s. military public affairs office . the second soldier died at about 10:15 p.m. when the vehicle he was riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device . the names of both soldiers were being withheld until their families could be notified . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's jomana karadsheh , christine theodorou , mohammed tawfeeq and ingrid formanek contributed to this report .
632	belgrade , serbia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. embassy in belgrade is evacuating all nonessential personnel following thursday 's attack on the building by a crowd of protesters , a spokesman for the embassy told cnn friday . serbian riot police stand in front of the damaged u.s. embassy in belgrade on friday . the u.s. ambassador , cameron munter , is staying , officials said . the embassy was closed friday , and a handful of riot police holding shields stood outside the building , its outer walls blackened from fires set the night before and some of its windows smashed . it will remain closed until monday or tuesday so officials can assess the damage , said bill wanlund , the embassy 's spokesman . he said embassy staff were still in a heightened state of alert but there were no specific threats against any staff members . the united states has warned the serbian government that it has a responsibility to protect its assets . a top u.s. diplomat was asked during an interview on cnn if the serbian government `` gets '' the warning . `` they 'd better get it , because they have a fundamental responsibility to protect our diplomats and our embassy and to protect american citizens , '' said undersecretary of state for political affairs r. nicholas burns . `` what happened yesterday in belgrade was absolutely reprehensible . '' watch burns ' angry comments on belgrade attack '' thursday 's violence erupted after demonstrations by thousands of serbs against kosovo 's declaration of independence . the anger directed against the united states and other countries for recognizing the breakaway province as a nation sparked attacks on western embassies and shops by hundreds of people . burns said there was an `` insufficient '' number of security people guarding the u.s. embassy at a demonstration everyone knew would take place . he said security `` melted away '' as `` the mob attacked our embassy . '' `` this kind of thing should not happen in a civilized country . it does n't happen in the united states of america . it does n't happen in most world capitals . so the serb government needs to reflect seriously about the responsibility it has under the vienna convention , '' he said . burns , the third highest ranking diplomat in the state department , said he told the serbian prime minister , vojislav kostunica , and his government that the u.s. `` would hold them personally responsible for the safety of our people . '' `` they assured me that they would have adequate security on the ground today and for every day to come . we will hold them to that commitment , '' burns said . demonstrators only managed to break into one u.s. embassy building , which wanlund said was rarely used by staff . he said the protesters did n't manage to get any documents or embassy materials . only marines and security guards were present at the embassy when the angry mob of about 100 approached the walls . in addition to the u.s. embassy , the protesters attacked other western interests including the embassies of britain and germany , as well as a mcdonald 's restaurant and a nike shop . `` one might understand the emotion , but not the violence , and that 's what the serb government needs to remember , '' burns said . burns , who is stepping down in march , has long been involved in trying to resolve tensions in the former yugoslavia . the situation was complicated by sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence by serbia 's predominantly albanian region of kosovo . kosovo is revered historically by orthodox christian serbs but also is claimed as separate and distinct by its ethnic muslim albanians . the wisdom of recognizing kosovo independence has been questioned by many observers , who say the united states wo n't recognize other unilateral declarations of independence . some opponents of kosovo 's independence say recognition is a bad precedent if it 's unilateral and not done in a bilateral , diplomatic setting . they say it will give others the incentive to stage their own breakaway nations . burns said every situation has its unique set of circumstances , as does kosovo , which was the victim of ethnic cleansing policies by the slobodan milosevic regime in 1999 . nato troops fought serbia in an air war then and pushed serbian forces out of the region . since then kosovo has been run by the united nations and with security supplied by nato forces . e-mail to a friend .
633	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- author arthur c. clarke , whose science fiction and non-fiction works ranged from the script for `` 2001 : a space odyssey '' to an early proposal for communications satellites , has died at age 90 , associates have said . visionary author arthur c. clarke had fans around the world . clarke had been wheelchair-bound for several years with complications stemming from a youthful bout with polio and had suffered from back trouble recently , said scott chase , the secretary of the nonprofit arthur c. clarke foundation . he died early wednesday -- tuesday afternoon et -- at a hospital in colombo , sri lanka , where he had lived since the 1950s , chase said . `` he had been taken to hospital in what we had hoped was one of the slings and arrows of being 90 , but in this case it was his final visit , '' he said . in a videotaped 90th birthday message to fans , clarke said he still hoped to see some sign of intelligent life beyond earth , more work on alternatives to fossil fuels -- and `` closer to home , '' an end to the 25-year civil war in sri lanka between the government and ethnic tamil separatists . `` i dearly wish to see lasting peace established in sri lanka as soon as possible , '' he said . `` but i 'm aware that peace can not just be wished -- it requires a great deal of hard work , courage and persistence . '' clarke and director stanley kubrick shared an academy award nomination for best adapted screenplay for `` 2001 . '' the film grew out of clarke 's 1951 short story , `` the sentinel , '' about an alien transmitter left on the moon that ceases broadcasting when humans arrive . as a royal air force officer during world war ii , clarke took part in the early development of radar . in a paper written for the radio journal `` wireless world '' in 1945 , he suggested that artificial satellites hovering in a fixed spot above earth could be used to relay telecommunications signals across the globe . he is widely credited with introducing the idea of the communications satellite , the first of which were launched in the early 1960s . but he never patented the idea , prompting a 1965 essay that he subtitled , `` how i lost a billion dollars in my spare time . '' his best-known works , such as `` 2001 '' or the 1953 novel `` childhood 's end , '' combined the hard science he learned studying physics and mathematics with insights into how future discoveries would change humanity . david eicher , editor of astronomy magazine , told cnn that clarke 's writings were influential in shaping public interest in space exploration during the 1950s and '60s . watch how clarke stands among sci-fi giants '' `` he was very interested in technology and also in humanity 's history and what lay out in the cosmos , '' eicher said . his works combined those `` big-picture '' themes with `` compelling stories that were more interesting and more complex than other science fiction writers were doing , '' he said . tedson meyers , the chairman of the clarke foundation , said the organization is now dedicated to reproducing the combination of imagination and knowledge that he credited the author with inspiring . `` the question for us is , how does human imagination bring about such talent on both sides of the brain ? '' he asked . `` how do you find the next arthur clarke ? '' clarke was knighted in 1998 . he wrote dozens of novels and collections of short stories and more than 30 nonfiction works during his career , and served as a television commentator during several of the apollo moon missions . though humans have not returned to the moon since 1972 , clarke said he was confident that a `` golden age '' of space travel was just beginning . watch clarke talk about sci-fi vs. reality '' `` after half a century of government-sponsored efforts , we are now witnessing the emergence of commercial space flight , '' he said in his december birthday message . `` over the next 50 years , thousands of people will travel to earth orbit -- and then , to the moon and beyond . space travel and space tourism will one day become almost as commonplace as flying to exotic destinations on our own planet .

635	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- austrian investigators monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where josef fritzl kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years , along with three of their children . josef fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children . investigators believe fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978 , shortly after , according to his daughter , he began raping her at age 11 or 12 , said police spokesman franz polzer . the 73-year-old austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year , and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- polzer said . it took fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition , polzer said . investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison , which was blocked by a 500-kilogram -lrb- 1,100-pound -rrb- steel and concrete door that fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance , polzer said . fritzl , who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar , had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison . `` you would have to open up a total of eight doors , and ... -lrb- for the -rrb- last door which would go into this space -lrb- where the family was imprisoned -rrb- , you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus , '' polzer said . `` we will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we have n't discovered yet , and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting . '' fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter , elisabeth , captive in the dungeon under the fritzl home for decades , repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived . three of the children were adopted by josef fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep . the story of the family 's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago , when one of the children still in the dungeon , 19-year-old kerstin fritzl , fell seriously ill with convulsions . the father agreed to take her to a hospital , the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers . dr. albert reiter , who is treating kerstin , said monday that while her condition is still `` grave , '' it `` has improved somewhat . '' `` she has become more stable , but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help , '' reiter said , noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation . elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother , rosemarie , who police say knew nothing about the basement prison . they were also reunited with the three children that josef had taken from elisabeth . the reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic , where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic 's chief doctor . `` the mother and the smallest child have , in just the last couple of days , increased their sensitivity to light , '' dr. berthold kepplinger said . `` so we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses . '' five-year-old felix is `` getting more and more lively , '' kepplinger said . `` he 's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air , the light , and the food -- all of these things are helping them , '' he said . `` slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal -lrb- shade -rrb- . '' he also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family . kepplinger praised elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity . he said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family , and the children make their beds . however , he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in fritzl 's home . he said the mother , elisabeth , takes breaks and naps several times a day . the health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying , kepplinger said . kepplinger said the children , after being confined to a small space their entire lives , are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces . initially the dungeon where fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters . in 1993 , around the time elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child , fritzl decided to add to the dungeon , building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters . on wednesday or thursday , prosecution authorities will attempt to question fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession , state prosecutor gerhard sedlacek said . a warden at the st. poelten jail , where fritzl is being held , told cnn that fritzl appears to be doing well , but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained . e-mail to a friend .
636	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- croatia held off a furious late onslaught from euro 2008 co-hosts austria to win 1-0 in their opening group b match in vienna on sunday . emmanuel pogagtetz , left , fouls croatia striker ivica olic to concede the match-winning penalty . the croatians took the lead in the fourth minute when midfielder luka modric coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after emmanuel pogatetz clumsily body-checked striker ivica olic in the area . slaven bilic 's team dominated the first half , and should have gone further ahead in the 35th minute but olic 's strike partner mladen petric blazed over the bar with a left-foot volley after beating the offside trap to run on to vedran corluka 's cross . austria 's main threat had come from set-pieces , but they were not able to capitalize on a string of corners . however , the home players kept battling in the second half and squandered a series of chances to level the score in the final 15 minutes . martin harnik fired over the bar on 78 as croatia scrambled to clear the danger , then substitute ivica vastic had a powerful header well saved by goalkeeper stipe pletikosa , who then kept out another low effort by the veteran midfielder . pletikosa also had to deny a driven shot from umit korkmaz , who also came off the bench , while another substitute in roman kienast flicked a header just wide from a free kick in the third minute of time added on . croatia went into the tournament as one of the outside bets , having qualified top of their group ahead of russia with a victory away to england which eliminated the british team . however , their chances of success were dealt a massive blow when top scorer eduardo da silva was ruled out of the tournament due to a broken leg . none of croatia 's strikers managed to score in the warmup matches , and the arsenal forward 's goal-poaching ability was sorely missed on sunday . the winning goal came after modric and olic combined down the left wing from a throw-in , and pogatetz clearly impeded the striker well away from the austria goal . the middlesbrough defender was booked for protesting the referee 's decision , but he could have no complaints with the ruling . austria are the lowest-ranked of the 16 teams at the tournament in 92nd place , but showed great courage against a 15th-seeded croatia side stacked with attacking talent . but they joined fellow co-hosts switzerland in losing their opening match , following the czech republic 's 1-0 victory on saturday . croatia next play germany on thursday , when austria take on poland . coach bilic was delighted to start with a victory , but was not so impressed with his team 's performance . `` some players were overwhelmed by playing at a great tournament but we started off with the best possible way -- with a win , '' bilic told reporters . `` in the first 35 minutes we played excellently , of course the early lead contributed to that . `` they exerted more pressure in the second half and i 'm sure that is not to do with a lack of strength from our players . but we confined ourselves to our penalty area too early . `` the last 15 minutes or so when they play all or nothing , you can do that -- but we started in the 60th minute or so . i did n't think the players were happy when they got back in the dressing room . i turned on the cd player and said they should sing because they won . '' austria coach josef hickersberger was left frustrated by his side 's failure to take their chances . `` this was the worst possible start you can have in an opening match of a major tournament , '' he said . `` we took some time to recover , during the first 30 minutes we were nervous . `` for the rest of the match we were playing the way we should have been playing . we even dominated in the second half of the match . we had good opportunities but unfortunately we were n't able to score a goal , so we are empty-handed . in our remaining games we need four points to go through .

638	editor 's note : `` glenn beck '' is on headline news nightly at 7 and 9 et . glenn beck says to always question conventional wisdom . new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- `` the people who survived the great depression were the ones who had money to buy when everybody else was selling . '' -- my grandfather . i learned a lot from my grandfather , but that might have been the greatest lesson he ever taught me . he was n't just talking about managing money , he was talking about managing life -- and his words have stuck with me since i was a child . a few years back , i was taking a theology course and the professor recommended only the books whose authors he agreed with . i read those books , but i also asked that professor which books he thought had it completely wrong -- and i read those too . then i made up my own mind . after all , following the herd is fine until they all run off the side of a cliff together . less than a year ago , a recession was the last thing on anyone 's mind . in fact , over the summer , as i was questioning the conventional wisdom , i read an article on my television show that quoted a financial expert as saying , `` it is the strongest global market that we 've seen in the history of measuring these things . '' that 's when i realized how fast the herd was approaching the cliff . but with predictions of a recession now more common than fed rate cuts -- and that 's saying something -- maybe now it 's time to look at a worst-case scenario . after all , considering all sides of an issue , no matter how extreme they may be , does n't make you a crazy person ; it makes you an educated one . so to understand what a real meltdown could look like , i turned to nouriel roubini , chairman of rge monitor and professor of economics at new york university 's stern school of business . he 's also a former adviser to the u.s. treasury department . professor roubini recently laid out what he called the `` 12 steps to financial disaster . '' unfortunately , they were really complicated , and i have severe add , so i 've boiled them down into five phases that even a rodeo clown like me can understand . i think of these like our military 's `` defcon '' -- or defense readiness condition -- scale , except that this countdown could end in the meltdown of your bank account : . • defconomy five . how you 'll know we 're here : the housing downturn turns into a free fall , making it the worst collapse in our country 's history . that not only triggers massive numbers of foreclosures and lost household wealth , but it also sets off another large wave of bank write-downs . odds we get here : roubini told me that it 's `` extremely likely , even unavoidable '' that we hit this stage because `` the excess supply of new homes in the market is like we 've never seen before . '' prices , he believes , `` need to fall another 10 to 20 percent before that clears . '' • defconomy four . how you 'll know we 're here : americans upside-down on their mortgages and unable to pay their home equity loans begin defaulting on other debt , like credit cards , car loans and student loans . in addition , bond insurance companies lose their perfect credit ratings , forcing already troubled banks to write down another $ 150 billion . odds we get here : high . roubini says that 8 million households are already upside-down on their mortgages and he thinks we could see that number go to between 16 million and 24 million by the end of 2009 . a lot of those people , he believes , will simply walk away from their homes and send their keys back to the bank . • defconomy three . how you 'll know we 're here : some banks begin to crack under the pressure of continuing write-downs and mounting defaults by consumers . a national or large regional bank finally collapses , triggering hedge fund failures and general chaos on wall street , potentially leading to a 1987-style market crash . odds we get here : very good . roubini says that we 'll likely socialize the losses , `` effectively nationalizing the mortgages or the banks . '' it would be , he told me , `` like northern rock -lrb- the large bank in england that was recently taken over by the british government -rrb- times three . '' he thinks the stock market will head south throughout the year as fears about a severe recession are confirmed . • defconomy two . how you 'll know we 're here : most forms of credit -lrb- both to consumers and businesses -rrb- become virtually nonexistent . that results in a `` vicious circle '' of additional write-downs , stock market losses , and bank collapses , which leads to even less credit being available . odds we get here : good . roubini says that credit conditions are becoming worse everyday across a variety of markets and wo n't be getting better anytime soon . without extra credit available , people might have to actually -lrb- gasp ! -rrb- live within their means . • defconomy one . how you 'll know we 're here : welcome back to 1929 . a full economic meltdown results in a complete failure of the underlying financial system . what will be known to future generations as `` the greater depression '' has arrived . odds we get here : not likely . roubini believes that this will be a `` very painful and severe recession '' that could last for 18 months or more , but it will be more like 1981 than 1929 . families may be eating soup again , but at least it 'll be in their own kitchens . now , do i think any of what you just read will happen ? i have no idea , and that 's exactly the problem . i 'm not an economist or a stockbroker ; i 'm just a guy trying to make the best decisions i can , and picking the brains of real experts helps me do that . but i do know one thing for sure : depressions are n't advertised in advance . last time around we went from the roaring '20s to bread lines in a matter of just a few years . anyone who says that ca n't happen again either does n't know history , does n't understand how interconnected the world 's economies have become , or is lying to you . while that does n't mean you should panic , it does mean you should prepare -- something my grandfather would 've done a long time ago . e-mail to a friend .

656	tegucigalpa , honduras -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- he 's no julia child , but honduran president manuel zelaya showed tuesday he can attack a cantaloupe and u.s. government claims in a single motion . president manuel zelaya chews on a slice of honduran melon to demonstrate its safety . `` it 's not in our fruit , '' he said about last week 's report by the u.s. food and drug administration that some honduran cantaloupes may be contaminated with salmonella . `` it 's not true what they are saying . logically , we believe it is an error . '' then , the 55-year-old father of four asked the viewers of cnn en español to indulge him as he engaged in a show-and-tell demonstration . `` permit me a second , '' he said as he stretched his left arm across the tabletop and outside the view of the camera , then pulled into view a box of fruit . `` here i have the box of melons that we are exporting to the united states ; here are the protective bags , '' he said . zelaya lifted a cantaloupe from the box , placed it in front of him , then grabbed a knife and a fork . `` permit me to make a demonstration , '' he said , then cut open the fruit , sliced off a chunk , put it in his mouth and chewed vigorously . `` i eat this fruit without any fear , '' he said with his mouth full . `` it 's a delicious fruit . nothing happens to me ! '' though the symptoms of salmonella infection -- nausea , vomiting , fever , diarrhea and abdominal cramps -- typically do not occur for several hours after eating tainted food , the point was made . the demonstration came three days after the fda said it had linked 50 cases of salmonella in 16 states and nine in canada to melons from agropecuaria montelibana , a grower and packer in san lorenzo , honduras . though there have been no reports of fatalities , 14 people have been hospitalized in arizona , california , colorado , georgia , illinois , missouri , new jersey , new mexico , new york , ohio , oklahoma , oregon , tennessee , utah , washington and wisconsin , the fda said . while the company has continued exporting to europe and central america and has received no reports of illness , the daily export of 45 containers of melon to the united states has halted , a company official said monday . as a result , some 1,500 workers have been laid off , most of them single mothers , and company losses have exceeded $ 3 million , company officials said . the fda alert advised u.s. grocers , food-service operators and produce processors to remove from their stock any cantaloupes from the company . the agency also recommended consumers throw away any cantaloupes determined to be from the company . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's elvin sandoval contributed to this story .
657	jena , louisiana -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- thousands of protesters clogged the tiny town of jena , louisiana , thursday to show their indignation over what they consider unjust , unequal punishments meted out in two racially charged incidents . officers lead al sharpton , center , through jena , louisiana , during thursday 's protest . they swarmed over the grounds of jena high school , where nooses were hung from a tree in early august 2006 , about three months before six black teens known as the `` jena 6 '' were accused of beating a white classmate . while the tension was palpable , news broke thursday afternoon that the 3rd circuit court of appeal ordered a hearing within 72 hours to determine if the only one of the six still behind bars can be released . the order has `` got to be good , '' mychal bell 's attorney , bob noel , told cnn . `` it means we have a day in court . any day in court is going to be a good day . '' earlier , there was an aura of a pilgrimage at the site where the controversial tree once stood before school administrators had it removed . many people touched the ground and some retrieved a lump of dirt , said cnn 's eric marrapodi . he said the part of the town he was in was ill-prepared for the crowds -- no water or toilets were available . in the background , groups shouted `` black power '' and `` no justice , no peace . '' the estimated 15000 to 20,000 demonstrators shut down the town of 3,000 in central louisiana . many residents left for the day , and government agencies , businesses and schools were closed . sgt. tim ledet of the louisiana state police said protesters in buses were still bringing people to town at midday because of the gridlock , but many protesters got off and walked into town on foot . `` there is just no room to maneuver in this small town , '' he said . jena resident terry adams disagreed with any accusations that there might be a black-white divide in the area . `` we are not a racial town . we get along with each other , we get along fine . this is something that got out of proportion . it really has . '' jena 's racial tensions were aggravated in august 2006 , when three white teens hung the nooses the day after a group of black students received permission from school administrators to sit under the tree -- a place where white students normally congregated . the guilty students were briefly suspended from classes , despite the principal 's recommendation they be expelled , according to donald washington , u.s. attorney for the western district of louisiana . a member of the lasalle parish school board -- which had a role in supporting suspension instead of expulsion -- insisted the board is not prejudiced . the panel felt it took the appropriate action , jonny fryar said . `` i talked to one of the parents , who called me and said their son thought it was a prank and naive to the fact of what it meant and he was sorry , '' he said . `` i hate to see people label us as something we are not . because we have black students and white students playing football together . they shake hands , get along . this is an unfortunate incident . we hope that the community can heal . '' although washington acknowledged the fbi and other investigators thought the noose incident bore the markings of a hate crime , a decision was made not to press federal charges because the case did n't meet federal criteria . the students were under 18 and had no prior records , and no group such as a ku klux klan was found to be behind their actions . on december 4 , about three months after the nooses were discovered , six teens , dubbed the jena 6 , were accused of beating classmate justin barker . the six -- mychal bell , robert bailey jr. , carwin jones , bryant purvis , theo shaw and jesse ray beard -- were originally charged with attempted second-degree murder and conspiracy , according to lasalle parish district attorney reed walters . bell , the only one of the six who remains in jail , was to be sentenced thursday after convictions for aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy to do the same , but both charges have been vacated , awaiting further action by the district attorney . charges for bailey , jones and shaw also were reduced to battery and conspiracy when they were arraigned , while purvis still awaits arraignment . the charges for beard , who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime , are unavailable because he 's a juvenile . tina jones , purvis ' mother , condemned walters . `` i hope that the d.a. will wake up and realize that he 's doing the wrong thing , and to release these kids , '' she said . `` it 's not equal . the black people get the harsher extent of the law , whereas white people get a slap on the wrist per se . so it is not equal here . '' jones maintained that her son was not involved in the beating , but watched from a railing , and was not arrested that same day . `` we have a long fight ahead of us , and we 'll keep fighting until justice prevails in jena , '' the mother said . purvis , who accompanied her , was asked how he 's faring . `` i 'm doing pretty good . i hope there is a pretty good outcome of what 's taking place today , '' he said . watch an interview with one of the jena 6 and his mom '' president bush , who was asked about the rally at a news conference , said , `` the events in louisiana have saddened me . i understand the emotions . the justice department and the fbi are monitoring the situation down there . `` all of us in america want there to be fairness when it comes to justice . '' he advised whoever is elected next year to `` reach out to the african-american community . '' hundreds of college students from historically black schools such as howard university in washington traveled to jena , along with civil rights activists such as al sharpton and the rev. jesse jackson , who helped organize the event . martin luther king iii also attended , saying , `` this is about justice for the six young men . '' sharpton called jena the beginning of the 21st century civil rights movement . `` there 's a jena in every state , '' jackson told the crowd in jena on thursday morning . joann scales , who brought her three teenage children on a two-day bus journey from los angeles , california , to jena , made the same point . `` the reason i brought my children is because it could have been one of them '' involved in an incident like the one in jena . `` if this can happen to them -lsb- the jena 6 -rsb- , it can happen to anyone , '' scales said . ondra hathaway was on the bus with scales . `` if this young man -lsb- bell -rsb- was railroaded to do time as an adult , how many more people has that happened to ? '' she said . jackson said on cnn 's `` american morning '' on thursday that the charges against the black youths , their possible jail terms if convicted and their bail amounts are `` excessive . '' punishing the teens with probation would have been sufficient , jackson said . bails for the jena 6 were between $ 70,000 and $ 138,000 , and all but bell have posted bond . bell , 17 , has been in prison since his arrest . the judge has refused to lower his $ 90,000 bail , citing bell 's record , which includes four juvenile offenses -- two simple battery charges among them . bell was 16 at the time of the attack ; 17 is the legal adult age in louisiana . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's susan roesgen , tony harris , kyra philips , eric marrapodi and eliott mclaughlin contributed to this report .
658	phoenix , arizona -- new england 's failure to protect star quarterback tom brady proved the decisive factor as the patriots flunked their chance of a perfect 19-0 season and super bowl glory . brady is sacked by defensive end michael strahan in the third guarter of the super bowl . brady has weaved his magic behind an all but impregnable offensive line all season but not on sunday as he was sacked five times in the 17-14 defeat to the new york giants . `` they have some great pressure schemes , obviously some great pass rushers , '' brady said . `` once we kind of got the idea of what we were doing , i thought we handled it much better , but we did n't get the ball in the end zone enough . '' coming in , brady had been sacked a career-low 24 times this season playing behind a line that produced three pro bowlers in koppen , left tackle matt light and left guard logan mankins . throw in right guard stephen neal and right tackle nick kaczur , and brady played most of his record-breaking season not having to worry much about getting hit by bloodthirsty defenders . `` i like when i do n't get touched , '' brady said earlier in the week . then , disaster struck -- in the form of an all-out , pressure-packed swarming defensive attack by the giants -- in the worst possible setting . it was the first time brady had been sacked as many as five times since the new york jets did it on sept. 21 , 2003 . new england had no answer for the giants ' bulldozing defense . `` if i could tell you , we 'd have it fixed , '' running back kevin faulk said . `` at the same time , they outplayed us . '' they sure did , and left brady wondering what hit him . brady simply had no time to find randy moss and his other targets on a regular basis against the giants . with 19 seconds left in the game and the patriots facing a do-or-die scenario , brady was sacked for the final time when jay alford pulled him down at new england 's 16-yard line . brady was left with nothing to do but try two straight desperation heaves to moss to no avail . `` i think their intensity from the beginning snap to the end of the game was really higher than ours , '' moss said . `` we just could n't meet that intensity . '' with help from their linemen , the patriots set nfl records for points scored and total touchdowns , while brady broke the league mark for td passes and moss set the record for scoring receptions . that high-powered offense was held to a season-low 14 points in the super bowl -- mostly because it could n't get time . `` they played well defensively , '' coach bill belichick said . `` they 've been able to rush . they led the league in sacks , they rushed all year . they are a good defensive football team . they played well .

659	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- al-jazeera broadcast on thursday an audiotape on which a voice identified as osama bin laden declares `` iraq is the perfect base to set up the jihad to liberate palestine . '' terrorist leader osama bin laden spoke on a video released by al qaeda in september . the voice calls for the people of neighboring countries `` to do their best in supporting their mujahedeen brothers in iraq . '' `` my speech to you is about the siege of gaza and the way to liberate it , '' he said . `` the gaza siege is a direct result of annapolis , '' he adds , apparently referring to the site of november 's summit in annapolis , maryland , where israeli and palestinian leadership agreed to work toward a two-state solution . the voice also calls on `` muslims in the neighboring countries '' to support the `` mujahedeen in iraq . '' the broadcast comes a day after another statement attributed to the al qaeda leader condemned european countries for siding with the united states in afghanistan and for allowing the publication of cartoons considered insulting to islam 's prophet , mohammed . `` this is the greater and more serious tragedy , and the reckoning for it will be more severe , '' the speaker in the five-minute audio recording says . the speaker said muslims have not responded by mocking jesus , whom they consider a prophet as well . `` the laws of men which clash with the legislation of allah the most high are null and void , are n't sacred and do n't matter to us , '' he said . the speaker dismissed claims of free speech in his statement , citing european countries ' laws against denying the existence of the holocaust . bin laden also said in his earlier message that `` the crownless king in riyadh '' -- saudi arabia 's king abdullah -- could have prevented the publication of the cartoons `` if it mattered to him . '' `` if there is no check on the freedom of your words , then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions , '' he said . though the voice sounds like bin laden , cnn has not been able to confirm that it is him . however , a radical islamist web site reported earlier wednesday that a statement from bin laden was coming soon . the notice appeared on al-ekhlaas , known for carrying statements and videos from al qaeda and its allies . analysis of previous statements has indicated that bin laden was the speaker , and a u.s. intelligence official said there was no reason to think the recorded voice was not bin laden 's . bin laden , who was behind the terrorist network 's september 11 attacks , has been in hiding since the u.s. assault on afghanistan that followed those strikes . his last public statement was an audio message issued in december , when he urged his followers in iraq to continue battling u.s. troops there . wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq . the latest statement included no date reference beyond the cartoon controversy , which began in late 2005 when a danish newspaper published a dozen cartoons about islam , including one that depicted mohammed wearing a turban resembling a bomb . violent protests erupted in early 2006 after other european newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech . some muslims believe it is forbidden by the quran to show an image of the prophet at all , and others were offended that the cartoon by artist kurt westergaard appeared to depict mohammed as a terrorist . westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror . several newspapers in denmark reprinted the controversial cartoons in february after danish authorities arrested several people who were said to be plotting a `` terror-related assassination '' of the cartoonist . that sparked violent protests in three afghan cities this month , with muslim students burning flags and chanting anti-western statements . the message said the publication of the drawings in question `` came in the framework of a new crusade in which the pope of the vatican has played a large , lengthy role . '' pope benedict is scheduled to visit the united states next month , with scheduled stops at the white house , the united nations and ground zero , where the twin towers stood until al qaeda 's attack . deputy commissioner paul j. browne of the new york city police department said the department `` has been working closely with the united states secret service to provide the highest level of protection possible '' during the pope 's visit to new york . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's octavia nasr and pam benson contributed to this report .

661	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- democratic rivals hillary clinton and barack obama spent their last debate before next week 's super tuesday contests pointing out differences on iraq , health care and the economy -- but without all of the finger-pointing that 's marked their campaigns . sens. barack obama and hillary clinton struck a mostly cordial tone during the debate . the exchange was in sharp contrast to previous debates because of the absence of political sniping , yet was one of the most substantive policy discussions yet in the race for the nomination . on iraq , obama said he 'd be more able to end the war because he opposed it from the beginning . he said clinton 's vote to authorize the use of force there would undermine her efforts to bring it to an end . `` i think it is much easier for us to have the argument when we have a nominee who says , ' i always thought this was a bad idea -- this was a bad strategy , ' '' he said . clinton defended her vote , saying she was told by the white house that it would be used initially to return weapons inspectors to see whether saddam hussein had an active weapons program . see where they stand on iraq . `` i believe strongly that we needed to put inspectors in , '' the new york senator said . `` that was the underlying reason why i at least voted to give president bush the authority , put those inspectors in , let them do their work , figure out what is there and what is n't . '' watch reaction to clinton 's thoughts on iraq '' both obama and clinton said they support ending the war . on health care , obama defended a plan he says would make insurance affordable to everyone who wants it , but not require everyone to buy it . the illinois senator said his proposal would require that all children be covered and allow young people to remain on their parents ' health insurance up to age 25 -- but would not require adults to purchase care . watch candidates discuss their differences '' `` every expert who looks at it says there wo n't be anybody out there who wants health care who will not be able to get it , '' he said . watch the rivals discuss health care '' clinton , who as first lady spearheaded her husband 's ultimately failed health care reform effort in the early '90s , argued that any health plan should offer universal coverage . `` it is so important that as democrats , we carry the banner of universal health care , '' she said . see where the candidates stand on health care . clinton noted her experience pushing her husband 's plan , saying she 's best suited to hammer out the details of a new plan and create `` a coalition that can withstand the insurance and the prescription drug companies . '' the pair praised former north carolina sen. john edwards , who dropped out of the democratic race this week . both are vying for his supporters . see what the candidates had to say , in their own words '' the democratic race remains close going into super tuesday , when more than 20 states -- including california and new york -- will vote . obama won the season-opening iowa caucuses , then finished second to clinton in every contest until last week 's south carolina primary -- which he won with a commanding 55 percent of the vote in a three-way race . clinton scored victories in the new hampshire primary and nevada caucuses . she also was the top vote-getter in florida and michigan , although no democrats campaigned in those states and their delegates to the nominating convention will not count because of a squabble between state and national party leaders over the timing of the primaries . thursday 's debate differed from the last time the two took to a stage together -- at a contentious january 21 debate in south carolina in which the front-runners peppered each other with sharp attacks . in contrast , on thursday the two smiled , laughed at each other 's jokes and repeatedly complimented the other when they agreed . what does the debate 's cordial tone mean ? '' obama got laughs when asked about how he might counter republican charges against `` tax-and-spend liberal democrats . '' `` well , first of all , i do n't think the republicans are going to be in a real strong position to argue fiscal responsibility , when they have added $ 4 trillion or $ 5 trillion worth of national debt . i am happy to have that argument , '' he said . clinton drew cheers when she responded to a question about how a clinton could promote change after decades of a clinton or bush in power . `` it did take a clinton to clean up after the first bush , and i think it might take another one to clean up after the second bush , '' she said . watch clinton make a jab at bush '' the longest and loudest applause line of the night came when cnn 's wolf blitzer noted that many democrats have said they 'd like to see a clinton-obama or obama-clinton ticket in november . neither ruled out the possibility of selecting the other as a running mate . watch the rivals discuss joining forces '' `` the debate was a rallying debate for democrats , '' said cnn senior political analyst bill schneider . `` democrats like both of them , they continue to like both of them , and they want to vote for both of them . '' schneider said the cordial tone probably helped both candidates . obama continued momentum from his victory in the south carolina primary and high-profile endorsements , including sen. ted kennedy and kansas gov. kathleen sebelius . clinton probably maintained her perceived status as the front-runner . `` i 'm not sure that he turned the election around , '' schneider said . `` he is the challenger here -- he 's got to persuade people they do n't want to vote for her . '' the debate , sponsored by cnn , the los angeles times and politico.com , was held at los angeles ' kodak theatre , where the academy awards are handed out . hundreds , if not thousands , of clinton and obama supporters thronged outside the venue -- cheering and waving signs . the numerous actors , directors and musicians in the audience included stevie wonder , pierce brosnan , rob reiner , jason alexander , isaiah washington , diane keaton , leonardo dicaprio , quentin tarantino and christina applegate . mike gravel , the other democratic presidential candidate still in the race , was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria , including support in national polls . in a cnn/opinion research corporation poll conducted january 14-17 , gravel received less than 1 percent . e-mail to a friend .

'' further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume thursday , he said . u.s. president george w. bush has pushed for the admission of ukraine and georgia to the military alliance . however , russia -- which is not a nato member -- has expressed concerns about the former soviet republics joining nato , which has already made members of other former soviet countries latvia , lithuania , and estonia . appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on macedonia 's bid , because of greece 's objections . greece has threatened to veto macedonia 's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name . athens has long argued that the name macedonia implies territorial claims on its northern province of the same name -- the birthplace , also , of greece 's most revered ancient warrior , alexander the great . the name issue must be resolved by the two countries , appathurai said . e-mail to a friend .
663	san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in a recent commentary , i wrote that , as a mexican-american , the ugliness of the immigration debate offends me -- not as a mexican , but as an american . ruben navarrette jr. lists 10 things u.s.-born hispanics find distasteful about the immigration debate . a woman wrote in and asked me to be more specific : just what was it about the immigration debate that was so ugly ? she came to the right place . after nearly 20 years of writing opinions and insisting that i do n't speak for all hispanics , in recent months , i 've heard from hundreds of hispanics who -- appreciative of my middle-ground approach to the immigration issue -- insist that i can speak for them anytime . so , with the authority vested in me , i 'll now share some of what other hispanics are saying . it 's not far off from what janet murguia had to say . as president of the national council of la raza , the largest hispanic civil rights organization in the united states , murguia recently delivered an important speech to the national press club . the topic : the immigration debate and what she called a wave of hate sweeping the land -- one that is n't limited to illegal immigrants , but which is now affecting all hispanics regardless of where they were born , what language they speak or what flag they salute . the way murguia sees it , immigration is `` on the verge of becoming one of the largest civil rights issues of our generation . '' and , hispanics are playing the piñata . murguia was right on the button . to borrow a phrase , it 's getting ugly out there . and u.s.-born hispanics see it as plain as day . here are 10 things they find distasteful about this debate : . • the hypocrisy . we have two signs on the u.s.-mexican border : `` keep out '' and `` help wanted . '' • the racism . with lightning speed , the debate went from anti-illegal immigrant to anti-immigrant to anti-mexican . • the opportunism . too many politicians are trying too hard to portray themselves as tough on illegal immigration . • the simple solutions . `` build a wall . '' `` deport all illegals . '' a quick rule of thumb : if it fits on a bumper sticker , it 's not a workable policy . • the naiveté . people ask why mexico wo n't help stop illegal immigration . hint : last year , mexicans in the united states sent home $ 25 billion . • the profiling . dark skin and spanish surnames should n't be proxies for undocumented status . been to arizona lately ? • the meanness . nazi-produced internet video games let players shoot illegal immigrants crossing the border . fun stuff . • the amnesia . americans think grandpa was welcomed with open arms and that he plunged into the melting pot . whatever . • the buck-passing . americans love to blame mexico for their choices , yelling across the border : `` stop us before we hire again . '' • the double standard . the same folks who have zero tolerance for illegal immigrants easily tolerate those who hire them . some of this is painfully familiar , recalling earlier versions of this debate as it played out a hundred or two hundred years ago . hispanics are the new germans , the new irish , the new italians . but it 's also ugly . it was then . it is now . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .

's ambitions to join in on this growth . cnn 's john defterios -lrb- jd -rrb- sits down with shaukat aziz -lrb- sa -rrb- , former prime minister to pakistan to talk about the emerging relationship . former pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz . aziz is an expert in global banking who worked in the middle east for a number of years as an official for citigroup . he was an influential player in the process of creating a free trade agreement between pakistan and china , after visiting the country in 2005 . shaukat aziz talks about the growing ties between china and the middle east , and gives us inside knowledge on doing business in china . -lrb- sa -rrb- : i think the two economies are complementary . china is a global economy which is growing rapidly . it has one of the highest growth rates in the world , and it is expanding its footprint all over the world . dubai and the u.a.e. is clearly a hub for south asia , the middle east , and the whole region . they are a trading center , they are a financial center , and they do n't compete directly with china , in fact both economies will compliment each other . i think the u.a.e. prime minister 's trip will help to further reinforce this and get the two countries closer together , in trade , in financial flows , in linking capital markets and many other initiatives . -lrb- jd -rrb- : trade has been growing 30 to 40 percent over the last four years . but can it move beyond hard chinese goods going into the gulf ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : of course it can . i think the nature of dubai is such that it has now become the clearing house for goods from all over the world . and buyers go to dubai and look for the best product at the best price . so , if china , being a large country , can bring its products to dubai , it will help both countries . may i also say that i see china evolving as an exporter of capital , not just goods because china is running huge surpluses . their reserves are at an all time high . so they are looking for investments too , and you see now a trend in chinese companies to buy companies overseas . a trend in chinese companies to invest overseas because they want , once they go global , they want production facilities all over the world . so the design and the research and development will be done in china , the components will come from china , but the manufacturing could move across the world . this trend is already started and i think this will all go well for both countries . -lrb- jd -rrb- : lets take it a step further . do you see chinese investment funds or sovereign funds and u.a.e. sovereign funds going out together to acquire companies in the near future ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : sure , there have been situations where both have participated in different companies . -lrb- jd -rrb- : but separately . -lrb- sa -rrb- : separately , but i think they could join too . but the real issue on sovereign funds is being represented in certain quarters as if this is something which is unhelpful to the global economy . in my view , in an era of globalization we must open up our markets for investments and let anybody come along in line with the rules of that country . may i say that the sovereignty of any country is a very robust concept . and if a foreign sovereign fund or investor comes along and buys a bank in a particular country , the countries sovereignty is never jeopardized . but , if you have good regulators and good policies , because even in a deregulated environment , regulation is necessary . deregulation does not mean abdication by the government , so if your regulatory regime is sound , you do n't have to worry . sovereign funds have demonstrated that they have helped promote economic activity , help save certain companies , banks as a case in point . and it 's a win-win for both sides . so i think this question of their role is over stated . -lrb- jd -rrb- : saudi arabia 's king abdullah went to visit china when he came into power in early 2006 . is itinevitable that u.s.-european allies in the gulf turn to the east now and look for new partnerships in an east-east equation ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : this is the fastest growing economy in the world . it is absorbing foreign investment , it is exporting investment . it is the largest producer of goods and services now , in terms of growth rate . so saudi arabia , naturally , the largest economy in the middle east by a long margin , needs to link up a country like china . i think it is not geo-politics which is driving it . it is economic necessity . it is tapping into growth . saudi companies are investing in china . i know that in the energy sector aramco has gone in for joint ventures and maybe sabic too , and that is to me a very positive development . because it is showing that capital looks for opportunities and if there is return china is not far enough . e-mail to a friend .

667	seoul , south korea -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- south korea will open its market to most u.s. beef , a senior government official said thursday , according to state media . thousands of people have taken to the streets of the south korean capital in protest at the deal . south korea banned imports of u.s. beef in 2003 amid concerns over a case of mad cow disease in the united states . the ban closed what was then the third-largest market for u.s. beef exporters . it resumed limited imports last year -- allowing boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age -- but that re-opening was subject to interruptions and closed altogether in october 2007 . a deal that south korea and the united states struck last month bans the import of high-risk materials , like tonsils , brains , spinal cord marrow and a section of the small intestine , agriculture minister chung woon-chun said thursday , according to south korea 's yonhap news agency . these parts pose the greatest risk of transmitting mad cow disease to humans . the ban will be lifted within a few days , once the government 's new import rules have been published . the pending resumption of u.s. beef imports has n't been without political costs for president lee myung-bak . he apologized to the nation last week for failing to fully understand concerns about mad cow disease . in downtown seoul , thousands of people have regularly staged protests , chanting `` we do n't want crazy cows , '' since the deal to revive beef imports was announced . and the main opposition party has taken up the fight . `` we will be forced to make a critical decision if the government pushes through its plan to announce resumption of beef imports , '' said sohn hak-kyu , leader of the main opposition united democratic party , yonhap reported . `` if the government and the ruling party ignore this warning , we will come up with every possible measure to stop them . '' the opposition has already filed a suit to suspend implementation of new beef import terms , according to yonhap . lee 's ruling grand national party -lrb- gnp -rrb- is working to soothe tensions , saying that american beef is safe to eat and that adequate safety precautions have been taken . `` the government has tried its best to free the public from unnecessary concerns , and sufficient countermeasures have been prepared , '' said lee hahn-koo , the party 's chief policymaker , yonhap reported . when south korea and the united states reached the deal in april to re-open the south korean market , they removed the major obstacle to u.s. congressional approval of the korea-u.s. free trade agreement -lrb- fta -rrb- . lee urged the national assembly this month to ratify the agreement as soon as possible to provide fresh impetus to the sluggish korean economy , saying it will create 300,000 jobs . but the opposition has promised to fight the fta until the beef pact is nullified . in 2003 , the united states exported $ 815 million pounds of beef and beef variety meats to south korea . the u.s. beef industry has lost up to $ 4 billion since the market closed , according to the u.s. meat export federation .

'' the last time both teams met was in a qualifying play-off for the 2006 world cup , when switzerland prevailed on away goals . the game was , however , marred by violent incidents involving players from both sides following the final whistle although kuhn believes any ill feeling has passed . `` this issue is almost three years old now and as in everyday life football evolves very quickly , '' he said . `` this thing is over and done with . '' switzerland will have all their players available with the exception of frei , who has been ruled out for the tournament having sustained a knee injury in his team 's opener . `` frei can not play , '' said kuhn . `` but he is very important for us and he will remain with the team as he is such a big support for us .

670	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- responding to recent accidents linked to pilot fatigue , federal safety officials hope reduce airline pilots ' logging 14-hour days . the faa currently allows pilots to log 14-hour workdays , which the ntsb says contributes to accidents . the national transportation safety board concluded in a report out tuesday that pilot fatigue was a probable cause in a runway landing accident during bad weather in michigan last winter . there were no fatalities . the federal aviation administration currently allows a 14-hour workday with eight hours of logged airtime . `` it 's a critical issue ; it 's an insidious issue . many times , the pilots themselves do n't even recognize that they are fatigued when they get into that cockpit , '' ntsb chairman mark rosenker said . and rosenker made the same points about air traffic controllers more than a year ago , in april 2007 . in a letter to the faa , rosenker said that four other plane incidents `` provide clear and compelling evidence '' that controllers are sometimes operating while fatigued because of their work schedules and poor use of rest periods . `` that fatigue has contributed to controller errors , '' rosenker wrote in 2007 . `` fourteen hours is still a very long day , '' ntsb board member debbie hersman said . her conclusion is backed by 40 years of airline accident statistics compiled by the faa and cited tuesday at an ntsb hearing . `` after a duty period of about 10 to 12 hours , the number of observed accidents increased exponentially , '' ntsb staff member malcolm brenner said . in february , the cockpit crew of a passenger plane operated by mesa airlines failed to answer air traffic controllers for 18 minutes , missed the flight 's destination in hawaii and continued for another 15 miles at 21,000 feet over the pacific ocean . the investigation has shown that `` both pilots unintentionally fell asleep during cruise flight , '' ntsb staff member jena price said during a presentation to the safety board . the crew of go ! flight 1002 eventually answered concerned calls on the radio from ground controllers , turned around and safely landed . the ntsb report called for analysis of sleep quantity , sleep quality , performance , errors and incidents traced to schedules that disrupt sleep patterns , perhaps while stretching workloads to the maximum allowed . `` they can not just keep pushing pilots until they drop , '' said the head of the air line pilots association , rory kay . he said during a break in the ntsb hearing that `` pilot pushing '' is an issue . `` we are in tough economic times , we 're being asked to do more with less , and we have to support the pilot when he makes the determination that it 's time to call it quits , '' he said . after reviewing some possible remedies against fatigue in the cockpit , board members unanimously approved the proposal to the faa , which would be responsible for developing guidance for the airlines to carry out . the faa plans to hold a symposium on fatigue management next week with representatives from the aviation industry . `` i want the faa to have a complete overhaul of the flight time/duty time regulations '' that presently allow a 14-hour day with eight hours of flight time , kay said .
671	los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the man whose investigation of president clinton provided reams of tabloid fodder is now working to help crack down on photographers working for the very publications his efforts once filled . photographers surround singer britney spears ' car in los angeles , california , in october . kenneth starr -- the independent counsel whose open-ended investigation of a clinton land deal veered into an intimately detailed report on the president 's affair with intern monica lewinsky -- is helping california lawmakers craft laws to crack down on celebrity-hunting packs of paparazzi . malibu mayor pamela conley ulich contacted starr , now a law school dean at pepperdine university in malibu . local governments in los angeles and west hollywood are also part of the effort to curb what they call a dangerous and expensive problem . `` just imagine you 're a motorist driving down the street and britney spears parks next to you ; all of a sudden you 're swarmed by these people , '' los angeles city councilman dennis zine said . `` they 've got cameras ; they 're jumping on the hood of my car . `` you do n't know if you 're getting carjacked . you do n't know what 's happening . '' the idea of a `` safe zone '' around celebrities has been kicked around by l.a.-area lawmakers for years . the push became more intense in the wake of multiple mob scenes around pop star spears last year , including a virtual siege of her studio city , california , home and similar scenes during her trips to hospitals . starr has been in contact with the officials but is `` not ready to publicly comment '' on any plan he may have , according to a pepperdine spokesperson . lawmakers have set no timetable for when they 'd like to have laws drafted . police chief william j. bratton has argued that there 's no need for new laws to deal with the problem . but zine and others argue that police resources are stretched thin by the current state of things , citing $ 25,000 shelled out last year for a police escort for spears . to some , starr -- the man vilified by liberals for a lengthy and costly clinton investigation that turned up clinton 's personal foibles but no major wrongdoing in the whitewater land deals -- seems an odd partner for politicians in the notoriously left-leaning los angeles area . `` the irony is that he was so criticized , so vilified by hollywood liberals 10 years ago during the monica lewinsky impeachment saga , '' said david mark , a senior editor at politico . `` now he 's kind of aligned himself with a lot of malibu residents who probably disagree with him politically . '' but zine , who has been a prime backer of laws curbing the `` pap packs , '' said starr 's expertise will be valuable as lawmakers try to strike a balance between public safety and first amendment freedom of the press concerns . `` i have a lot of respect for ken starr , '' zine said . `` we do n't want to violate any rules . we do n't want to violate the constitution . `` we believe that the constitution needs to be upheld -lsb- but -rsb- at the same time , we need to protect our celebrities .

'' nonetheless , he said , in iraq and afghanistan , there is a clear definition of success : when those countries are rid of al qaeda , when they are economically viable , when they are democracies that can govern effectively and when they are strong allies on the war on terror . `` these successes will come , '' he told the class . `` and when they do , our nation will have achieved victory , and the american people will be more secure .

'' begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country . since the country 's independence in 1972 , the awami league or the bnp has ruled bangladesh for all but eight years . both women have served as prime minister at one point or another . after its last stint in power ended in 2006 , the bnp handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections , as mandated by the country 's constitution . but the awami league refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government . hasina accused zia of stocking it with bnp backers . supporters and party members took to the streets in months of deadly clashes . to stem the tide of violence , a military-backed government took control in january 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency . it also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country 's graft-ridden politics . the caretaker government adopted the emergency powers rules . the rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime , human rights watch said . a wave of detentions followed . by some estimates more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes . among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians , including hasina and zia -- leading to the current political stalemate . the government wants to hold elections in the third week of december , and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting . the political parties allege the arrests are intended to pave the way for the election of pro-government candidates . they want their leaders set free before they sit down and talk with the government about a roadmap toward a successful election . they also threatened to organize mass movements to secure their leaders ' release . `` it 's kind of an impasse , '' said taleya rehman , founder and executive director of the bangladesh-based non-profit democracy watch . `` the government is conducting political dialogue with small parties . but they are of no significance . they need the two major parties . '' on monday , the government announced it was releasing hasina from custody on medical grounds so she can go abroad for treatment . a similar release for zia was also expected . party members say the government 's move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country . hasina has a damaged ear resulting from a bombing attack that targeted her four years ago . zia is believed to have arthritis . meanwhile , the detentions continue -- almost 1,800 a day . in addition to political party members , the crackdown has also swept up several journalists . `` that actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people 's minds , '' said sultana kamal , executive director of the legal aid group , ain o salish kendro -lrb- law and adjudication center -rrb- . `` if you just arrest any tom , dick and harry saying this person may have arms , then people will legitimately raise questions about the mode of the whole operation .

676	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- the legend of jack daniel reaches all the way back to the moment he was born . unfortunately , nobody knows exactly when that was . jack daniel believed the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey . some records show that jasper newton `` jack '' daniel came into the world on september 5 , 1846 . his tombstone , however , says 1850 . strange , because his mother died in 1847 . all of this might not normally matter , but jack 's birth date is important to his overall legend , which proudly proclaims him `` the boy distiller . '' so perhaps it 's best we begin when jack was first introduced to whiskey , which we know was early in life . leaving home at a young age , jack struck out on his own with nothing more than a handful of items valued at $ 9 . he ended up at the home of dan call , a preacher at a nearby lutheran church and the owner of a general store . there , reverend call also happened to sell whiskey that he distilled himself . jack quickly became determined to learn the craft . in fact , many storytellers claim the boy wonder bought the still from call and began pursuing the business full-time at the ripe age of 16 . if that legend is true , then jack began selling his own tennessee whiskey only three years later ; the famous black labels on the company bottles proudly pronounce , `` established and registered in 1866 . '' in reality , no documents support that myth . jack may have been a teenage moonshiner , but he did n't register his business with the federal government until 1875 . and by then , jack would have been the more booze-appropriate age of 29 . the maker makes his mark . whatever legends exist , one thing is certain : jack daniel had a brilliant mind for marketing . even as a youngster , jack understood that if people remembered him , they would remember his whiskey . to that end , he decked himself out in a formal knee-length coat , a vest , a tie , and a wide-brim planter 's hat , and was never caught out of `` uniform '' again . jack also established the jack daniel 's silver cornet band -- a 10-member outfit solely devoted to promoting his whiskey across the countryside . with uniforms and instruments from the sears & roebuck catalog and a specially designed wagon for traveling , jack made sure the band played every saloon opening , fourth of july celebration , and political rally around . but perhaps jack 's most brilliant decision concerned how to present his whiskey . from the beginning , jack had been one of the first sellers to stencil his distillery name on his whiskey jugs . next , he upgraded to round , custom-embossed bottles . but when a glass salesman showed him a prototype square bottle in 1895 , jack realized he 'd stumbled upon something unique . the new bottles not only stood out from the crowd , but also had a shape that would prevent them from rolling around and breaking during transport . in addition , the square look reinforced the idea that jack was a square dealer who put honest work and high standards first . whatever effort jack daniel put into his marketing , he never let quality slip . in 1904 , the distiller decided on a whim to enter his whiskey in the taste competition at the st. louis world 's fair . it came as little surprise when he won . lucky no. 7 . perhaps jack 's greatest coup was the name he gave his high-quality product -- old no. 7 . naturally , nobody seems to know why . the official historian at the jack daniel distillery today says it 's the most oft-asked question on factory tours . as you might imagine , many theories have been advanced . jack had seven girlfriends . jack believed the number seven was lucky . jack was honoring a merchant friend who owned seven stores that distributed jack 's liquor . jack misplaced a batch of whiskey for seven years and , upon finding it , labeled it `` old no. 7 . '' none of these stories , however , makes as much sense as the less-than-sexy explanation from jack daniel biographer peter krass . simply put , jack was originally assigned a district tax assessment number of 7 . but when the irs consolidated districts within tennessee , they arbitrarily reassigned him the number 16 . jack did n't want to confuse his loyal consumers , and he certainly did n't want to bend to the government , so he began labeling his bottles `` old no. 7 . '' more than 125 years later , this act of defiance still makes his labels stand out . jack without jill . jack daniel never married . some say it 's because he was married to his work ; others say it 's because he never found a girl who measured up to his high standards . or perhaps it 's just that he was too busy catering to the greater lynchburg population -- throwing elaborate christmas feasts , hosting exquisite costume parties in his second-story ballroom , and donating money to every church in moore county . but by all accounts , jack was quite a ladies ' man . he was a perfect dance partner , a polite conversationalist , and a fantastic gift-giver . unfortunately , he also gravitated toward girls young enough to be his daughter -lrb- or even granddaughter -rrb- . once , jack even asked for a woman 's hand in marriage , but her father denied him -- partly because jack enjoyed keeping his own legend alive and always hesitated to reveal his true birth date . when jack proposed , her father made it clear that any man unwilling to disclose his age was `` a little too old for such a young girl . '' the early bird gets the gangrene . hard as it might be to believe , in the end , the great distiller actually died from getting to work too early . as the story goes , one morning in 1906 , jack arrived at his office before anybody else . he tried to access the company safe , but had a terrible time remembering the code . after a few frustrating minutes , he kicked the safe as hard as he could . he badly bruised his left foot and immediately began to walk with a limp . the limp only grew worse with time , and he later discovered the injury had led to blood poisoning . then came gangrene , then amputation , and then , five years later , death . it 's not the happiest ending for the story , or the clearest cut , but it is the best , because it adds to the mystery and mystique of jack daniel . as they say , where facts can not be found , legends fill the empty space and that 's perfectly fine for the keepers of the company flame . after all , as jack himself believed , the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .
677	tokyo , japan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a u.s. marine accused of raping a 19-year-old japanese woman last year was found guilty thursday of `` committing wrongful sexual contact and indecent acts , '' the u.s. military said , but he was acquitted of rape . the sentencing hearing for lance cpl. larry a. dean , 20 , is scheduled to begin on friday . dean is among four marines under court-martial in the case . the others are sgt. lanaeus j. braswell , 25 ; gunnery sgt. carl m. anderson , 39 ; and gunnery sgt. jarvis d. raynor , 34 , the military said . local media reported that the four men met the woman in a restaurant in hiroshima on october 14 , 2007 , then allegedly attacked and raped her in a car in nearby parking lot . japanese authorities investigated but decided in november not to file charges . dean also was found guilty of conspiracy to commit indecent acts and two minor charges . he was acquitted of conspiracy to kidnap or rape . the case is similar to a recent alleged sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl involving a u.s. marine on the southern japanese island of okinawa . that case sparked outrage and stirred memories of an earlier rape committed by u.s. servicemen . staff sgt. tyrone luther hadnott , 38 , was charged last month with the rape of a child under 16 , abusive sexual contact with a child , making a false official statement , adultery and kidnapping , the military said . in february , japanese authorities released hadnott after the girl dropped the allegations , but the marine corps conducted its own investigation to see if hadnott violated codes of military justice . the military is holding him at a marine facility . more than 40,000 u.s. troops are stationed in japan , most of them on okinawa , which accounts for less than 1 percent of japan 's total area . the u.s. military presence has at times bred resentment among locals , who have long complained about crime , noise and accidents . anti-american sentiment boiled over in 1995 , after three american servicemen were convicted in the kidnapping and gang rape of a 12-year-old okinawan schoolgirl . two years ago , a u.s. civilian military employee was jailed for nine years for raping two women .

683	editor 's note : cnn.com 's wayne drash writes about his maniacal love for university of memphis basketball . memphis , north carolina , ucla and kansas play in the final four this weekend . drash says the memphis team can help heal the city 's old wounds . cnn.com 's wayne drash , left , says he 's been hooked on university of memphis basketball since he was a kid . atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- my love for university of memphis basketball is completely irrational . i never went to school there and have no affiliation with the university . but i bleed tiger blue . my dad used to take my brothers and me to memphis games as a kid , and i 've been hooked ever since . we once bought tickets from a scalper for six bucks apiece against arch-rival the university of louisville in the 1980s . my dad complained we paid too much . but then we moved in seventh grade . i became an even bigger fan after we left the city . i 'd huddle over my am radio , hooked up with a coat hanger wrapped in aluminum foil as an antenna . more than 350 miles away , i managed to pick up the then-memphis state games through the crackle and static of the radio . memphis basketball was my only way to remain connected to my youth and the city that i loved . that was 1985 , the last time memphis made the final four . is your team in the final four ? send your ireport celebratory photos . back then , memphis was led by a phenom named keith lee . he was best known for a sweet baseline jumper as soft as the nylon nets he swished . he was also known for his giant afro . he was listed as 6 feet 10 inches . the joke was if you included his wild hairdo , he was 7-4 . when my parents were away at work , sometimes i 'd sneak into my mom 's cabinet , steal her mousse and then put it in my hair . then this white kid would go out back and shoot hoops for hours , hair sticking straight out like i stuck my finger in a socket . it was the only way i could be like lee , my hero and idol . back then , memphians would rank lee right up there with elvis presley as the city 's most popular icons . many still do . and that 's the thing about tiger basketball . in a place where race has often divided so much of it , memphis basketball has helped unite the city . as a boy , white and black kids would crowd the basketball court at tiger games to try to snatch the players ' sweatbands as they raced into the locker room . up until i graduated from high school , the sweatbands of phillip `` doom '' haynes and baskerville `` batman '' holmes sat on my shelf in my room . like a fan of any team , there have been good and bad times over the years . but sometimes the pain of being a tiger fan is that much greater . tragedy and heartbreak are part of it , such as when holmes killed his girlfriend and then himself in 1997 . other players , such as aaron price and a. maceo battle , have died far too young along the way , furthering the pain of being a fan . larry finch -- who as a black player brought together the city and took memphis to its only national championship game in 1973 , and later became one of its greatest coaches -- has lived much of the past few years in a rehabilitation center after suffering severe strokes . in some ways , that 's what makes memphis basketball so special . memphis players embody the real life of so many americans , many faced with extreme hard times . some succeed ; some do n't . others , such as finch , keep on fighting . i do n't find it an accident that memphis is now seeking history the same week of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the rev. martin luther king jr. `` i think dr. king would find this a source of joy , '' the rev. jesse jackson told the team this week , according to the memphis commercial appeal newspaper . a city that has seen so much pain , so much heartache , has something huge to celebrate -- all revolving around young college kids and a bouncy orange ball . the adage is that sports often have the ability to transcend the moment . this is one of those times . to get to the championship game monday night , memphis must first get past ucla , the same team that defeated it in that 1973 title game . while much of the rest of the nation has the team pegged to lose , the tigers -- for one shining moment -- have a chance to do something really special . they 'd have it no other way . as for me ? i wo n't be listening on my old radio , but this weekend i might just try sporting that ` do like keith lee . the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of the writers . e-mail to a friend .
684	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the world 's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of the human impact on the environment , the world wildlife fund said friday . these two adult frilled-neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in australia . the wwf 's latest living planet index shows terrestrial , freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005 , with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop . the index is included in a report called `` 2010 and beyond : rising to the biodiversity challenge , '' which the wwf prepared for an international biodiversity conference in germany later this month . `` no one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines , greater vulnerability to natural disasters , and greater effects from global warming , '' said james leape , director-general of wwf international . the living planet index measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species , which the wwf says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends . terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35-year period , the wwf said . marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period , with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005 , the wwf said . `` many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence , and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world 's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched , '' the wwf report said . freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003 . the wwf said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet , inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species . in tropical regions , freshwater species were especially hard-hit ; the index shows they suffered a 35-percent drop between 1970 and 2000 . the wwf said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003 . the causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere , such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems , the wwf said . the dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species ' capacity to replace itself , the wwf said . overfishing is one example . overexploitation is also a threat to terrestrial species , according to the report , which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals . overharvesting of timber is also a major factor , it said . invasive species , whether introduced deliberately or not , are another threat , especially in freshwater ecosystems , where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species , the wwf said . pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity , it said . the wwf called on governments attending this month 's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010 . it wants governments to establish protected areas , particularly those areas important for food security , water supply , medicine , and disaster mitigation , and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020 .
685	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- three protesters scaled the golden gate bridge monday and unfurled a `` free tibet '' banner , a likely precursor to large protests when the olympic torch arrives wednesday in san francisco , california . members of students for a free tibet climbed the bridge to place these banners , said the group 's spokesman . the banner read , `` one world . one dream . free tibet . '' those who climbed cables from which the bridge is suspended are members of students for a free tibet , said group spokesman tenzin dasang . the three were arrested along with four others at the site . all seven were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance , said california highway patrol officer mary ziegenbein . the climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing . watch protesters and banner hung from bridge '' the incident forced the closure of one northbound lane of the bridge . the climbers -- who were on the bridge for about three hours -- came down voluntarily about 1:15 p.m. -lrb- 4:15 p.m. et -rrb- after workers with the golden gate bridge district began cutting down their banner , ziegenbein said . dasang said he has heard of many people planning to protest in san francisco against china 's human rights record . `` we want it to be peaceful . but it will be large , '' said dasang , 22 , during a phone interview in which he said he was near the bridge . `` i heard from tibetans that now live all over the u.s. and even abroad who are coming here . '' the olympic flame is on a 130-day journey that will take it through 23 cities on five continents and then throughout china , culminating at the olympics opening ceremony in beijing august 8 . the san francisco protest comes the same day as a demonstration in paris , france , disrupted the torch relay many times . in paris , police had to cut the olympic torch relay short monday amid protests against china 's human rights record , french police said . the torch was scheduled to travel 17 miles , past paris city hall , but that stop and others were called off after the protests . the torch made it through about 10 miles of its scheduled journey . it was then driven by bus to its final destination , where it was displayed again during a public ceremony at a stadium . authorities had to play hide-and-seek with the olympic torch during much of the route , placing it on a bus at least twice during a sometimes chaotic relay route . china has come under international criticism because of its crackdown last month on protesters calling for democratic freedoms and self-rule in tibet and neighboring chinese provinces . protesters have said more than 100 people have died in the crackdown , but beijing denies that and has accused supporters of the dalai lama of orchestrating the violence . u.s. and other western leaders have called on china to provide civil rights and freedoms to those in tibet and to enter peaceful discussions aimed at resolving the crisis . e-mail to a friend .
686	madrid , spain -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the search is back on for words to the spanish national anthem . spain 's basketball team : able to hum the national anthem , but not sing words . the lack of lyrics in spain 's anthem has long created awkward moments for winning spanish athletes at the olympics . they stand on the podium silently or hum along while winning athletes from other nations sing when their anthem is played during their moment of triumph . with the summer olympic games fast-approaching , the spanish olympic committee stirred the lyric-writing impulses of spaniards by sponsoring a competition to provide words for the anthem . the contest drew 7,000 entries , and an expert panel selected a winner . the committee announced plans for renowned spanish tenor placido domingo to sing the lyrics on monday . then , suddenly , the committee discarded the winning lyrics . `` once spaniards heard these lyrics , they sparked a lot of controversy , even rejection , '' alejandro blanco , president of the spanish olympic committee , told a packed news conference this week . the now-discarded winning lyrics had begun with , `` viva espana , '' or `` long-live spain , '' and critics complained that phrase harkened back to the right-wing dictatorship of general francisco franco , who led a military uprising in 1936 against the elected government and won a civil war , ruling spain until his death in 1975 . `` you have to consider that many spaniards do n't consider the national anthem as their own . it was played a lot under franco , '' said margarita saenz-diez , a journalist . spain is now a democracy , but many still bristle at the military march that 's served for more than two centuries as the national anthem . spain is made up of many different peoples , and five languages are spoken across the country . the catalans in the northeast and the basques in the north already have their own national songs with lyrics . getting agreement on any lyrics to the national anthem is no easy task and would ultimately have to be approved by parliament . the president of the spanish olympic committee conceded he does n't know when there will be lyrics for the anthem , and many here say there is n't enough time to get lyrics approved before the aug. 8 start of the summer olympic games in beijing . yet the search goes on . `` we will continue with the idea of an anthem with lyrics , '' blanco said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's al goodman contributed to this report .

688	jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.n. security council failed to reach a consensus when it met to consider condemning an attack that killed eight people at a prominent jewish seminary as an act of terrorism . ambulance workers put one of the casualties from the seminary attack into an ambulance . the council said libya -- a new , nonpermanent member -- blocked the statement on thursday night . ibrahim dabbashi , libya 's deputy ambassador to the united nations , said the attack on the school was no different than israeli military offensives against militants in gaza . but dan gillerman , israel 's ambassador to the united nations , said he saw no connection between thursday 's shooting and israel 's operations in gaza . `` this is not a story of retaliation , '' he said . `` these people have been terrorizing israel for years , have been carrying out suicide bombings and indiscriminate attacks for years . '' a gunman broke into the jewish seminary about 8:30 p.m. , spraying automatic-weapons fire , authorities said . most of the victims were students in their teens and 20s , medical officials said . at least nine others were wounded before an off-duty israel defense forces officer fatally shot the gunman , jerusalem district police commander aharon franko said . the gunman was carrying an ak-47 and a pistol -- and had time to swap weapons during the massacre . police are trying to identify the gunman and figure out how he managed , while drawing little notice , to enter the large three-story school in a bustling residential neighborhood . `` there was no alert or warning about this attack , '' franko said . watch the immediate aftermath of the attack '' a first responder said the bodies were on the floor of the study hall surrounded by holy books . no group has claimed responsibility for the attack . video from thursday 's scene showed a frantic crowd of rescue workers carrying bloodied victims into ambulances . dozens of police officers were scouring the campus and streets around the yeshiva in case there were other gunmen . outside the school , scores of israeli men gathered from surrounding neighborhoods , demanding justice for the attack . authorities are calling the incident at west jerusalem 's merkaz harav yeshiva an act of terrorism . the school is one of the largest seminaries in israel , with about 500 students in the yeshiva and 200 in an advanced graduate program . `` israel is at the forefront of the struggle against terrorism and will continue to defend its citizens , who are exposed to this threat on a daily basis , '' israel 's foreign ministry said in a written statement . `` israel expects the nations of the world to support it in its war against those who murder students , women and children , by any means and with respect for neither place nor target . '' president bush backed israeli leaders in a statement issued thursday , saying , `` i condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack in jerusalem that targeted innocent students at the merkaz harav yeshiva . this barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the condemnation of every nation . '' but libya 's dabbashi compared the attack with `` bloodshed in the palestinian territory . '' `` for us , the human lives are the same . we judge the incident itself , '' dabbashi told reporters after the security council meeting . `` when we have to condemn the killing of the israeli civilians , we also have to look at what 's happening in gaza . '' jerusalem security increased . security was bolstered , with thousands of additional officers across jerusalem and the rest of israel , authorities said . meanwhile , celebratory shooting took place in gaza city after the news of the attack , with hundreds chanting and clapping in the streets . but palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas criticized the killings . `` the palestinian authority condemns any attack on innocent civilians , '' abbas ' office said in a written statement . the shootings came just a day after u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , who met with both israelis and palestinians , announced that peace talks will resume between the two sides . abbas suspended peace negotiations last week after fierce fighting broke out between israel and palestinian militants in gaza , but he agreed to resume negotiations after meeting with rice . israel will continue peace talks with the palestinians regardless of the attack in jerusalem , foreign ministry spokesman aryeh mekel said thursday . israel conducted a large-scale operation in gaza to hunt down palestinian militants who have been firing dozens of rockets into israel . at least 70 palestinians and two israeli soldiers were killed during the operation , israeli and palestinian sources said . militants also fired at least 25 rockets toward israel , wounding at least two civilians . `` this operation came directly after the attack committed inside gaza . this operation is a normal response , '' said fawzi barhoom , a hamas spokesman in gaza . watch barhoom 's reaction to the attack '' gillerman said the security council should condemn the attack . `` they are so , so quick sometimes to criticize israel for defending itself . i would like to see those members convene as we speak in order to condemn this in the strongest possible terms . '' thursday 's attack was the worst inside israel since april 17 , 2006 , when a suicide bombing outside a falafel restaurant in tel aviv killed nine people . islamic jihad claimed responsibility for that attack . attacks in jerusalem are rare . eight people were wounded august 10 in the old city when a palestinian resident grabbed a security guard 's gun and fired ; and four israeli security guards were wounded may 26 when two palestinian gunmen began firing in east jerusalem . all three of the assailants were killed . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ben wedeman and atika shubert contributed to this report .
689	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- on march 30 the open skies treaty went into effect , liberalizing air travel between the u.s. and europe . but how will the ease of restrictions on transatlantic routes affect business travelers ? under open skies , european and u.s. airlines will be given unlimited access between europe and u.s. points . the treaty puts an end to the exclusive arrangement granted to british airways , virgin atlantic , united airlines and american airlines to fly transatlantic out of london heathrow . but with the airport currently operating at almost-maximum capacity , new flights will be severely limited . as a result competition is fierce for heathrow slots , with airlines paying as much as $ 60 million to get their hands on them . for each flight that is added , another less lucrative service is scrapped . airlines are giving priority to high-yield business routes to and from heathrow . while european carriers are now allowed to fly from any point within e.u across the atlantic , the u.s. domestic market remains closed to them . operators in europe hope that a second phase of the open skies deal will mean a relaxation of restrictions on european airlines ' investment in u.s. carriers and the ability for european airlines to compete in the u.s. domestic market . the issue is pending in u.s. congress . if the u.s. does n't deliver , there is a clause in the agreement that states the open skies treaty -- phase i included -- can be torn up . industry experts foresee some fare wars in both economy and business-class . service options are also likely to improve as competition intensifies . u.s. airlines will vie with ba , the dominant carrier at heathrow , that currently has flights to 24 u.s. cities . the biggest challenge to the incumbent airlines operating out of heathrow will come from carriers in the skyteam alliance , that includes air france and klm , delta air lines , northwest airlines news , and continental airlines . before open skies , the skyteam alliance offered no transatlantic routes to and from heathrow . by summer they will offer 10 percent of these flights . skyteam carriers will be located for the first time in terminal 4 . given the size of the market for u.s.-london flights , airlines will continue to offer services from gatwick , london 's second-busiest airport . open skies will intensify competition for ailing u.s. airlines on what has been their most profitable route . analysts expect to see consolidation between u.s. airlines as they combine international networks to beat competition . one advantage u.s. airlines can offer is opportunity for connecting flights to other european cities as well as on to asia and the mideast . european carriers on the other hand , can not operate domestic flights within the u.s. new flights and new airlines . oneworld alliance . british airways will shift its dallas and houston services from gatwick to heathrow and its warsaw operation to gatwick . flights to detroit and harare will be axed . in june , the airline will also launch services between continental europe and new york . operated by subsidiary openskies , the daily flights will fly from either jfk or newark to brussels or paris cdg using boeing 757s from its existing fleet . in the future , openskies plans to fly to other business centers , including amsterdam , frankfurt , milan , madrid , zurich , and geneva . ba will also commence business-only flights between new york and london city airport next year using airbus a318 jets in a 32-seat layout . skyteam airline alliance 's new transatlantic flights starting between march 30 and june 2008 . • air france in joint venture with delta : daily service to los angeles • continental : twice-daily service to houston and twice-daily service to newark liberty international -lrb- ewr -rrb- from may 29 2008 • delta in joint venture with air france : daily service to atlanta and twice-daily service to new york jfk • northwest in joint venture with klm : daily service to detroit , daily service to minneapolis and daily service to seattle . slots were secured as a result of air france ditching four daily rotations from london to paris charles de gaulle and klm dropping three of its slots to northwest from eindhoven and rotterdam . non-aligned airlines . aer lingus launched services from dublin to washington dc , orlando and san francisco last year . this followed agreement between the irish and u.s. governments that the airline could begin operations before others . low-cost airline ryanair is considering setting up a separate long-haul carrier that would fly ultra-low-fares between secondary airports in europe and u.s. such as stansted and baltimore-washington international . virgin atlantic has decided to wait to see if open skies phase ii is adopted before starting new flights to new york from non-uk cities . e-mail to a friend .
690	sydney , australia -- eamon sullivan regained the 50-meter freestyle world record with a 21.41 seconds swim at the australian olympic trials in sydney . sullivan had lost his 50m freestyle record to frenchman alain bernard four days ago . he took the record back from frenchman alain bernard , who recorded 21.50 seconds at the european championships four days ago . sullivan had held the record with 21.56 , set in sydney in february . after missing out on bernard 's 100m record late on wednesday , sullivan said he hoped to improve his 50m time in friday 's final . `` i came in a bit more relaxed tonight , having got the 100m final out of the way last night and getting into the team for beijing . `` it 's sweet to get the record back off alain after missing out on the 100m world record last night and after he broke the 50m record so quickly after i did it . `` i know i have another swim left so there 's always another chance . i hope i can go faster in the final , but i like to think i can take a couple of a hundredths of a second leading into a final , so we 'll see . '' sullivan missed bernard 's 100m world record by just two-hundredths of a second in qualifying in 47.52 seconds for the olympics . libby trickett broke the women 's 100m freestyle world record with a 52.88 seconds swim . trickett , formerly libby lenton and competing for the first time under her married name , beat the 53.30 mark set by germany 's britta steffen in budapest on august 2 , 2006 . it is the second time trickett has broken the 53-second barrier , but her previous time of 52.99 at the duel in the pool in sydney last year was not ratified by fina because she was swimming against american superstar michael phelps . `` i ca n't tell you how much i wanted to break that record ever since doing it in the duel in the pool in april last year . i just wanted it so badly , '' trickett said . `` to see it officially up there on the scoreboard is just amazing . all my events are very important to me , but the 100m freestyle holds a special place in my heart and to know that four years ago i was going 0.8 seconds off , that is just awesome .

692	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- in the words of vice president john nance garner , the vice presidency `` is n't worth a pitcher of warm piss . '' vice president aaron burr is best known for shooting and killing alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 . that may be true , but the characters who 've held the job are definitely worth a few good pages of trivia . join mental_floss in toasting seven backup plans that made this country great . 1 . chester arthur : james garfield 's v.p. chester arthur took office under the thickest cloud of suspicion . as a lieutenant in senator roscoe conkling 's political machine , arthur held one of the most lucrative positions in government : collector for the port of new york . for seven years , arthur raked in approximately $ 40,000 annually -lrb- about $ 700,000 today -rrb- , running a corrupt spoils system for thousands of payroll employees . with so much money and power , arthur developed an affinity for fancy clothes and earned the nickname `` the gentleman boss . '' but his luck did n't last . president rutherford hayes eventually stepped in and fired him from the post . even with the kickback scandal and claims that he 'd been born in canada -lrb- which should 've disqualified him for the vice presidency -rrb- , arthur still managed to get elected on james garfield 's 1880 ticket . after garfield passed away 199 days into his presidency , arthur did n't hesitate to sign the pendleton civil service reform act . much to the chagrin of conkling , the act revamped civil service by effectively killing the same patronage system that made arthur very , very rich . in cleaning up civil service , arthur also cleaned up his reputation , and he exited the white house a hero . 2 . henry wallace : franklin roosevelt 's second v.p. henry wallace was a dedicated devotee of eastern mysticism . while serving as u.s. secretary of agriculture in the 1930s , he allegedly sent his guru to mongolia under the pretense of collecting grasses that could withstand drought . in reality , wallace was diverting funds to help his guru hunt for evidence that christ had visited asia . but it was n't wallace 's spiritual beliefs that landed him america 's no. 2 job . wallace was a big franklin roosevelt fan and supported his entire platform , which is why roosevelt handpicked him as his third-term running mate in 1940 . wallace was n't popular with the democratic party , but when roosevelt made it clear he would n't run without him , the party acquiesced . as vice president , wallace made many international goodwill trips . most famously , he traveled to the soviet union , where he experienced a political transformation that resulted in him becoming an avowed soviet apologist . his communist leanings did nothing for his image , especially once he became secretary of commerce under president truman . in 1948 , wallace unsuccessfully ran for president on the progressive party ticket , espousing views that sounded shockingly marxist . he even described corporations as `` midget hitlers '' attempting to crush the labor class . but nobody can say wallace did n't know how to own up to his mistakes . in 1952 , he recanted his support of the soviet union in a magazine article called `` where i was wrong . '' by then , however , his political career was over . wallace spent the rest of his life conducting agricultural experiments on his farm in new york . 3 . william rufus de vane king : franklin pierce 's v.p. william r. king was sworn into office in cuba , becoming the only executive officer to take the oath on foreign soil . king had gone to cuba to recuperate from tuberculosis and severe alcoholism , but it did n't work . he died in 1853 after being vice president for just 25 days . that might not be the most memorable thing about king , though . it 's widely rumored that the former v.p. was homosexual . further still , he 's suspected of being james buchanan 's lover . neither king nor buchanan ever married , and they lived together in washington for 15 years before buchanan became president . of course , king 's predilection for wearing scarves and wigs only fanned the rumors . president andrew jackson used to call him `` miss nancy , '' and aaron brown , a fellow southern democrat , dubbed him `` aunt fancy . '' 4 . richard m. johnson : martin van buren 's v.p. despite his credentials as a war hero and a kentucky senator , vice president richard m. johnson was never accepted in washington . perhaps that 's because he dressed like a farmhand , cursed like a sailor , and made no secret of his three black mistresses , who were also his slaves . the first mistress bore him two daughters before she passed away ; the second tried to run off with a native american chief , but johnson captured and resold her ; and the third was the second one 's sister . johnson attempted to introduce this third mistress into polite society , but the couple was n't well-received . with the support of andrew jackson , johnson landed the vice presidency under martin van buren in 1836 . after four years of public relations disasters , jackson withdrew his support . nonetheless , van buren kept johnson on his ticket , and the two lost their re-election bid in 1840 . 5 . aaron burr : thomas jefferson 's v.p. no story on vice presidents would be complete without aaron burr -- best known for shooting and killing alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 . after the incident , burr went back to presiding over the senate . from there , he plotted a treasonous conspiracy to become emperor of the western united states and mexico . the plan could have worked , but one of burr 's co-conspirators ratted him out . he was tried in 1807 before the supreme court , which found him not guilty , mainly because he had n't actually committed the treason yet . a free man , burr turned his sights on florida . he went to france and tried to convince napoleon bonaparte to help him conquer the swampland , but that plan foundered , too . although his political high jinks often failed , burr consistently found success with the ladies . after his wife died in 1794 , burr remained a bachelor for 40 years , making the acquaintance of several eligible socialites . he enjoyed flirtations with philadelphia debutantes , as well as a widow named dolley payne todd -- later known as dolley madison , wife of james madison . at age 76 , burr married a wealthy widow of ill-repute and plundered her fortune . citing numerous infidelities on his part , she filed for divorce and was actually granted it . unfortunately for her , it came through on the day burr died . 6 . andrew johnson : abraham lincoln 's 4th v.p. andrew johnson took his 1865 vice-presidential oath drunk as a skunk and belligerent as hell . having grown up dirt poor , johnson felt the aristocracy in washington had abused his kinfolk . glassy-eyed and smelling of whiskey , he reminded congress , the supreme court , the cabinet , and pretty much everyone within hearing distance that they owed their positions to `` plebeians '' such as himself , then kissed the bible and staggered away . needless to say , his address was poorly received . the new york world opined , `` to think that one frail life stands between this insolent , clownish creature and the presidency ! may god bless and spare abraham lincoln ! '' unfortunately , god did n't . the south surrendered six days before lincoln 's assassination , leaving johnson to handle reconstruction -- a job he bungled so completely that congress moved to impeach him . incredibly , johnson avoided being booted out of office by just one vote . 7 . john cabell breckenridge : james buchanan 's v.p. by all accounts , john c. breckenridge was a kentucky gentleman in the grandest sense . he had an impressive career as a lawyer and a representative in the kentucky house . more notably , at age 36 , he became the youngest vice president in history . but , like aaron burr , things took a turn for breckenridge when he was charged with treason . in september 1861 , only a few months after his vice presidential term had ended , union and confederate forces invaded his home state of kentucky . breckenridge cast his lot with the confederates , and the federal government promptly indicted him . breckenridge headed south and became jefferson davis ' secretary of war . but when the confederacy surrendered in 1865 , breckenridge was forced to go on the lam . he hid for the next two months in georgia and florida before escaping to cuba . breckinridge , his wife , and their children spent the next four years in exile , wandering through canada , england , europe , and the middle east , until president andrew johnson issued a general amnesty proclamation on christmas in 1868 . the following march , breckenridge returned to the country with his family , but his name was n't officially cleared until 1958 , when a kentucky circuit court judge dismissed his indictment . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

'' in june he won the classical ballet prize at the eurovision young dancer of the year competition held in paris . kumakawa experienced a meteoric rise through the ranks of the rbc . he quickly became a soloist , dancing the act 1 pas de trois in tchaikovsky 's ` swan lake ' and completed a memorable performance as the bronze idol in la bayadère -- a cameo role that showcased his extraordinary jumping ability . the following season he was chosen for the role of the fool in the premiere of kenneth macmillan 's ` the prince and the pagodas ' . in 1991 he was promoted to first soloist and was a principal dancer by 1993 . so developed a mutual love affair between kumakawa , his new fans and his adoptive city . `` i was so pleased to participate in british culture , '' he told the japan times in 2004 . by the age of 26 ` teddy ' , as he had become known to his friends in the uk -- ` kuma ' means ` bear ' in japanese -- had danced the full repertoire of classical and modern roles at the rbc . the man who had wowed london audiences with his acrobatic jumps and audacious turns was about to leap into a new chapter of his life . in 1998 he left the royal ballet to found his own company -- the k-ballet -- back home in tokyo . it was a highly controversial move at the time . not only had he upped sticks in the middle of a season , he also took five of the royal ballet 's star male performers with him to japan . the british press and the ballet fraternity were not impressed . greeted as a returning hero in his native country , kumakawa took on the roles of leading dancer , teacher , artistic director and company manager simultaneously . but despite the formidable workload and responsibility the new k-ballet flourished , fostering a wider interest in japanese ballet . in 2004 , kumakawa established the k-ballet school . the same year , the k-ballet became the first japanese ballet company to perform at the metropolitan opera house in new york . a career-threatening knee injury , suffered whilst on a k-ballet tour of japan in may 2007 has temporarily sidelined kumakawa from performing . but he expects to be back on stage next year , delighting audiences with virtuoso performances once again . in the meantime , kumakawa -- who continues to enjoy pop star status in japan -- continues to pass on his expertise to a new generation of dancers . e-mail to a friend .

698	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the 19-year-old woman whose hospitalization exposed a shocking austrian incest case is recovering well and wants to see the ocean and a pop concert , her doctors and a family lawyer said wednesday . dr. albert reiter , who treated kerstin , is confident kerstin will make a full recovery in time . she and other children who were held captive for years are slowly adapting to modern life , they said . kerstin fritzl , whom doctors placed in an artificial coma after she was admitted to a hospital in april for multiple organ failure , is now well enough to speak , stand and walk with assistance , her doctors said . doctors said that `` little novelties '' such as seeing a cloud go by are now big events for the former captives . kerstin has said she wants to see the ocean and go to a concert by british singer robbie williams , said dr. berhold kepplinger , director of the clinic where the family is living . he described how excited kerstin was to hear robbie williams songs in her hospital room and said she was moving around to the music so much that doctors had to quiet her down . it was then , kepplinger said , that doctors became confident kerstin can become fully healthy and develop normally . her immune system has improved , and she is continuing to have physiotherapy , including strengthening exercises , he said . watch doctors describe what happened when the teen opened her eyes '' the two parts of her family -- those who were locked in a basement , like kerstin , and those who lived above ground , apparently unaware of the abuse of their mother and siblings -- are getting to know each other again , the doctors and the family 's lawyer said . `` we are so glad that things have turned out so positively so far , '' said lawyer christoph herbst , who appeared at a news conference at a hotel near amstetten , west of vienna , where kerstin and her family are recovering . kerstin is the oldest daughter of an incestuous relationship between elisabeth , 43 , and elisabeth 's father , josef fritzl , 73 , according to police . he is awaiting trial . police say he confessed to holding elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly , fathering seven children with her . six of the children survived . kerstin fell unconscious in april , and elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention . kerstin was admitted to a hospital in amstetten , where staff grew suspicious and called police , who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse . kerstin was suffering from kidney , lung , and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital , said dr. albert reiter , director of the hospital . doctors were able to turn her health around , but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks , he said . doctors started reducing kerstin 's medication may 12 , allowing her to emerge from the coma , he said . three days later , she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers , he said , and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat . her mother was at kerstin 's bedside regularly , and doctors credited that with helping kerstin 's health improve . on sunday , kerstin finally met with other family members and was able to say hello to them , he said . kerstin and the rest of the family were also able to move into an apartment at a regional clinic nearby . `` it was a special moment where , walking , we were able to support her and cross the threshold into a new house and into a new life , '' reiter said . kerstin and two of her brothers , ages 18 and 5 , had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother , never seeing daylight . a television was their only contact with the outside world . the other three children josef fritzl fathered with elisabeth were taken as infants to live above ground with fritzl and his wife , who says she had no idea her daughter was being held captive . in recent weeks , the wife and the three children have had several meetings with kerstin and the others formerly held in the basement . the doctors said that all are receiving therapy and are getting to know each other . `` it is clear that -lsb- the two sides -rsb- have a different temper of life , '' kepplinger said . `` these different ways of living , the two parts of the family , still have to come to some agreement . '' still , the entire family is `` very happy '' to be reunited , herbst said . `` this is an incredible drawing-near to each other . there is incredible joy among them , '' he said . `` it is wonderful to see the way they are living together . '' he appealed to the public and the media to give the family privacy . there continues to be `` big ambivalence '' about the `` grandfather issue , '' as kepplinger called it , and therapists are helping the family members cope with the complicated relationship they have with each other and with fritzl , who is now behind bars .

700	nairobi , kenya -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- ethnic fighting once again engulfed kenya 's western rift valley on sunday as witnesses and red cross officials reported brutal attacks by members of president mwai kibaki 's kikuyu tribe on other ethnic groups . police attempt to secure a street in naivasha , where violence flared on sunday . the violence spread to the rift valley town of naivasha on sunday , where the red cross said there were reports of people being burned alive in their homes . kenya 's main opposition party and the red cross said as many as 30 people were killed . ethnic killings continued in the nearby rift valley town of nakuru , where another 47 people have died since the latest wave of violence began on thursday , according to the opposition orange democratic movement . the opposition death toll is much higher than police figures , which do not include sunday 's violence in naivasha . police say 31 people have died in the rift valley region since last thursday . watch cnn 's zain verjee report on the violence '' in a statement released sunday , odm leader raila odinga condemned reports of 30 people being burned alive in their naivasha homes and blamed the kibaki government for fomenting the violence in the region . `` i condemn this murderous and evil act in the strongest terms possible , '' he said . `` what is now emerging is that criminal gangs , in a killing spree , working under police protection , are part of a well-orchestrated plan of terror . '' it is a dramatic turn of events , considering odinga was shaking kibaki 's hand three days ago after the two met under the auspices of former united nations secretary-general kofi annan . many had hoped thursday 's meeting , arranged by annan who is mediating peace efforts , would bring an end to the outbreak of bloody ethnic battles that followed last month 's contested presidential vote . but it seems to have had the opposite effect . odinga blamed kibaki 's government for orchestrating the rift valley violence `` to try to influence mediation efforts '' and `` to divert -lrb- attention -rrb- from election malpractice to security and violence . '' `` after stealing the elections from kenyans , kibaki now wishes to deny them justice and peace , '' odinga said . a red cross official said the agency had received reports of a non-kikuyu family burned to death in their house in naivasha . television footage showed a man in the back of a police vehicle covered in blood with a large machete wound on the side of his head . kenyan police dispersed large gangs and cleared rocks littering the streets of the lakeside town , which is dominated by kikuyu . tree branches , heavy boulders and oil drums littered the streets of naivasha 's town center as the kikuyu gangs erected temporary road blocks , cnn correspondent zain verjee reported . she said the atmosphere was tense as the gangs checked cars to identify rival tribes . verjee said there was a heavy police presence on the outskirts of the town . some shops remained open but the town center was almost deserted except for the roaming gangs . it was a similar situation in nakuru on sunday , where odm member the rev. mike brawan said members of the kikuyu tribe `` are flushing out the non-kikuyus from their houses .

701	in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . keith oppenheim is covering the controversy in irving , texas over authorities ' efforts to find illegal immigrants . irving , texas -- i certainly do n't think i look like a cop . with a blue blazer , and scruffy khakis i take into the field , i have that look of a reporter who 's trying to dress up just enough to be professional , but no more . protesters in irving , texas , demonstrate against a program that checks the immigration status of anyone arrested . so , it came as a surprise to me when i learned some latino men , day laborers who were standing around and hoping to get some work , thought i was a federal immigration officer . `` you thought i was from immigration ? '' i asked one . `` si '' , the man replied . my producer , patricia pedraza , translated the rest . `` the fear is with both immigration and the police . now you can not trust absolutely anybody . '' in irving , texas , a dallas suburb of about 200,000 people , right next to the big airport , an estimated 40 percent of the city is latino , and anecdotally , we 're told there are a lot of undocumented workers here , people who are in the u.s. illegally , but clearly do n't view themselves as criminals . `` they take innocent people , they think we 're all the same , '' another undocumented worker told me . the fear is a reaction to what 's called the criminal alien program . since september of last year , irving police started to refer anyone arrested in their community to federal authorities , who check their immigration status . `` it 's only for people who have violated texas laws , and are arrested and brought into the irving jail , '' said larry boyd , irving 's police chief . as a result , referrals for deportations have shot up to 1,600 , more than 40 times the number from the year before . statistics from police show that while some of those referrals were for people who committed serious crimes , the majority were a result of misdemeanors and traffic warrants . many sources told me that a growing number of latinos here are afraid to drive . the risk is being caught with a suspended license , going to jail and getting deported . see the effect the program has had on irving '' but if some in the latino community are lying low , advocates for immigrants are speaking out -- accusing the city and police of targeting latinos without cause . `` we believe the criminal alien program is fundamentally wrong , '' says carlos quintanilla , an activist . `` that there is racial profiling going on . '' the city 's mayor , herbert gears , disagrees . he says police are not taking on the role of immigration officers . `` we will make sure people are being treated fairly , '' he said . `` that people are n't being pulled over because of the color of their skin . '' as i spent more time in irving , i came to realize that outside the large latino community , there is broad support for the program . `` you have to start somewhere , '' said sheik shah , an irving resident who emigrated to the u.s. from india and is now an american citizen . `` because right now , we have so many loopholes for people to come in here and work illegally . '' some were more direct . i read from two tall stacks of printed e-mail addressed to the city council , which were overwhelmingly supported the criminal alien program . one read : `` please help deport all illegals . what part of illegal do they not understand ? '' another : `` thank god some people are doing something about this invasion . '' in the end , irving is in the middle of a profound disagreement , between those who feel it 's wrong to refer people to immigration authorities for nonviolent crimes and misdemeanors , and those who believe illegal immigration has gone too far -- that something has to be done . as irving city council member beth van duyne told me : `` we need to know who is in our city . if you 're committing a crime , we need to know who you are . i do n't think that 's too much to ask .

705	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- turkey snatched a last-gasp winner to eliminate euro 2008 co-hosts switzerland and keep their own quarterfinal hopes alive with a 2-1 victory in rain-drenched basel on wednesday night . patrick mueller , left , and swiss goalkeeper diego benaglio battle for the ball with arda turan of turkey . arda turan scored with a deflected effort in the third minute of time added on to set up a group a finale against the czech republic on sunday to determine who takes the second quarterfinal place behind portugal . the turks came from behind after hakan yakin gave the swiss a 32nd-minute lead , with substitute striker semih senturk heading a 57th-minute equalizer through the hands of goalkeeper diego benaglio . the st jakob park stadium had been flooded by a deluge early in the match , with the downpour continuing until just before half-time . the treacherous conditions made defending a nightmare for both teams , and arda almost put turkey ahead in the 29th minute with a farcical effort . with minimal visibility in the heavy rain , benaglio punched a vicious free-kick by stand-in captain nihat kahveci onto the head of the 21-year-old winger -- but the ball bounced to safety off the outside of the post . however , it was the swiss who adapted the better and they took the lead through the veteran yakin . he was on hand to awkwardly steer home from close range with his weaker right foot after eren derdiyok -- who like yakin is of turkish origin -- beat the offside trap to collect a long pass from defender philippe senderos . derdiyok calmly check inside the defense in the penalty area and sent a low cross towards yakin -- who had to wait anxiously at the far post as the ball was held up in a huge puddle of water . yakin had earlier been denied by turkey goalkeeper volkan demirel , who also did well to tip a swerving free-kick by tranquillo barnetta around the post . yakin also missed an even easier chance than the goal he scored in the 34th minute when he stabbed the ball wide of the post following a superb right-wing cross by valon behrami which cut out the defense and goal custodian . turkey , sensing a lucky escape , came out after the break with renewed purpose and posed a greater threat as the pitch slowly drained of the excess water . semih justified his second-half introduction when he rose highest to meet nihat 's superb inswinging cross from the left flank , and benaglio could only palm the powerful header into the back of the net . tempers flared as both sides went in search of the victory , but there was no repeat of the violent scenes that followed switzerland 's world cup playoff victory against the turks in november 2005 . volkan made another superb save from yakin , and turkey held off the swiss onslaught before arda cut in from the right and fired a shot from just outside the penalty area which clipped the heels of patrick mueller and looped over the helpless benaglio . `` i did wish for rain to stop . i did pray to god for that , '' turkey coach fatih terim told reporters . `` we could n't predict mud in the middle of the summer . `` it 's not easy to come back from a goal down at the european championship , considering we hit the woodwork once . but we fought a lot in the second half and we created many opportunities . '' he added : `` tonight we reminded everyone a little bit about turkey . against the czech republic , we will be unforgettable . '' defeat was a bitter blow for switzerland , whose fellow co-hosts austria will also be eliminated on thursday if they lose to poland in vienna . `` of course the disappointment is huge , '' switzerland coach koebi kuhn said . `` but i ca n't blame it on any player or anyone else . we lost twice unluckily .

706	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it 's been five years since carrie bradshaw journeyed to paris in search of true love on the series finale of `` sex and the city . '' she appeared to have found it in the arms of mr. big , and she returned to new york -- and her now-settled friends -- ready for a new start . sarah jessica parker was a driving force in creating the `` sex and the city '' movie . then came the inevitable cry : that 's it ? what happens next ? sarah jessica parker , who played carrie , wanted to find out as well . but the situation had to be right , she said , which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together , fell apart and came together again . now that the movie is out , parker -- who 's a producer of the film as well as one of its stars -- talked about the journey to making a big-screen `` sex and the city '' with `` showbiz tonight '' anchor a.j. hammer . the following is an edited version of that interview . cnn : i think a lot of fans , maybe a lot of people , and those of you among the cast , did n't think this day would actually ever come ... but here we are . so how are you feeling deep inside , sarah ? sarah jessica parker : i feel extraordinarily privileged . i 've spent the last two years cobbling this movie together . ... it 's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of professional experience and one really should n't be greedy enough to ask for it twice . watch the cast talk about the thrill of `` sex '' '' i have to say that , this last six , eight months , was better than those seven years -lsb- the show aired -rsb- and i think it 's because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you do n't get to tell twice . it has been , i must say , worth every obstacle and dead end , and fit and start , and every moment that was seemingly impossible . it has been a dream . cnn : and i imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read , which was , from my understanding , the first time you all actually were in the same room -lsb- together -rsb- regardless of how much you kept in touch . tell me a little bit about that moment . parker : i started putting -lsb- the -rsb- script back together in april of 2006 ... and that -lsb- table read -rsb- was a really extraordinary day , because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated . kim -lsb- cattrall -rsb- had been away and kristin -lsb- davis -rsb- had been away and chris -lsb- noth -rsb- had been -lsb- doing -rsb- his other job , and this magnificent script had arrived and had been everything we hoped for and more . it was basically like being in an alternate universe for about three hours . ... it was a kind of reunion that is very , very special , because you really want to be there . it 's not the reunion where you 're forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely . it 's the reunion that you want . i think even more so was that first day on -lsb- the -rsb- set . when we thought , good god , -lsb- writer/director -rsb- michael patrick -lsb- king -rsb- and i are actually making this movie , like we got it done , we 're here , we 're doing it -- what a privilege . cnn : i think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on `` oprah , '' because the energy was ... palpable . ... but we 're talking about the perceived drama around this whole project . -lrb- rumors have abounded about friction between the stars . -rrb- one of my producers said while we were watching the tv , `` are they going to sit near each other ? '' `` why are they putting chris in the middle of all of them ? '' hearing that , does it make you mad ? parker : i find it slightly -- it 's not that i 'm mad . i expect better from people . i think it 's really beneath me , to keep defending myself . i have a 35-year career . i have an impeccable character , i really pride myself in my work ethic and the way i treat people . and i think kim would say the same and cynthia would say the same . and i love kim , and i wanted her to be in this movie . we could n't have done it without her , we could n't have done it without kristin , we could n't have done it without cynthia -lsb- nixon -rsb- , nor could we have done it without chris . watch cattrall address the rumors '' you know , this is a story that people like to tell about women . why ? i do n't know . is it that interesting ? probably not . so once again i just have to say it does n't define the experience . nobody can take the experience away . it 's far more interesting for me to talk about my affection for this cast than to start to deny a sad old beaten tale . cnn : you seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective -- and you have to , being at the game as long as you 've been . to that end , one of the things that i 've always admired about you and -lsb- husband -rsb- matthew -lsb- broderick -rsb- and i think a lot of people do , is how you 've managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight . ... now i know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you do n't talk about your private lives , which is great and i applaud that . that said , is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that ? parker : i would n't make any proclamations about why i have a marriage that , to me , is successful . i would just say that we 've chosen to live in a city where we are not the most interesting people . this is a city that is about industry and finance and publishing and architecture and the arts and education and academia , and the movie industry fits into it in some small way , but there are a lot of people of important interest and i think that it 's a conscious choice to live in a place where we 're bumping up against humanity . we run to the market on our own , we take the subway , and we integrate into our city , and we become a part of the fabric and i think it 's really been to our benefit and certainly to our son . does it mean that we are not scrutinized and that we do n't have paparazzi every single day at our house ? no , but it is a city where you ca n't live behind a gate , you ca n't drive up in a car and be protected . you walk out the door and it is what it is . so you reconcile those things and you make the best choices you can . cnn : is it the end of `` sex and the city '' ? what does your gut tell you ? parker : my gut tells me it 's up to you and your colleagues and the critics and the people who show up . the future is dictated not by us at this point , and i think michael patrick and i have been so focused at getting this movie up on the big screen , that we have n't thought about the future . doing this was more than we could have asked for . so anything beyond that is really kind of out of our hands in a perfectly wonderful way .
707	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- croatia sent out a message of intent to the other euro 2008 finalists as they stunned highly-fancied germany 2-1 in klagenfurt to secure a place in the quarterfinals . ivicia olic celebrates croatia 's second goal in their superb 2-1 victory over germany . darijo srna and ivica olic struck the goals as croatia , who had only ever beaten germany once before , produced arguably the first major upset of the tournament . lukas podolski pulled a goal back late on for germany with his third strike in two games to set up a nail-biting finale , but there was to be no way back for joachim loew 's team , who finished with 10 men following the 90th-minute dismissal of substitute bastian schweinsteiger . both sides came into the game having won their opening matches , although germany had looked far more impressive in seeing off poland than croatia had in defeating austria . however , it was slaven bilic 's side who turned on the style at the worthersee stadion as they took control of group b with two wins out of two . a frantic start to the match promised much but for all their huffing and puffing , neither side were able to create anything resembling a chance in the opening 20 minutes as defences held firm . the ball did find its way into the back of the net in the 22nd minute when germany striker mario gomez slotted home past stipe pletikosa but the offside flag had already gone up against the stuttgart man . the deadlock was broken for real just two minutes after that incident though , when croatia went ahead through srna . danijel pranjic sent over a superb cross from the left and srna nipped in front of marker marcell jansen to slide the ball in at the far post , giving veteran germany goalkeeper jens lehmann no chance . croatia had a gilt-edged chance to make it 2-0 in the 30th minute , but niko kranjcar wasted it . ivan rakitic chipped a pass into the area which was flicked back towards the penalty spot by olic , but the in-rushing kranjcar was unable to cap a well-worked move as he blazed over . germany knew they needed to step up through the gears and they finally made pletikosa earn his keep with two efforts in rapid succession . the first saw pletikosa push away a thunderous michael ballack free-kick , before the spartak moscow custodian awkwardly deflected away a christoph metzelder effort with his knee . metzelder then headed a torsten frings corner just over from close range as the germans stepped up their efforts for an equalizer before the break . however , loew 's side very nearly found themselves two goals behind in the 43rd minute , and they needed a fine reaction stop from lehmann to deny kranjcar , who chested down olic 's pass and smashed in a first-time volley . having seen his side let off the hook , loew opted for a more adventurous approach in the second half as he sacrificed full-back jansen for jet-heeled winger david odonkor during the interval . aside from a ballack shot over the crossbar though , croatia looked fairly comfortable at the start of the period and also had a decent effort of their own with luka modric firing in a shot that lehmann gathered , although not before seeing it squirm through his hands first . however , lehmann 's next task was to pick the ball out of the back of his net as croatia stunned the germans with a second goal in the 62nd minute . a rakitic cross from the right took a deflection off podolski before arrowing goalwards and although lehmann , who had begun to come out for the initial cross , managed to dive backwards and get a hand on it , the ball struck his near post before rebounding back out to olic , who had the easy task of slotting home . germany looked for an immediate response but aside from a schweinsteiger shot that fizzed across the face of goal , they were still finding it difficult to create chances against a well-organised croatia backline . loew 's side earned themselves a lifeline with 12 minutes to go though when podolski lashed home a shot on the half-volley after the ball had fallen kindly to him in the box . germany could not build on that goal , though , and their final hopes of getting anything out of the match all but disappeared when schweinsteiger was given a straight red card for shoving jerko leko in the final minute of an absorbing encounter . `` i want to especially congratulate my players , not only for the fight they showed but for playing an excellent match , '' said a delighted bilic . `` there is no other way to beat the germans than to play well . they 're still a great team , though , and still one of the favorites for the title .

708	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- starting a legitimate business is hard , boring work . there 's paperwork to fill out , employees to hire , and all sorts of other drudgery , not to mention the biggest hurdle of all : providing a product or service for which customers are willing to pay . president ulysses s. grant foiled a gold scam . in all likelihood , it would be much easier to just stumble upon some clever scam to line your pockets . or so it would seem . as many aspiring scam artists quickly learn , when a business scam fails , it tends to fail in rather grand fashion . just ask any of these four teams of not-so-smooth operators . a corny sea story . xenothemis and hegestratos may not have been the world 's first white-collar criminals , but they were certainly noteworthy for their incompetence . in 360 b.c. , the pair stumbled upon what seemed like a killer plan to make some quick cash . shipping was extremely risky at the time , and boats went down at sea with alarming frequency . to exploit this uncertainty , xenothemis and hegestratos devised a plan in which they would receive a cash advance to ship a load of corn from syracuse to athens . due to the dangers associated with shipping , the buyer would take on full risk if the shipment did n't make it to athens , so if the boat sank xenothemis and hegestratos could keep their cash . instead of loading the ship with expensive corn , the conniving pair made a plan to sail an empty ship out to sea for a few days , then sink it and escape in lifeboats . since the boat itself was insured , this plot seemed airtight , and the potential profit was great . unfortunately , though , the boat 's other passengers allegedly caught wind of the scheme during the attempting scuttling of the ship . these passengers were understandably a bit peeved at hegestratos ' attempts to drown them for his own financial gain . hegestratos panicked and jumped overboard , at which point he drowned . unable to sink the ship by himself , xenothemis had to sail on to the port , at which point the buyer , protos , wanted to know why his shipload of corn was empty . a legal battle followed , and although the verdict has been lost by history , it 's safe to say that the late hegestratos regretted the scam . when friday went black . despite his prowess as a general , ulysses s. grant 's presidency did n't go so smoothly . ones of its most notable scandals occurred in 1869 , when a group of speculators upended the u.s gold market . the plan started when financier james fisk and robber baron jay gould formed a group of speculators with the goal of cornering the gold market , which would give the group the ability to manipulate the price . of course , one can only corner the market if there 's a fixed quantity of gold available . otherwise , the government could just sell large quantities of gold , and the cornering effort would be an expensive failure . in an effort to avoid this fate , gould and fisk brought president grant 's brother-in-law abel corbin into their fold . using corbin 's influence to get an audience with the president , the pair would argue to grant that selling gold was a terrible idea that the government should avoid at all costs . the wily pair also used their influence at the white house to secure a position as assistant treasurer of the united states for daniel butterfield , who would warn them if the government started to sell gold . with their connections in place , fisk and gould started buying up gold in september 1869 , quickly driving the price of gold up by around 30 percent . once grant and his advisors got wise to the situation , though , the government quickly sold off $ 4 million in gold to break the corner , effectively killing the inflated prices on september 24 . as investors scrambled to get rid of their overpriced gold , the price plummeted sharply , and many involved in the scam lost huge amounts of money . fisk and gould managed to avoid big losses due to their connections in the treasury , but what would be known as black friday did n't earn them a huge windfall -- and significantly harmed the american economy . bad moves . if you 've ever hired movers , you know it can be pretty pricey . erik deri , the founder of woodinville , washington-based nationwide moving systems , understood that most movers were expensive , so he drummed up business by offering super-cheap quotes to frugal clients . the customers were ecstatic to find a mover who could get their belongings to a new home so cheaply . that is , until the price went up . deri 's movers would load the company 's vans with all of a customer 's worldly belongings , then a foreman would inform the client that they 'd have to pay an inflated price to actually get their stuff to their new digs . the price hikes were n't small , either ; one man 's estimate stated he could move for $ 3,000 but was later revised to $ 16,000 after loading . according to authorities , if customers balked at these demands , the movers would threaten to unload their boxes and furniture into the street ... and then charge them an unloading fee . if things got really sticky , nationwide 's trucks could just take off with all of the clients ' possessions . deri supposedly paid cash bonuses to employees who successfully strong-armed customers into forking over the premiums . in the end , though , deri learned that you ca n't scam that many customers and hope to get away with it . in 2005 he was found guilty of 27 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion . three of his accomplices were also convicted in connection with the moving racket . deri was sentenced to seven years in prison , after which he 'll face deportation to his native israel . fools for gold . bre-x minerals ltd. was a small canadian mining company that made a big announcement in 1995 . geologists had discovered gold on a site bre-x owned near busang , indonesia . not just a little gold , either -- at least 30 million ounces , possibly as much as 200 million ounces . given the high prices of gold , such a deposit would have been worth tens of billions of dollars . bre-x 's stock price shot through the roof ; shares went from being valued at a few cents to over $ 280 canadian . in fact , the deposit seemed so rich and so large that a small company like bre-x could not possibly handle it all without some help . in 1997 , the indonesian government convinced bre-x to take on an american firm as a partner to help extract the gold . when this firm , freeport-mcmoran , started sampling the soil at the deposit site as part of its due diligence , it reached a confusing conclusion : there was n't any gold in the soil . subsequent examinations by independent auditors reached the same conclusion . the `` natural '' gold that in the original samples bre-x had taken was mostly river gold from other regions or shavings off of gold jewelry . although the company 's market cap had climbed to $ 4.4 billion , this report quickly destroyed bre-x 's value . share prices dropped 97 percent in a day following the announcement , the company was soon removed from the toronto stock exchange and nasdaq , and bre-x quickly went bankrupt . amazingly , no one ended up in jail from this scam , but you should still probably be wary if anyone offers to sell you an enormous gold mine on borneo . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

710	kathmandu , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- nepal 's former king said wednesday he is not going to leave his country even though the monarchy has been abolished . gyanendra came to power in 2001 following the assassination of king birendra and his family . ex-king gyanendra , 60 , made remarks to reporters before departing the narayanhiti royal palace in kathmandu . he will live as a civilian in the former himalayan kingdom that was made a republic last month , and he will reside in a summer palace on a forested hilltop outside the capital . a few hundred journalists crammed into the opulent palace 's lobby entrance to hear gyanendra 's remarks . it was a chaotic and undeferential scene replete with pushing , shoving and scuffling -- even while the former monarch was speaking . while the former king spoke , reporters looked around at the lavish furnishings , including a huge crystal chandelier , stuffed tigers , stuffed rhino heads mounted on the walls and paintings of previous monarchs . gyanendra , who expressed his `` love '' for `` independent nepal , '' said all of his property will remain in the country and that he has no property outside the nation . `` i have no intention or thoughts to leave the country , '' he said . `` i will stay in the country to help establish peace . '' the monarchy 's end after 239 years of rule was the culmination of a two-year peace process in which maoist insurgents in nepal gave up their armed struggle , joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in april 's election for the constituent assembly . the assembly is tasked with rewriting the constitution , deciding the country 's future political system and governing the nation . gyanendra , who noted that the country is going through a `` serious '' stage now , said he accepts the new reality of a republic and reflected on the actions of the monarchy . `` i have done all i can to cooperate with -lrb- the government 's -rrb- directives , '' he said , and added that `` the monarchy in nepal has always been with the people of nepal in good times and bad times .

713	harare , zimbabwe -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe has warned that veterans he commanded in his country 's liberation war will take up arms again to prevent the opposition party from taking power . zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe says war veterans do not want the opposition in power . mugabe -- zimbabwe 's only leader since that struggle ended in 1980 -- faces a june 27 runoff with morgan tsvangirai of the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- . mugabe told supporters that tsvangirai would turn the country back over to white control if he won the runoff . the veterans he led in a successful effort against a government dominated by the white minority were not prepared to recognize a tsvangirai victory , mugabe said . `` they said they got this country through the barrel of gun , so they can not let it go by a ballot , '' mugabe said thursday at a campaign rally in murehwa . tsvangirai was arrested twice thursday . he was released friday , but police impounded his two campaign buses . in the general election on march 29 , the opposition won a plurality in parliament . weeks after the election , the zimbabwe electoral commission announced that tsvangirai won a plurality against mugabe but that he failed to get the needed majority , making a runoff necessary . human rights watch issued a report this week declaring the presidential election to be dead on arrival because of violence and intimidation by mugabe 's followers -- including war veterans - against opposition supporters . mugabe , at a rally in chikomba district -- about 120 miles -lrb- 200 km -rrb- south of harare -- seemed to support that conclusion . learn more about zimbabwe '' `` these areas , where the party lost on march 29 , need to be cleansed and i am confident this would be done on june 27 when we go to the polls .

714	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- graeme le saux played more than 400 matches for blackburn , chelsea and southampton , winning a premier league title and 36 international caps . cnn 's don riddell talks to the former england star about homophobia and racism in the game . graeme le saux , pictured here playing for chelsea , endured homophobic abuse throughout his career due to false rumors he was gay . don riddell : graeme , you 're happily married with two children but during your football career everyone thought you were gay and the experience was pretty miserable . graeme le saux : the culture of football back in the 80s was very different , something i found very hard to relate to and subsequently i found myself a little bit isolated and ostracized from certain people . that eventually led to rumors being spread that i was gay . in the context of modern life that 's not defamatory but in terms of the dressing room culture that existed then -- and to an extent now -- it was very difficult for me to deal with and had the potential to damage my career . i think that the joke very quickly got out of hand . and i think where i was at fault was that i was probably a little sensitive about it , because i could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control . and it did . we played in a game at west ham and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and i remember being , you know , really , really shocked that it got to that level so quickly . dr : and that carried on as well and the most notable incident is the one involving robbie fowler . tell me about that ? gs : it all culminated in a game that we played at stamford bridge against liverpool and robbie fowler , he stood in front of 40,000 people and he bent over and invited me to perform a homosexual act upon him ... that 's the politest way i can put it ! that really was the point at which it could n't get any worse . it was n't just people singing on the terrace , it was a colleague -- an international colleague -- humiliating you in front of all those people , an international audience . he will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point . if you look at anything like this , whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever , as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue . i 'm all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you ca n't hide behind that as an excuse . dr : it 's thought that only one professional soccer player in the world has ever declared himself to be gay . that was the englishman justin fashanu and he committed suicide a decade ago . john amaechi became the first gay player to be associated with the nba last year , but such declarations are extremely rare . in many cases homosexuality remains pro sport 's last taboo . gs : it 's such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport . if you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics , across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still is n't and i find that disappointing . there may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment . dr : football 's obviously made great strides , certainly in britain , in the last 10 years with regards to racism , but how much prejudice is there generally in the game ? do you think we 'll ever be free of it ? gs : i think there 's always going to be an undercurrent of prejudice . but ultimately i think it 's important for any business really to be responsible , inclusive and representative of its employees . and football is in a very privileged position and can lead by example . and so i hope that , you know , the people in authority really make some serious attempts , i suppose to create parity between all walks of life . dr : we 've come across a couple of black footballers who say that fans who shout racist abuse are n't really racist , they are just trying to put us off our game . how much do you buy into that approach ? gs : well , i ca n't speak for individual black players ! but sometimes i think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual . it used to baffle me when i first started playing that you 'd have chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the chelsea 's team . and if you spoke to them or confronted them about it , they would be like , `` oh yeah , but we know them ... they are , you know , they are fine . '' and it 's like , well how do you pick the bones out of that ? because there is just no logic . but then you know prejudice is built on ignorance . you know it really is . i think that sometimes you know individuals have to take responsibility for themselves and actually take a step back and look at what they are doing and not use ignorance as an excuse and say , `` well , would i like to be on the receiving end of this sort of abuse ? ''

718	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the 19-year-old woman whose hospitalization exposed a shocking austrian incest case is recovering well and wants to see the ocean and a pop concert , her doctors and a family lawyer said wednesday . dr. albert reiter , who treated kerstin , is confident kerstin will make a full recovery in time . she and other children who were held captive for years are slowly adapting to modern life , they said . kerstin fritzl , whom doctors placed in an artificial coma after she was admitted to a hospital in april for multiple organ failure , is now well enough to speak , stand and walk with assistance , her doctors said . doctors said that `` little novelties '' such as seeing a cloud go by are now big events for the former captives . kerstin has said she wants to see the ocean and go to a concert by british singer robbie williams , said dr. berhold kepplinger , director of the clinic where the family is living . he described how excited kerstin was to hear robbie williams songs in her hospital room and said she was moving around to the music so much that doctors had to quiet her down . it was then , kepplinger said , that doctors became confident kerstin can become fully healthy and develop normally . her immune system has improved , and she is continuing to have physiotherapy , including strengthening exercises , he said . watch doctors describe what happened when the teen opened her eyes '' the two parts of her family -- those who were locked in a basement , like kerstin , and those who lived above ground , apparently unaware of the abuse of their mother and siblings -- are getting to know each other again , the doctors and the family 's lawyer said . `` we are so glad that things have turned out so positively so far , '' said lawyer christoph herbst , who appeared at a news conference at a hotel near amstetten , west of vienna , where kerstin and her family are recovering . kerstin is the oldest daughter of an incestuous relationship between elisabeth , 43 , and elisabeth 's father , josef fritzl , 73 , according to police . he is awaiting trial . police say he confessed to holding elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly , fathering seven children with her . six of the children survived . kerstin fell unconscious in april , and elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention . kerstin was admitted to a hospital in amstetten , where staff grew suspicious and called police , who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse . kerstin was suffering from kidney , lung , and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital , said dr. albert reiter , director of the hospital . doctors were able to turn her health around , but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks , he said . doctors started reducing kerstin 's medication may 12 , allowing her to emerge from the coma , he said . three days later , she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers , he said , and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat . her mother was at kerstin 's bedside regularly , and doctors credited that with helping kerstin 's health improve . on sunday , kerstin finally met with other family members and was able to say hello to them , he said . kerstin and the rest of the family were also able to move into an apartment at a regional clinic nearby . `` it was a special moment where , walking , we were able to support her and cross the threshold into a new house and into a new life , '' reiter said . kerstin and two of her brothers , ages 18 and 5 , had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother , never seeing daylight . a television was their only contact with the outside world . the other three children josef fritzl fathered with elisabeth were taken as infants to live above ground with fritzl and his wife , who says she had no idea her daughter was being held captive . in recent weeks , the wife and the three children have had several meetings with kerstin and the others formerly held in the basement . the doctors said that all are receiving therapy and are getting to know each other . `` it is clear that -lsb- the two sides -rsb- have a different temper of life , '' kepplinger said . `` these different ways of living , the two parts of the family , still have to come to some agreement . '' still , the entire family is `` very happy '' to be reunited , herbst said . `` this is an incredible drawing-near to each other . there is incredible joy among them , '' he said . `` it is wonderful to see the way they are living together . '' he appealed to the public and the media to give the family privacy . there continues to be `` big ambivalence '' about the `` grandfather issue , '' as kepplinger called it , and therapists are helping the family members cope with the complicated relationship they have with each other and with fritzl , who is now behind bars .

'' hamas senior official mahmoud zahar and hamas negotiator khalil al-hayya announced the egyptian-brokered agreement at a news conference in gaza . they said it will begin at 6 a.m. thursday -lrb- 11 p.m. wednesday et -rrb- . on sunday , israel gradually will start to open its border crossing terminals , the hamas officials said . asked about initial reports of a cease-fire , one israeli official would not confirm whether an agreement had been finalized but said any truce would involve a sequential process . watch what truce may mean in gaza '' the official said israel would reopen some of its terminals along the gaza border after calm had been established . he said israel is still calling for the release of cpl. gilad shalit as part of a broader cease-fire . gaza militants kidnapped shalit in june 2006 . egypt has been trying to broker a truce between hamas and israel for months . militants in hamas-controlled gaza have pummeled israel with thousands of rocket and mortar attacks , prompting israeli military operations in the palestinian territory . referring to the egyptian mediation efforts , barak said , `` it 's important to exhaust the possibility . `` the idf -lsb- israel defense forces -rsb- is prepared for any developments , but it is important to attempt to achieve a period of calm to bring back the peace and quiet for the -lsb- israeli -rsb- people who live around gaza in sderot and ashkelon and to try and renew negotiations for the release of gilad shalit . '' militants in gaza have launched more than 2,300 mortars and rockets since the start of 2008 , more than the 2,000 launched in all of last year , according to israeli military figures . while most of the attacks do not result in casualties , three israelis have been killed in rocket and mortar strikes in recent weeks . the israeli military responds to the attacks by carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in gaza that target militants , but many times lead to civilian casualties -- further inflaming the palestinian leadership . israel also has restricted supplies of gasoline , diesel and electricity to gaza , limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in gaza to export anything to the outside world . hamas seized control of gaza last year after routing palestinian security agencies under the control of palestinian president mahmoud abbas and his fatah movement . the ouster forced abbas to dissolve the fatah-hamas unity government , but fatah still controls the west bank . representatives from the rival factions met recently in senegal for talks aimed at restoring the political and territorial split . earlier this month , abbas called for `` national unity '' talks with hamas with the goal of producing new elections for the palestinians , who elected a hamas-led palestinian authority government in a u.s.-backed vote in 2006 . meanwhile , abbas ' western-backed government is working toward a peace agreement with israel . the bush administration has said it wants the two sides to reach an agreement by the end of the year . cnn 's shira medding contributed to this report .
726	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former terrorist suspects detained by the united states were tortured , according to medical examinations detailed in a report released wednesday by a human rights group . a u.s. serviceman with his dog watches a detainee at abu ghraib prison in iraq in 2003 . the massachusetts-based physicians for human rights reached that conclusion after two-day clinical evaluations of 11 former detainees , who had been held at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , at guantanamo bay , cuba , and in afghanistan . the detainees were never charged with crimes . `` we found clear physical and psychological evidence of torture and abuse , often causing lasting suffering , '' said dr. allen keller , a medical evaluator for the study . in a 121-page report , the doctors ' group said that it uncovered medical evidence of torture , including beatings , electric shock , sleep deprivation , sexual humiliation , sodomy and scores of other abuses . the report is prefaced by retired u.s. major gen. antonio taguba , who led the army 's investigation into the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in 2003 . watch why a rights group says there 's evidence of torture '' `` there is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes , '' taguba says . `` the only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account . '' over the years , reports of abuses at abu ghraib and allegations of torture at guantanamo prompted the bush administration to deny that the u.s. military tortures detainees . since only 11 detainees were examined `` the findings of this assessment can not be generalized to the treatment of all detainees in u.s. custody , '' the report says . however , the incidents documented are consistent with findings of other investigations into government treatment , `` making it reasonable to conclude that these detainees were not the only ones abused , but are representative of a much larger number of detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment while in u.s. custody . '' four of the men evaluated were arrested in or taken to afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 and later were sent to guantanamo bay , where they were held for an average of three years before being released without charge , the report says . the other seven were detained in iraq in 2003 and released within a year , the report says . all the subjects told examiners that they were subjected to multiple forms of torture or ill treatment that `` often occurred in combination over a long period of time , '' the report says . while the report presents synopses of the detainees ' backgrounds based on interviews with them , the authors did not have access to the detainees ' medical histories . therefore , there 's no way to know whether any of the inmates may have had medical or mental problems before being detained . among the ex-detainees was an iraqi in his mid-40s , identified only as laith , whom u.s. soldiers took into custody in october 2003 and who was released from abu ghraib in june 2004 . according to the report , laith was subjected to sleep deprivation , electric shocks and threats of sexual abuse to himself and his family . `` they took off even my underwear . they asked me to do some movements that make me look in a very bad way so they can take photographs . ... they were trying to make me look like an animal , '' laith told examiners , according to the report . according to the report , laith said the most `` painful '' experiences involved threats to his family : `` and they asked me , ` have you ever heard voices of women in this prison ? ' i answered , ` yes . ' they were saying , ` then you will hear your mothers and sisters when we are raping them . ' '' the examiners concluded in the report that `` laith appears to have suffered severe and lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of his arrest and incarceration at abu ghraib prison . '' another detainee , youssef , was detained by u.s. soldiers nearly seven years ago when he tried to enter afghanistan from neighboring pakistan without a passport , the report says . he initially was held in an afghan prison , where he describes `` being stripped naked , being intimidated by dogs , being hooded and being thrown against the wall on repeated occasions , '' the report says . a few months later , he was taken to the guantanamo bay facility , where he was subjected to interrogators who would enter his cell and force him to lie on the floor with his hands tied behind his back to his feet , the report says . youssef said the interrogators wanted him to confess of involvement with the taliban , the report says . based on its investigation , the report calls on the u.s. government to issue a formal apology to detainees subject to torture and ill treatment by the military since fall 2001 in afghanistan , iraq , guantanamo bay and elsewhere . the rights group also demands that the bush administration : . • `` repudiate all forms of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment '' ; . • establish an independent commission to investigate and report publicly the circumstances of detention and interrogation at u.s.-run prisons in afghanistan , iraq and guantanamo bay ; . • hold individuals involved in torturing detainees accountable through criminal and civil processes ; and . • monitor thoroughly the conditions at u.s.-run prisons all over the world . cnn radio contributed to this report .

729	gladstone , illinois -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- residents of this small town in illinois , like many others who live along the banks of the surging mississippi river , raced against the clock tuesday to erect a makeshift levee as rising floodwaters threatened . residents of gladstone , illinois , work with the national guard to create a makeshift levee . `` i 'm not moving , not moving my business , '' said byron sebastian , a longtime resident of gladstone , illinois , who also serves on the city council . `` we 've got a lot of good people here helping to try to save this part of town . '' gladstone is one of many towns under threat tuesday after rising waters breached a 300-foot area of a levee near gulf port , illinois , before 5 a.m. levees all along the mid-mississippi were being topped with sandbags tuesday as the river , fed by its flooded tributaries , continued to rise . illinois gov. rod blagojevich called up 1,100 national guard members to assist in sandbagging efforts , said patti thompson of the illinois emergency management agency . she also said inmates are helping on the levees and others are bagging sand in correctional institutions . `` we were very , very disappointed that this levee broke today , '' said thompson . `` it 's a very powerful river , and it can be hard to harness . '' with the help of the national guard , sebastian and his fellow residents hustled tuesday to build a barrier between gladstone and the encroaching floodwaters . even though gladstone is about four miles from the banks of the mississippi , the rising floodwaters have submerged homes and created rivers where crop fields once stood . the muddy townspeople worked with anxious resolve , cracking the occasional joke , as they filled bags with sand and dirt and loaded them onto atvs . on the receiving end were members of the illinois national guard , who piled up the sandbags as the tops of cornstalks rose above the waters behind them . `` threats can happen in all shapes and forms , so we are trying to help out , '' said national guardsman capt. lanny finn , whose unit previously served in iraq . `` we 'll be here for as long as we 're needed .

'' harkin said iowans `` are a resilient and resourceful people , '' but will need `` generous federal assistance '' to recover . fema has set up six disaster recovery centers in iowa and has provided nearly $ 4 million in assistance , state and federal officials reported . so far , 24 counties are under federal disaster declarations , making residents eligible for individual aid , lt. gov. patty judge reported . by tuesday afternoon , residents of cedar rapids , iowa , where the cedar river inundated more than 400 city blocks , were beginning to return home as the rivers lessened , said lu barron , a linn county supervisor . `` we 're doing pretty good , '' she said . `` people are getting into their businesses , and getting into their homes .

730	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the director of federal emergency management agency on sunday defended giving away an estimated $ 85 million in hurricane relief supplies , blaming louisiana officials for turning down the stockpiles . a new orleans charity keeps goods in trash bags in an empty church . fema never told it about the free items . `` we still have quite a few left if louisiana needs those , '' david paulison said . `` but we did find out , we did ask louisiana , ` do you want these ? ' they said , ` no , we do n't need them . ' so we offered them to the other states . '' a cnn investigation revealed last week that fema gave away 121 truckloads of material the agency amassed after 2005 's hurricane katrina . the material was declared surplus property and offered to federal and state agencies -- including louisiana , where groups working to resettle hurricane victims say the supplies are still needed . paulison told cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer '' his agency distributed more than 90,000 `` living kits '' to people in louisiana whose homes were destroyed or damaged by katrina . the kits included cleaning supplies , mops , brooms , pots and pans . after cnn reported on the giveaway , louisiana officials asked that the supplies be redirected to the state , which originally passed on them . john medica , director of the louisiana 's federal property assistance agency , told cnn he was unaware katrina victims still needed the items because no agency had contacted his office . sen. mary landrieu of louisiana , an outspoken critic of fema 's response to the hurricane , told cnn the supply giveaway was `` just a shame . '' `` it 's just another example of the failings of the federal bureaucracy , '' said landrieu , who wrote homeland security secretary michael chertoff last week to request an explanation . `` we 're still trying to fix it . it 's going to take a lot more work . '' paulison said much of the stockpile included `` things we do n't normally store -- refrigerators , stoves , coolers , diapers , things like that . '' states , meanwhile , were requesting those items , he said . `` it did n't make any sense for fema to sit on this much stuff and supplies we normally do n't even keep . we have plenty of supplies in place if we have another disaster . we can duplicate that type of commodities and get them for people in need , '' he said . the agency 's chief spokesman , james mcintyre , had declined a request for an on-camera interview and told cnn the giveaway was `` not news . '' paulison said the story `` just really missed the mark '' -- that the supplies given away were not exclusively for katrina victims , but were `` donated from disasters all around the entire country . '' but e-mails from mcintyre and from the general services administration , which manages federal property , contradict paulison 's account . in an e-mail sent in april , mcintyre told cnn `` in many cases , items were purchased in the field by fema . '' and in a phone interview with cnn , mcintyre said , `` that is property that was purchased in response to katrina . we purchased most of that equipment because of the catastrophic nature of that disaster . '' general services administration spokeswoman viki reath wrote the supplies given away were `` surplus from the katrina and -lsb- hurricane -rsb- rita disasters ... some purchased by fema , some donated by foreign countries and federal government agencies . '' mcintyre said fema 's storage costs were running more than $ 1 million a year , and that gsa officials wanted to tear down the fort worth , texas , warehouses in which the stockpiles were being kept . cnn 's abbie boudreau and scott zamost contributed to this report .
731	flint , michigan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. barack obama monday proposed spending billions to revitalize the nation 's economy , a plan the campaign of his likely republican opponent said would slow economic growth with higher taxes . sen. barack obama wants to spend $ 60 billion on america 's infrastructure . during an economic speech in flint , michigan , obama promised to spend billions to improve america 's education , infrastructure , energy and health care systems . to improve america 's competitiveness , the senator from illinois said he wants to spend $ 10 billion on childhood education , $ 150 billion over 10 years on developing alternative energy and $ 60 billion over 10 years to build `` 21st century infrastructure . '' obama said he would pay for these programs by ending the war in iraq , reducing government waste , charging polluters for greenhouse gas emissions and ending the bush tax cuts for wealthy individuals . during his speech in michigan , a state hard hit by the decline of the american automobile industry , obama also rejected protectionist trade polices that many unions say would help protect american jobs , saying `` it is impossible to turn back the tide of globalization . '' watch obama call for america to compete in the global economy '' obama said he disagreed with those who want to `` build a fortress around america ; to stop trading with other countries , shut down immigration , and rely on old industries . '' `` not only is it impossible to turn back the tide of globalization , but efforts to do so can make us worse off , '' obama said . `` rather than fear the future , we must embrace it . i have no doubt that america can compete -- and succeed -- in the 21st century . '' a mccain spokesman attacked obama 's plan , saying the democrat 's `` agenda to raise taxes and isolate america from foreign markets will not get our economy back on track or create new jobs . '' `` to help create jobs in america , we need to lower taxes and open up foreign markets to american goods , '' said mccain spokesman tucker bounds . `` americans can not afford barack obama 's ` change ' that takes us back to the failed policies of the past . '' but obama said now was the time to commit to long-term investments in america 's future and blasted mccain for wanting to continue president bush 's economic policies , saying `` there is a clear choice in this election . instead of reaching for new horizons , george bush has put us in a hole , and john mccain 's policies will keep us there . i want to take us in a new and better direction . `` i reject the belief that we should either shrink from the challenge of globalization or fall back on the same tired and failed approaches of the last eight years , '' he said . `` it 's time for new policies that create the jobs and opportunities of the future -- a competitiveness agenda built upon education and energy , innovation and infrastructure , fair trade and reform . '' the two campaigns have been sparring over who would be a better steward of america 's ailing economy , and both candidates have been reaching out to blue-collar voters , many of whom backed republican president ronald reagan over the democrats , in part , because of cultural issues . `` i believe that there are stark differences between myself and sen. obama . ... and i believe that the same appeals that president reagan made to the so-called reagan democrats will succeed there , '' mccain said during a campaign stop in arlington , virginia . watch mccain vow to win reagan democrats '' a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released thursday suggested voters favor obama over mccain to handle the economy 50 percent to 44 percent . the poll , conducted june 4-5 , had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
732	-lrb- oprah.com -rrb- -- if you heard there was a weapon proven to prevent most crimes before they happen , would you run out and buy it ? world-renowned security expert gavin de becker says this weapon exists , but you already have it . he calls it `` the gift of fear . '' one chapter in gavin 's book `` the gift of fear '' has stuck with oprah since she first read it . the story of a woman named kelly begins with a simple warning sign . a man offers to help carry her groceries into her apartment -- and instantly , kelly does n't like the sound of his voice . kelly goes against her gut and lets him help her -- and in doing so , she lets a rapist into her home . `` we get a signal prior to violence , '' gavin says . `` there are preincident indicators . things that happen before violence occurs . '' gavin says that unlike any other living creature , humans will sense danger yet still walk right into it . `` you 're in a hallway waiting for an elevator late at night . elevator door opens , and there 's a guy inside , and he makes you afraid . you do n't know why , you do n't know what it is . some memory of this building -- whatever it may be . and many women will stand there and look at that guy and say , ` oh , i do n't want to think like that . i do n't want to be the kind of person who lets the door close in his face . i 've got to be nice . i do n't want him to think i 'm not nice . ' and so human beings will get into a steel soundproof chamber with someone they 're afraid of , and there 's not another animal in nature that would even consider it . '' for weeks , nicole had a funny feeling that something odd was going on in her apartment . `` my gut started feeling like something just was n't right , '' she says . `` i would come home , and there would be just weird lights on in my house -- lights that i did n't even remember turning on in the first place . '' then one day , nicole noticed a ups delivery box where it should n't be . `` i 'm like , ` how did this brand of box get on my back balcony ? ' '' nicole began to feel uneasy -- but continued to brush it off . `` i would just come home , you know , and almost feel nauseous , '' she says . `` i kept trying to justify it saying , ` okay , it is in my head . ' '' nicole 's funny feeling eventually escalated into full-fledged panic attacks , which gavin says were her intuition 's way of telling her that something was wrong . `` and intuition records everything . so when she started getting panics attacks , her intuition is saying , basically , ` you 're not going to listen ? okay , i 'll ramp it up . i 'll give you panic attacks . you want sleepless nights ? i 'll give you sleepless nights . ' '' nicole eventually did listen to her intuition , starting with a simple test . `` i dropped a tank top behind the door as i was leaving for work , thinking that when i come home that night , i 'm going to peek my head around the corner . if -lsb- the tank top -rsb- had been pushed to the side , it would have been obvious that the door was opened . '' when nicole got home , she says the tank top had moved . caught on camera . the next day , nicole says she set up a hidden camera to try and find out what was going on in her apartment . once she came home , nicole says she plugged the camcorder into her laptop . `` and the first thing i see is this man 's head peeking around the corner into my house , '' she says . `` what i felt at that point was just complete terror . i 'm sitting there watching this video -- this story unfold -- and this person comes in my house , is looking around , going through my things , looking through my laundry , holding up my lingerie . '' as nicole continues to watch in horror , the intruder undresses himself and puts her lingerie on . `` so this person is in my clothes , proceeds to start pleasuring himself -- just very , very graphic things happening right there in my house with my belongings . and he finishes up , takes off my clothes -- and puts them exactly back as i had left them -- puts his clothes back on , checks to make sure nobody 's outside the door and leaves . '' after watching the tape , nicole says she ran around her apartment , screaming hysterically . she says she had never seen the man in the tape before . `` initially , i took my cell phone , called my boyfriend at the time , screaming hysterically . all i could say was , ` he 's in my house . he 's in my house . ' even picking up the phone , dialing , was difficult . '' two weeks later , police found the man -- 39-year-old shawn rogers , a computer consultant with a young son and a wife at the time . police were unable to charge rogers with anything more than trespassing ... until he came back to nicole 's apartment to steal her camera . police were able to charge rogers with burglary , and he was sentenced to eight years in prison . dangerous behavior . when nicole found the ups box on her balcony , gavin says this was a warning sign . gavin applauds nicole for listening to her intuition and says that quieting her fear could have caused the situation to escalate . `` he 's already into behavior of wanting to get caught , '' he says . `` you do n't come back again and again and again and not want to get caught . '' gavin says like nicole , the intruder 's intuition was probably trying to tell him something too . `` offenders as well can see what 's happening in their lives . and talk about not listening to it -- he 's in someone 's apartment doing something sexual with their clothes on -- that 's something to listen to . '' because the intruder had a job and a family , gavin says his behavior was not only reckless , but dangerous as well . `` when people do listen , they can stop what 's almost fate , '' gavin says . `` there 's a great line that carl jung said . he said , ` what we do not make conscious emerges later as fate . ' if he made it conscious , if he could talk to someone about it , if he could tell someone , he could get better also . but he did n't , and it does mean escalation . if she discovered him , that 's dangerous . if he came in when she was there , that 's dangerous . '' your feelings are warnings . doris , who says she endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of her husband , appeared on `` the oprah show '' after leaving her husband . unfortunately , her battle did n't end there -- two months after she left him , doris 's ex-husband abducted her at gunpoint and raped her . after the show , oprah spoke with doris again to ask if her she had sensed any warning signs the night she was abducted . `` as i was coming home from work , it was just a very eerie , strange feeling as i drove up , '' doris says . `` it was darker than normal in my driveway , and there was a trash can sitting where i normally park right in the middle . `` i thought , ` hmm , this is strange . ' because my mother lives with me , and she 'll turn on the lights when it gets dark . it did give me a little eerie feeling -- the hairs on the back of your neck kind of stand up . but still , i did n't listen to my instincts . '' gavin says that `` eerie feeling '' is exactly what he wants women to pay attention to . `` we 're trying to analyze the warning signs , '' he says . `` and what i really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign . all the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling . why it was this , why it was that . the feeling itself is the warning sign .

'' her new speeches will include more details about her family and humble upbringing on chicago 's south side , aides said . michelle obama graduated from harvard law school , was a vice president at the university of chicago and landed a job as a health care executive making $ 275,000 a year . but along with her success has come criticism -- that 's she 's too angry , too negative and too sarcastic . now , the woman who would become the first black first lady is trying to connect with voters on a more personal level . watch experts weigh in on how michelle obama is perceived '' on wednesday , she made an appearance as a guest co-host on abc 's `` the view , '' and later this week , she and her husband will grace the cover of us weekly . the magazine is headlined `` michelle obama : why barack loves her , '' and includes details about her love for target , `` sex and the city '' and her daughters ' recitals . asked wednesday while on `` the view '' if she 's going through a makeover , she said she realizes `` i wear my heart on my sleeve '' and that `` it 's a risk you have to take . '' she said she thinks people will change their perception of her as they see her family more . michelle obama 's spokeswoman , katie mccormick lelyveld , said earlier there is no `` image makeover '' in the works . watch what michelle obama would be like as first lady '' `` she has staff engaged in simply part of the process of growing to a general election campaign and putting a strategy together to help people get to know her , '' lelyveld said . `` it 's what you do as you move from primary voters to general election voters . '' carl sferrazza anthony , a first ladies historian , said it 's important for michelle obama to define herself before others define her . `` one comment made off-hand ... might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition , '' he said . michelle obama saw that in february when a republican ad used a snippet from a campaign event in which , referring to record voter turnout in the democratic primaries , she said , `` for the first time in my adult lifetime , i am really proud of my country . '' obama 's campaign says she was just excited about the grassroots support , but her words still provided fodder for her husband 's opponents . the day after the comments , cindy mccain , wife of presumptive republican nominee john mccain , introduced her husband saying , `` i do n't know about you , if you heard those words earlier -- i am very proud of my country . '' michelle obama has been a vocal advocate for her husband while on the campaign trail , delivering sometimes impassioned speeches on his behalf . robin givhan , fashion editor with the washington post , said people see michelle obama in different ways . `` some people will see confidence , and others might see cockiness . i think some people will see strength . others might see arrogance , '' she said . `` she comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with . '' behind the scenes , she maintains that independence . according to the campaign , michelle obama picks out her own clothes . she received a lot of attention for the sleeveless purple dress and pearls she wore the night her husband became the presumptive democratic nominee . beyond her style , though , a sense of dignity may be what most defines a first lady . it 's a job that requires the ability to strike a balance between queen and commoner . exactly how michelle obama refines her approach on the stump remains to be seen , staffers said . `` we 'll see , '' jarrett said . `` she 's learned a lot of stories along the way from the american people , i think she may incorporate some more of the stories that she 's heard that resonate with what she 's seeing in terms of the direction that people want the country to take . but the rest is up to her . we 'll see what she comes up with .

743	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- congress passed a $ 300 billion farm bill over president bush 's veto for a second time wednesday , a step made necessary by a clerical error when the original bill passed . congress overrode president bush 's second veto of a $ 300 billion farm bill . the senate voted 80-14 to approve the measure over bush 's objections , following a 317-109 vote in the house of representatives . both votes were well above the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto , which bush delivered wednesday morning . congress overrode an earlier veto of the farm bill last month , even though lawmakers had discovered that 34 pages were missing in the version originally sent to the white house . in spiking the latest version , bush said he objected to its continued subsidies for the wealthy and its use of budget gimmicks to hide a $ 20 billion increase in spending . but sen. kent conrad , the chairman of the senate budget committee , said the measure actually saves the government $ 110 million . `` this bill does not add to the deficit or debt , because this bill is paid for , '' he said . `` that is not my claim . that is the finding of the congressional budget office . '' the discovery of the missing section , title iii , prompted concerns from house republicans that the override vote was improper . house speaker nancy pelosi said the sections of the bill that were originally sent to the president had become law after congress voted to override bush 's first veto . but to put title iii into effect , congress re-passed the entire legislation , including the missing pages , and resent it to bush . the house voted 306-110 at the end of may . the senate voted 77-15 for the bill at the beginning of june . two-thirds of the $ 300 billion in spending for the farm bill will go for nutrition programs such as food stamps . another $ 40 billion will go toward farm subsidies , and $ 30 billion is allocated for payments to farms to keep land idle and other environmental programs . after vetoing the latest version of the farm bill , bush scolded congress on wednesday for not `` modifying certain objectionable , onerous and fiscally imprudent provisions . ... i am returning this bill for the same reasons as stated in my veto message . '' when he vetoed the first version of the farm bill , bush said it `` continues subsidies for the wealthy and increases farm bill spending by more than $ 20 billion , while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase . '' the president said it would hurt efforts to improve american farmers ' access to overseas markets . congress has passed one other bill over bush 's objections : legislation for a $ 23 billion water project that the president vetoed in 2007 . cnn capitol hill producer deirdre walsh contributed to this report .
744	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- an alabama man whose wife died during a honeymoon scuba diving trip off the coast of australia almost five years ago has been charged in her death . tina watson , background right , lies motionless after she drowned in 2003 while diving in the great barrier reef . an australian coroner ruled friday that there was enough evidence to put gabe watson on trial for the death of tina watson , who was 26 when she drowned in october 2003 while diving around a historic shipwreck in australia 's great barrier reef . watson , 31 , told police that his new bride appeared to panic 45 feet underwater and that he `` looked into her eyes and saw her eyes were wide open , but there was no response , '' townsville coroner david glascow said in his inquest findings . glascow , however , cited what he said were inconsistencies in watson 's statements to investigators . the coroner said he was `` unable to conclude that tina 's death was an accidental drowning . '' watch tina watson 's family demand justice '' the couple married just 11 days earlier in birmingham , alabama . they left their home in hoover , alabama , for their australian honeymoon two days later , the coroner said . as possible evidence for the husband 's motive , glascow pointed to a statement by the woman 's father that watson asked her to maximize her life insurance and make him the beneficiary shortly before the wedding . the insurance company confirmed that gabe watson inquired about her life insurance policy after her death , the coroner said . the coroner noted that watson , through his lawyers , contended that police had made a judgment that he killed his wife before they began their investigation and that they tailored their investigation to fit their theory . glascow said he saw no evidence of police rushing to judgment . `` it appears certain that at some point in time , investigators considered some of gabe 's explanations lacked credibility , and it further appears to me that investigators gave gabe the opportunity to clarify matters which may have caused concern , '' the coroner said . the husband was an experienced diver , and his new wife was considered a novice , the coroner said . they were diving on the yongala shipwreck about 42 miles off the coast of townsville in the state of queensland , australia .
745	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the supreme court ruled wednesday morning that child rapists can not be given the death penalty , effectively reserving the punishment only for murderers . cnn 's jeffrey toobin said the court 's ruling falls in line with other decisions on the death penalty . the 5-4 decision stems from a louisiana case in which patrick kennedy , 43 , was sentenced to die in 2003 for the sexual assault of his 8-year-old stepdaughter . proponents of louisiana 's law , which allowed child rapists to be eligible for the death penalty , say that besides murder , no crime is more deserving of the death penalty than child rape . kennedy would have been the first rapist in 44 years to be executed for a crime in which the victim was not killed . in the majority opinion , justice anthony kennedy said `` evolving standards of decency '' forbid capital punishment for any crime other than murder . cnn 's senior legal analyst , jeffrey toobin , spoke with cnn 's heidi collins outside the supreme court about the impact of the ruling . collins : this is a huge decision here . what do you make of it ? toobin : it was just high drama in the court today . it 's always dramatic at the end of the supreme court term . here it was literally life and death , one of the big open questions in constitutional law about the death penalty : can you execute someone for a crime other than murder ? anthony kennedy , the swing vote on so many cases , decided this case , it was 5-4 . ... he did n't diminish the seriousness of the crime , but he said the risks of expanding the death penalty are simply too great . he pointed out that there are more than 5,000 child rapes every year in the united states . all of them would raise the possibility of the death penalty . there are only a handful of states -- i think it was six -- that allow the death penalty for child rape . forty-four states and the federal government say no . he said there is a national consensus that this is not an appropriate punishment . so , this really rules out not just the death penalty for child rape , but any crime other than murder . so it 's a major , major decision . see more about the reach of the decision '' collins : a national consensus except those six states . it 's interesting when you look at the court of public opinion . how do you think this decision is going to go down in public ? toobin : well , i think it 's a tough call because support for the death penalty nationwide in the past 10 years has actually been going down . but child rape is such a horrendous crime and all of us have such a natural revulsion towards it that you 're never going to get a lot of support for any sort of reduction in sentence . but i think , given the fact that this is a supreme court that said no death penalty for murderers under 18 , no death penalty for the mentally retarded , this decision is consistent with a certain restriction on the death penalty , which is reflected in the court but also in a kind of national change that 's going on . collins : and in sean callebs ' piece that we had , i do n't know if you heard it . toobin : i saw it , yeah . collins : one woman , who actually brought up a very interesting point , when you think about all of this and when you think about the child , the victim , she said , you know , if they know they 're going to die for this crime , why would they leave a living witness ? toobin : justice kennedy made precisely that point in the opinion . he said , allowing the death penalty here would create a perverse incentive for child rapists to murder their victims . he also pointed out what a difficult moral choice it would put child victims in testifying , giving children literally the power of life and death in their testimony over their attackers . that is something that he wanted to relieve children of -- that burden . collins : will they always have to testify ? toobin : yeah , pretty much . there have been rare examples ... if a child , for example , is simply too young to testify . there are horrible cases of rapes of babies and things like that . but by and large there has to be some sort of testimony from a child . it can be in a noncourtroom setting . it can be sort of in a deposition , not in front of the jury . but you do have to have the child testify . collins : it 's just such a tough decision all around . 5-4 on that one , very interesting .

'' luke russert says dinner table political discussions were part of his upbringing . besides the youth vote , russert discussed his father 's death , his upbringing and his own future in journalism and political commentary . tim russert , 58 , was the host of nbc 's `` meet the press '' and one of america 's leading political journalists . he died of a heart attack after collapsing at the network 's washington bureau on june 13 . the following is an edited version of the show 's transcript . watch video of the discussion '' larry king : how did you learn of your dad 's passing ? luke russert : i was in florence , and i was at an italian sports bar watching the italy versus romania game , and i got a call from my dad 's secretary that said he had fainted , and could i get in touch with my mother . luckily , i was right across the street from the hotel where my mom was . i ran up to her room and said , `` dad has fainted . '' and we kind of learned in increments of what exactly happened . so it was basically about a half-hour after first hearing that he fainted that we actually knew he collapsed and had a heart attack . and at first , i was upset that i was so far away and removed . and i really wanted to be there . but in reality , it was really a blessing to be an ocean away , because it allowed my mother and me to have some real private time to collect our thoughts , to grieve in private , and not be inundated with all the media coverage and all the phone calls . so , you know , it was something that -- it was difficult , but to have that little cocoon , i think my mother and i really used it to our benefit . king : must have been a long flight back . russert : it was . it was a long nine-hour flight . but my mother has been so strong through this . and my family has been there for me every step of the way . my girlfriend has been wonderful . so i ca n't thank everybody enough . and obviously this happened , but it has made it a lot easier to have such good friends at nbc and all through washington and my family personally . king : were you brought up talking politics ? russert : i was . it was always something that was always talked around the dinner table with my father and my mother from a very young age . one of my earliest memories is being a young toddler and remembering ronald reagan 's face on television . my dad was watching a press conference , most likely at that time on cnn . and it was just something that i always grew up around . and we also talked a lot of sports . we talked a lot of culture . but politics was something that i guess has been engrained in me at a very , very young age . king : did he pick the brains of you and your friends ? russert : he did . we would actually have some fun discussions where i would assume the role of who his guest would be on sunday and try to answer the questions that he threw at me . and sometimes , if i could answer a question pretty well , he 'd say , `` that question 's too easy , i 've got to get rid of it . '' so sometimes , i was a guinea pig for politicians . but it was a lot of fun . i enjoyed doing it . and he would also pick the brains of some of my friends . some did pretty well , and some did n't . but he was always kind to all of us . king : when did you first vote ? russert : i first voted when i was 18 , which would have been 2004 . and i registered at the same time i registered for the selective service , which i think they do here in the district of columbia . so i 've been a registered voter since 2004 , and that 's the first time i cast an official ballot . king : how did it feel to vote ? russert : it felt great . it kind of felt like you became a man or at least an adult in some capacity . that your decision -- your decision -- became part of the country and its leadership . and i 'll never forget the way i voted was i was in college my freshman year , 2004 , so i had to go by absentee ballot . and i was going to meet my father in south bend , indiana , for the notre dame/boston college game . and i said , `` dad , i 'd rather you bring the ballot personally so it does n't have to go through the mail , send it up to me in boston . '' so he brought the ballot , and i filled out my absentee ballot in a south bend , indiana , hotel room , and he brought it back and put it right in the fedex for me . king : we have an e-mail question for you from david in cary , north carolina . `` luke , my condolences , '' it said . `` you 've shown great strength and character in recent days . any chance we 'll see you reporting or doing commentary about the 2008 election ? '' russert : oh yes , you just might . it 's something that i 'm definitely interested in . i think that i will probably be part of the peacock network . but you never know . i still have the sports show on xm radio and carville , and i kind of go into politics . but i would n't mind . king : what if cnn made a bid for you ? russert : i 'd be your assistant , larry ? king : you got it . you could come to work for us . i think i can speak for management . in fact , they 'll probably talk to you tomorrow based on just how well you 're handling yourself tonight . russert : well , i appreciate it . everyone has been so kind . i 'd love to have the opportunity to come out here and talk about something that is important to me . and it was important to my father , which was young people getting involved . that really is the important issue tonight . not me . that 's important .

'' three of the charges stem from a document titled `` the transitional strategy , '' which biti is said to have written ahead of the march 29 election . biti is denying that he wrote the document , and his lawyers described it as `` doctored . '' the fourth charge of communicating falsehoods alleges that biti announced that tsvangirai had won the march presidential election by an outright majority , meaning no runoff vote would be needed . in recent weeks , opposition groups and churches have reported numerous cases of kidnappings , torture and other violence in the country targeting opponents of mugabe . zanu-pf members have been suspected of being behind the acts . zanu-pf claims that the mdc is behind the violence . it said mdc members attacked the mayor of kadoma , a city 140 km -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- southwest of harare . it also accused mdc activists of causing millions of dollars damage to private business . last week , mugabe warned that veterans he commanded in his country 's liberation war nearly three decades ago would take up arms again if tsvangirai won . watch an ad vilifying tsvangirai '' the mdc is using word of mouth and file-sharing sites such as youtube to disseminate its campaign advertisements , claiming that they are banned by state media . the group sent advertisements to supporters via e-mail , asking them to forward them to their friends and relatives . `` since the regime has denied the mdc access to state media , please send the adverts to as many people as you can , '' the e-mail says . `` a new zimbabwe is near . the dictator is finished . let 's finish it !

750	yusufiya , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- female suicide bombers , who often slip through security checkpoints untouched because of cultural norms , are taking a more deadly toll than ever across iraq . a female suicide bomber struck northeast of baghdad on sunday , killing 16 . but the u.s. army has created a solution with `` daughters of iraq , '' a program that trains iraqi women to find female suicide bombers . women carried out eight bombings in all of 2007 , according to the u.s. military . halfway through 2008 , the number of female suicide bombers is 20 . a suicide attack carried out by a woman on sunday in baquba killed at least 16 people and wounded another 40 . `` daughters of iraq '' is a spinoff of `` sons of iraq , '' which employs iraqi men to run checkpoints and is credited with taking much of the steam out of the insurgency . the goal of the women 's program is twofold : to protect against female suicide bombers , and to provide much-needed income to iraqi women with few chances for employment . in the town of yusufiya , southwest of baghdad , some 30 women are being trained to search other females at security checkpoints -- something men are forbidden to do under iraqi cultural norms . in mid-may , a female suicide bomber killed an iraqi army officer in this town . `` when he came out to meet her to help her with a problem she was having , she detonated the vest and killed him and injured some of his soldiers , '' said michael starz , a u.s. army captain . the women will work two or three days a month , making up to $ 300 , an iraqi military officer explained to applicants . in a community , where families struggle to survive , that 's good money . watch how `` daughters of iraq '' works '' the women come from small farming communities . many of them are widows with numerous children and almost no income . such is the story of fawzia , who has six children to support . her husband was shot to death when his car broke down . `` i am ready -lrb- to work -rrb- as long as it helps me financially , '' she said . `` i have five children in school . '' having women work in this tradition-bound society is a social revolution , according to fatima , a volunteer leader , told cnn 's jill dougherty . `` many women would like to do it but their parents would not agree because it 's a rural society and it 's shameful for girls to go outside the home .

751	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the first pictures from nasa 's mars phoenix lander , which successfully touched down near mars ' north pole sunday , showed a pattern of brown polygons as far as the camera could see . the mars phoenix lander took this image of the planet 's surface at its landing site sunday . `` it 's surprisingly close to what we expected and that 's what surprises me most , '' said peter smith , the mission 's principal investigator . `` i expected a bigger surprise . '' the landing on the red planet 's arctic plains -- which ended a 296-day journey -- was right on target , a feat nasa 's ed weiler compared to landing a hole-in-one with a golf ball from 10,000 miles . the landing -- dubbed the `` seven minutes of terror '' -- was a nerve-wracking experience for mission managers , who have witnessed the failure of similar missions . in mission control at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , they celebrated the lander 's much-anticipated entry . `` it was better than we could have imagined , '' barry goldstein , project manager for the phoenix mission , told cnn . watch the celebration at mission control '' the phoenix 's 90-day mission is to analyze the soils and permafrost of mars ' arctic tundra for signs of past or present life . the lander is equipped with a robotic arm capable of scooping up ice and dirt to look for organic evidence that life once existed there , or even exists now . `` we are not going to be able to answer the final question of is there life on mars , '' said principal investigator peter smith , an optical scientist with the university of arizona . `` we will take the next important step . we 'll find out if there 's organic material associated with this ice in the polar regions . ice is a preserver , and if there ever were organics on mars and they got into that ice , they will still be there today . '' the twin to the mars polar lander spacecraft , phoenix was supposed to travel to mars in 2001 as the mars surveyor spacecraft . they were originally part of the `` better , faster , cheaper '' program , formulated by then-nasa administrator dan goldin to beef up planetary exploration on a lean budget . but polar malfunctioned during its descent into mars ' atmosphere in 1999 and crashed . an investigation concluded that as many as a dozen design flaws or malfunctions doomed the spacecraft . the failure of that mission , as well as another spacecraft called the mars climate orbiter the same year , led to nasa to put future missions on hold and rethink the `` better , faster , cheaper '' approach . mars surveyor went to the warehouse . watch the challenges the mission faced '' but all was not lost . in 2003 , smith proposed a plan to re-engineer the mars surveyor and fly it on a mission to look for signatures of life in the ice and dirt of mars far north . mars phoenix , literally and figuratively , rose from the ashes of surveyor . engineers set to work , testing and retesting the onboard system to ferret out and fix all the flaws they could find . ireport.com : send your photos , video of space . `` we always have to be scared to death , '' goldstein said . `` the minute we lose fear is the minute that we stop looking for the next problem . '' the team was concerned about the phoenix landing system . nasa had not successfully landed a probe on mars using landing legs and stabilizing thrusters since the viking missions in the late 1970s . the other three successful mars landings -- pathfinder in 1997 and the spirit and opportunity rovers in 2004 -- used massive airbags that inflated around the landing craft just before landing to cushion the impact . learn about nasa 's past missions to mars '' the phoenix does n't have airbags because the lander is too big and heavy for them to work properly . its landing site was targeted for the far northern plains of mars , near the northern polar ice cap . data from the mars odyssey spacecraft indicate large quantities of ice there , likely in the form of permafrost , either on the surface or just barely underground . `` follow the water '' has become the unifying theme of nasa 's mars exploration strategy . in 2004 , the rover opportunity found evidence that a salty sea once lapped the shores of an area near mars ' equator called meridiani planum . astrobiologists generally agree that it 's best to look for life in wet places . cnn 's kate tobin contributed to this report .

753	harare , zimbabwe -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- with polls closed for a zimbabwe runoff that opposition politicians and international observers call a sham , alleged torture victims who support former candidate morgan tsvangirai said friday that they back his decision to pull out of the race . many of the injured being treated at a private hospital in harare , zimbabwe , asked not to be identified . `` it 's a good move by my president , morgan tsvangirai , '' said a 26-year-old movement for democratic change activist who said he was forced to stand on hot coals and had boiling water poured on him about a week ago . `` there 's no use going for an election . '' the man , who displayed a large , pale , blistered patch on his back , asked not to be identified -- as did others being treated at a private hospital in harare -- for fear of further attacks by gangs supportive of president robert mugabe . all of the victims said they were taken to `` torture bases '' by the gangs , made up of young men and soldiers . in the march 29 election , mdc officials said their polling showed tsvangirai clearly defeating mugabe , who at 84 is the only president zimbabwe has had since it gained independence from britain in 1980 . but after delaying the release of results for more than a week , the country 's electoral commission -- which is made up of mugabe appointees -- said that although tsvangirai got more votes , he did n't top the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff . mdc supporters had already reported violence against them by police , military members and other supporters of mugabe 's zanu-pf party . but in the weeks leading up to the runoff , the reports increased in frequency and intensity . more than 70 people were killed in attacks since the election , according to the mdc . mugabe 's supporters have claimed that those attacks were against his party members , a claim international observers , including the united nations , have disputed . watch victims say they were taken to torture camps '' tsvangirai and other party leaders were repeatedly arrested by police or detained on their way to political rallies . and reports of beatings and other intimidation tactics were common in areas where the mdc had made strong showings in the election . `` mostly for the rural people -- the police would come in for the zanu-pf , so the area was very tense , '' said a municipal worker at the hospital , who said he was kicked and had burning plastic poured on his skin about three or four days ago . `` everyone was beaten . whether zanu-pf or mdc . there was chaos in the country . '' george charamba , a spokesman for mugabe , insisted that the vote was `` free and fair . '' charamba denied that any pressure was being used . asked about images from zimbabwe showing what is reported to be violence against members of the opposition , he responded , `` i thought we are long past the age where we could consider pictures as not lying . it 's very , very easy for anyone to stage-manage a demonstration , and a violent one at that . '' last weekend , tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff , saying there was no way the result would be legitimate . he has spent much of the time since living in the dutch embassy in harare in fear for his safety . early friday , the municipal worker said he was considering whether to heed tsvangirai 's call for his supporters to not vote in the election , but the question may be moot . the gangs took his identification card and threw it into a fire , he said . another man and a woman treated for broken hands at the hospital said they were tortured and had boiling water poured on their genitals for being mdc supporters . the man said he was forced to drink sewage . meanwhile , mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters from zimbabwe 's state-run media as he cast his ballot at a high school . `` very optimistic , upbeat ... and hungry , '' he said when asked how he was feeling .
754	editor 's note : saturday marks one year since hamas ' defeat of fatah in the fierce struggle for control of gaza . cnn correspondent ben wedeman has been covering the region for over 15 years . he reports from gaza on daily life and reality over the past year in this fractious land . cnn 's ben wedeman reports on the past year in gaza , where people are safer but out of food , gas , and patience . gaza city , gaza -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- `` if you take pictures , i 'll kill you ! i 'll kill you ! '' screamed a masked fatah gunman , pointing his ak-47 assault rifle at my cameraman , joe duran . `` calm down ! calm down ! '' i shouted back at him , turning to joe to tell him to put the camera down . joe and i had ducked into a fruit and vegetable shop in gaza city . we had been covering the funeral of a fatah gunman killed in a clash with hamas rivals when our third gunbattle of the day had broken out . the gunman left , much to everyone 's relief , and i put my small video camera on the floor and pressed the button to record the constant roar of machine gun fire , which went on for more than half an hour . earlier in the day , joe and i were on a street corner videotaping hamas militiamen when a jeep full of fatah irregulars opened fire , just down the street from an elementary school . as guns blazed , schoolchildren ran for cover . i watched as shopkeeper khadar aliyan slammed shut the doors of his grocery store , the expression on his face one of fear and utter exasperation . `` i 'm going home , '' he told me . `` i 'm afraid . we 're done for . it 's never been this bad . '' it was violence like this , which we witnessed on december 2006 , that reached a climax in the second week of june 2007 . when it ended on june 14 , 2007 , with hamas roundly defeating fatah , gaza went quiet . and quiet -- relative quiet , that is -- has been hamas ' biggest accomplishment since . no longer do you worry about being kidnapped . gunbattles , though they can happen , are much less common . after last june 's takeover -lrb- or coup d'etat , as fatah supporters call it -rrb- , hamas quickly imposed law and order , tried to reacquaint gaza 's drivers with long-forgotten traffic regulations , launched a municipal cleanup campaign , and forced the release of kidnapped bbc journalist alan johnston , who had been held in captivity for almost six months . chaos-weary gazans applauded all of these initiatives . but the honeymoon ended quickly as reality sank in . since hamas won parliamentary elections in january 2006 , and even more so since last year 's takeover , israel has tightened its siege of gaza . israel has restricted supplies of gasoline , diesel and electricity to gaza , limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip , and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in gaza to export anything to the outside world . israeli officials say these measures are intended to pressure hamas , which is on the u.s. government list of terrorist groups , to stop its members and other factions from firing mortars and rockets into israel . israel defense forces reports that 1,500 qassam rockets were fired into israel from gaza in 2007 , and 2,383 in the past six years . as a result , almost all of gaza 's factories have shut down and thousands of workers have lost their jobs . between 70 and 80 percent of the population is dependent on food supplied by the united nations refugee works agency , set up after more than 700,000 palestinians became refugees after the war that resulted in israel 's creation in 1948 . life in gaza , never easy , in the last year has become a grinding daily struggle to make ends meet . for the vast majority of gazans , it means they must spend much of their time trying to secure basic commodities . such as cooking gas , which comes from israel . in the past , when supplies were plentiful , it was sold from the back of trucks and donkey carts . not anymore . when there are supplies , people flock to a few distribution centers . one is a hot , crowded compound north of gaza city , where the stench of gas is so strong you shudder with fear that someone will light a cigarette and the whole place will go up in flames . people have to wait for their cooking gas for hours some claim days , in the hot sun . there i met a woman who identified herself as um wadi'a -lrb- the mother of wadi'a -rrb- , who at 2 p.m. told me she had been waiting since 5 a.m. . she said she had run out of cooking gas three days before . typical of so many people here , she blamed both main palestinian factions for her woes . `` hamas has n't done anything for us , nor has fatah , '' she said . `` all those people want is to sit comfortably on their thrones . '' in gaza city , long lines of immobile cars and trucks wind around the block from gas stations , their owners waiting , surprisingly patiently , for supplies to arrive . the only other option is to go in search of black market gasoline , much of it smuggled through tunnels from egypt . it goes for more than $ 10 a liter , which comes close to almost $ 50 a gallon . it is now common for families to divide up responsibilities for the day . one family member will go in search of cooking gas , another will join the line for gasoline or diesel , another for whatever else is in short supply . to get around the shortages , some motorists mix their fuel with cooking oil , a practice that is n't particularly good for the motor . many people complain that it 's unhealthy -- but it works . others , like electrical engineer wasim khazandar , are thinking completely outside the box . wasim has invented an electric car , which he is more than happy to show off . he 's already received dozens of orders from motorists weary of the search for fuel . beyond material concerns , there are worries here that hamas has a barely concealed hardline islamist agenda , and one often hears complaints that the group is intolerant of any form of dissent or criticism . one man who can testify to that is ibrahim abu al-naja , the most senior fatah leader to remain in gaza after most fled to safety in ramallah . abu al-naja is from the fatah old school , a grizzled veteran of the group 's wars in lebanon . he told me earlier this year hamas security officials showed up at his home late at night , bound his hands , put a blindfold on him and dragged him to their headquarters , where they shaved his head and cut off his moustache , then released him without apology or explanation . he makes no excuses for fatah 's dismal track record of corruption and mismanagement when it ran gaza , but says the crisis that began with hamas ' rise to power is nothing short of a catastrophe . `` our people has been transformed , '' he said , `` into a desperate people , who must search for food , for the minimum of survival . it 's as if we returned to 1948 , dependent on gifts and assistance and relief . '' despite all the difficulties of life under hamas , despite all the grumbling , the men who run gaza are as confident today as they were a year ago that they will weather the crisis and emerge stronger . last wednesday i went to see ahmed yusif , a senior adviser to hamas prime minister ismail haniya . `` whatever the israelis think , '' said the u.s.-educated yusif , `` whatever pressure they put on us , it 's not going to make us buckle or give concessions . `` this is part of the palestinian struggle for more than 60 years living in the refugee camps , '' he said . `` we do n't always enjoy a good life . it 's the toughness and the suffering -lsb- that -rsb- are part of the struggle . '' others here do n't quite see it that way , like a man i met in gaza 's old market who would only identify himself as abu khalid . i asked him if he was better off today than a year ago . he laughed , cursed israel , hamas , fatah , the united states , the european union and the rest of the world , then made the following suggestion : `` let them open a market in gaza so we can sell some of our children -lsb- in order to -rsb- feed the rest .

757	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the bush administration hailed north korea 's declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with south korea , china , japan and russia . workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at north korea 's yongbyon nuclear facility this year . in fact , north korea 's confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at yongbyon -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing north korea 's nuclear program . as a result of pyongyang 's handover of the 60-page declaration document -- and friday 's expected destruction of the cooling tower at yongbyon -- president bush ordered some sanctions against north korea lifted and instructed the state department to remove the reclusive communist nation from u.s. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism . but as important as what the document says is what it does n't say . there is no mention of how many weapons north korea has or where they are hidden . nor did north korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with syria . both issues are reduced in the declaration to `` concerns '' pyongyang promises to address down the road . bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice have pledged a robust verification process to double-check north korea 's claims . and north korea has promised to allow u.s. inspectors access to the yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts . but it is far from clear whether pyongyang will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the united states will need to get a complete picture of north korea 's program . congressional republicans not so sure about pyongyang . the stiffest opposition to the deal is coming from conservative republicans . once considered president bush 's strongest allies in confronting north korea 's nuclear ambition , they feel that the bush administration has let north korea off the hook , especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to syria . rep. ileana ros-lehtinen , r-florida , the top republican on the foreign affairs committee , expressed `` profound disappointment '' over bush 's announcement that north korea would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism . and rep. pete hoekstra , r-michigan , the top republican on the permanent select committee on intelligence , accused president bush of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success . `` a decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the white house to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of north korea 's nuclear efforts , '' hoekstra said . `` lifting sanctions and removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures . '' rep. ed royce , r-california , called north korea 's declaration late and incomplete , alleging that north korea built a nuclear facility for syria , considered a terrorist state by the united states , while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing . that , he said , was proof that pyongyang ca n't be trusted . `` how do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you have ? '' royce asked . `` this is a signal to other proliferating regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up . '' democrats , who once criticized bush for not talking directly to north korea about its nuclear program , are cautiously supportive of the deal . howard berman , the democratic chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , called the north 's submission of a declaration `` encouraging . '' even former presidential candidate sen. john kerry , d-massachusetts , praised the bush administration , saying `` engaging our enemies can pay dividends . '' but kerry added , `` historians will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage north korea before pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons , tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them . '' are we headed down the same road with iran ? in his 2002 state of the union address , bush termed iraq , north korea and iran the `` axis of evil , '' saying they were `` arming to threaten the peace of the world . '' fourteen months after delivering that speech -- and after dictator saddam hussein released a 12,000-page declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction -- u.s. forces invaded iraq . but no such program was found , nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction . more than five years into the war , the united states is still battling al qaeda and iraqi insurgents there . six-party talks with north korea began in 2003 , after north korea withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . progress was limited until 2007 , when north korea agreed to shut down yongbyon and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and verification . progress has been even more limited for the third member of the `` axis of evil , '' iran . the bush administration has joined the other members of the u.n. security council -- britain , france , china and russia , along with germany -- in offering iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones north korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program . but the united states has refused to sit down with iran until that suspension takes place . the u.n. security council has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against iran , and the united states has worked with some success to isolate iran from the international financial community . but unlike north korea , which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid , iran is rich in oil and a powerful force in the middle east . and it 's only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices skyrocket . and iran seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new u.s. president . sen. barack obama , the presumptive democratic nominee , has pledged to engage iran in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions . sen. john mccain , the presumptive gop nominee , has taken a much tougher line , refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nuclear-armed iran . with the coming change in the u.s. administration , u.s. officials , diplomats and other iran experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the united states and iran could seriously think about talking . meanwhile , by its own admission , iran continues to perfect its nuclear technology . if the north korean experience can serve as a lesson for the next u.s. president , that lesson may well be that the longer the united states waits to talk to iran , the higher the cost will be to get tehran out of the nuclear business .

759	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the bush administration has launched a `` significant escalation '' of covert operations in iran , sending u.s. commandos to spy on the country 's nuclear facilities and undermine the islamic republic 's government , journalist seymour hersh said sunday . an iranian flag flies outside the building containing the reactor of bushehr nuclear power plant , south of tehran . white house , cia and state department officials declined comment on hersh 's report , which appears in this week 's issue of the new yorker . hersh told cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer '' that congress has authorized up to $ 400 million to fund the secret campaign , which involves u.s. special operations troops and iranian dissidents . president bush and vice president dick cheney have rejected findings from u.s. intelligence agencies that iran has halted a clandestine effort to build a nuclear bomb and `` do not want to leave iran in place with a nuclear program , '' hersh said . `` they believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year , either iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program , '' hersh said . the new article , `` preparing the battlefield , '' is the latest in a series of articles accusing the bush administration of preparing for war with iran . he based the report on accounts from current and former military , intelligence , and congressional sources . watch hersh discuss what he says are the administration 's plans for iran '' `` as usual with his quarterly pieces , we 'll decline to comment , '' white house spokesman gordon johndroe told cnn . `` the cia , as a rule , does not comment on allegations regarding covert operations , '' cia spokesman paul gimigliano said . ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad , denied u.s. raids were being launched from iraq , where american commanders believe iran is stoking sectarian warfare and fomenting attacks on u.s. troops . `` i can tell you flatly that u.s. forces are not operating across the iraqi border into iran , in the south or anywhere else , '' crocker said . hersh said u.s. efforts were staged from afghanistan , which also shares a border with iran . he said the program resulted in `` a dramatic increase in kinetic events and chaos '' inside iran , including attacks by kurdish separatists in the country 's north and a may attack on a mosque in shiraz that killed 13 people . the united states has said it is trying to isolate iran diplomatically in order to get it to come clean about its nuclear ambitions . but bush has said `` all options '' are open in dealing with the issue . iran insists its nuclear program is aimed at providing civilian electric power , and refuses to comply with u.n. security council demands that it halt uranium enrichment work . u.n. nuclear inspectors say tehran held back critical information that could determine whether it is trying to make nuclear weapons . israel , which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , conducted a military exercise in the eastern mediterranean in early june involving dozens of warplanes and aerial tankers . the distance involved in the exercise was roughly the same as would be involved in a possible strike on the iranian nuclear fuel plant at natanz , iran , a u.s. military official said . in 1981 , israeli warplanes destroyed an iraqi nuclear reactor . iran 's parliament speaker , ali larijani , warned other countries against moves that would `` cost them heavily . '' in comments that appeared in the semi-official mehr news agency sunday , an iranian general said his troops were digging more than 320,000 graves to bury troops from any invading force with `` the respect they deserve . '' `` under the law of war and armed conflict , necessary preparations must be made for the burial of soldiers of aggressor nations , '' said maj. gen. mirfaisal baqerzadeh , an iranian officer in charge of identifying soldiers missing in action . journalist shirzad bozorghmehr in tehran , iran , contributed to this report .
760	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- after wrapping up the longest presidential primary campaign in modern history , sen. hillary clinton said tuesday that she is ready to turn her attention back to being the junior senator from new york . sen. hillary clinton is greeted with cheers as she returns to the senate after a two-week vacation . `` i look forward to being back with this great team , '' she said as she returned to the senate at the end of a two-week vacation , taken after she conceded the 17-month-long primary contest to sen. barack obama . the second-term new york democrat pledged to `` immerse myself in there , '' pointing to the chamber . she had just emerged from the party 's weekly luncheon , which senate majority leader harry reid called `` one of the most emotional caucuses '' he 's ever attended on capitol hill . he said the new york senator entered the event to a sea of high fives , cheers and a standing ovation from her democratic colleagues . clinton said the opportunity to run for the oval office allowed her to `` immerse myself in the extraordinary resilience and resourcefulness that is the american people . '' watch clinton being greeted with cheers '' `` i come back with an even greater depth of awareness about what we have to do here in washington , '' she said . `` so many of the concerns that people have expressed to me over the course of this campaign are ones that they ca n't individually solve . they ca n't even really take it on just at the state or local level . '' clinton said that in addition to working `` very hard to elect sen. obama our president , '' she plans to campaign on behalf of democratic senate candidates . `` we have been unfortunately stymied by the stalling tactics '' of republicans , she said , noting the need for 60 votes to get any legislation passed in the senate . `` it 's going to be up to the democratic party , and particularly the democratic senate , to make progress on everything from health care and the economy to ending the war in iraq , '' she said . `` i look forward to being back with this great team that we have here and doing everything i can to make that happen . '' clinton said she is not spending time on the possibility that she may be asked to fill the no. 2 spot on sen. barack obama 's presidential ticket . `` you know , it is not something that i think about , '' she said . `` this is totally sen. obama 's decision , and that 's the way it should be . '' but she made clear , as she tried to do in her ultimate concession speech june 7 , that her supporters should not stray toward john mccain , no matter any hard feelings left over from a bruising primary . `` anyone who voted for me has very little in common with the republican party , '' she said . thursday night , obama and clinton are set to meet with key donors in washington . the next day , the two will appear jointly in unity , new hampshire , a small town on that state 's western border where the two candidates tied in the january primary . `` this is going to be a symbolic event that i hope will rally the democratic party behind the nominee , '' she said . obama said he looked forward to working with clinton and her husband , former president clinton , on his campaign for the white house . `` bill clinton is one of the most intelligent , charismatic political leaders that we have seen in a generation , and he has got a lot of wisdom to impart , '' obama said tuesday . `` we are going to be working very closely with him and sen. clinton to make sure that we not only win in november , but we actually govern in a way that delivers on the promise of universal health care , good jobs and good wages , clean energy , lower gas prices , the things that are really going to make an impact on people 's lives , '' he said . watch obama discuss clintons ' role '' obama said the senator 's presidential campaign had `` enhanced '' her stature in a way that would bolster her efficacy in the senate . `` she garnered not just votes but passion and support of so many millions of people , '' obama said . `` she 's going to be a force to be reckoned with not only in the senate , but hopefully , if i 'm successful in the white house , she 's going to be one of my key partners in making sure that were moving forward on issues like healthcare that she cares so deeply about . '' at an event in riverside , california , sen. john mccain , the presumptive republican presidential nominee , said clinton is probably returning to the senate with greater political clout . `` i think , if i had to guess , that the fact that the she ran an honorable and incredibly long and dedicated campaign for the nomination of her party would indicate to me that she would probably return to the united states senate with enhanced prestige and enhanced influence , '' mccain said . he also praised clinton for her work on military matters since joining the legislative body in 2001 . `` i think that sen. clinton has already attained a position of leadership in the united states senate , '' he said . `` she works hard at her job . she is a very important member of the armed services committee , and i have worked together with her on a variety of national security issues . '' mccain is working hard to persuade clinton supporters to back his campaign . cnn 's bob costantini , lisa desjardins , alex mooney and peter hamby contributed .
761	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- britain 's prince william has helped the u.s. coast guard bust a drug smuggling boat carrying cocaine worth a minimum of $ 80 million . prince william has helped bust a speed boat smuggling $ 80 million worth of cocaine . william , who is serving in the royal navy , helped make the bust last weekend when he spotted a speedboat found to be carrying nearly a ton of cocaine in the atlantic ocean , britain 's ministry of defense said wednesday . william , 26 , was one of the crew members aboard a helicopter attached to the frigate hms iron duke who spotted the ocean-going speedboat hundreds of miles northeast of barbados , the defense ministry said . the 50-foot-long power boat raised suspicions because it was a small vessel far out to sea and resembled a `` go-fast '' boat commonly used for drug smuggling , the ministry said . the boat 's location suggested it was en route to europe or north africa , it said . the chopper 's crew informed the ship 's captain about the boat , and u.s. coast guard personnel who were on the frigate then boarded the boat . they found 45 bales of cocaine weighing a total of 900 kilograms -lrb- just under a ton -rrb- , the defense ministry said . the cocaine has a minimum street value of $ 80 million , the ministry said . the bust went smoothly with no violence , defense officials said . navy crew detained the five men on the boat , which was in poor condition and later sank . william is in the middle of a two-month attachment with the royal navy as part of his continued experience with various branches of the military . the prince , who is called sub lieutenant wales in the navy , is also expected to spend time aboard a mine hunter and submarine during his attachment , which ends august 1 . william 's vessel , the iron duke , is a patrol boat which supports overseas british territories in the event of a hurricane and carries out counter-narcotic operations . william completed a four-month attachment with the royal air force earlier this year and received his pilot 's wings on graduation in april . he learned to fly three different aircraft during the attachment and is known as flying officer wales within the raf . william is already a second lieutenant in the british army , where he serves in the blues and royals regiment of the household cavalry . the attachments are designed to give the prince , who as king will be the head of the armed forces , experience with the military .
762	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- senate republicans on tuesday blocked a democratic initiative that would have taxed the windfall profits oil companies have enjoyed due to rising energy prices , with the minority leader calling the proposal a `` gimmick . '' record energy prices have led to record profits for oil companies . the measure failed to achieve the 60 votes required by senate rules to proceed . the vote was 51-43 . six republicans , including three seeking re-election in november , broke ranks to support the bill . two democrats -- sen. mary landrieu of oil-producing state louisiana and majority leader harry reid , who voted no to be able to bring the measure back to the floor under senate rules -- voted against the measure . along with placing a special tax of 25 percent on oil companies , the bill would have permitted lawsuits against the organization of petroleum exporting countries , the oil-producing cartel , and suspended deposits into the strategic petroleum reserve . profits from renewable energy sources would be excluded from the tax . `` we 're not afraid , on this side , to go after big oil when they are not doing the right thing , '' said sen. charles schumer , d-new york . `` and we are not afraid to go after opec because they are a cartel that squeezes us . `` we 're not afraid to do some strong tough things that will -- some in the short run , some in the longer run -- that will bring down the price , the all too high price , of gasoline . '' sen. byron dorgan , d-north dakota , said the measure was needed to `` wring out '' speculators he blamed for driving the price of crude oil to more than $ 130 a barrel in recent weeks . but senate republicans insisted the new taxes ultimately would hurt consumers and cut american oil supply , saying democrats simply were playing election-year politics . the bill is `` pure and simple a pathetic attempt to even call itself an energy plan , '' said sen. kay bailey hutchison , r-texas . senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said , `` hitting the gas companies might make for good campaign literature or evening news clips , but it wo n't address the problem . this bill is n't a serious response to gas prices . it is just a gimmick . '' the kentucky republican added , `` they are hoping the idea of going after energy companies will create the illusion of action after a week in which they themselves fought for a bill that would make the problem worse . what a political charade . '' as the average cost of gas edged above $ 4 a gallon , high prices are definitely on the minds of voters . a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released tuesday shows 40 percent of respondents are more concerned about the cost of gasoline than long lines at the pump , which occurred during the energy crisis of the 1970s . but 55 percent of those surveyed are more worried about the long lines and rationing . the poll results reflect telephone interviews with 1,035 adults on wednesday and thursday . the margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points . cnn 's ted barrett , lisa desjardins , matt smith , virginia nicolaidis and scott j. anderson contributed to this report .
763	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush on monday signed a bill that will pay for the wars in iraq and afghanistan through the remainder of his presidency and into spring 2009 . president bush on monday said the men and women of the armed forces deserve `` our unflinching support . '' the supplemental spending bill provides nearly $ 162 billion in war funding without the restrictions congressional democrats vowed to put into place since they took control of congress nearly two years ago . after signing the bill , bush said the men and woman of the armed services are owed `` our unflinching support , and the best way to demonstrate that support is to give them the resources they need to do their jobs and to prevail . '' bush also said he appreciated that `` republicans and democrats in congress agreed to provide these vital funds without tying the hands of our commanders and without an artificial timetable of withdrawal from iraq . '' watch as bush thanks congress '' `` this bill shows the american people that even in an election year , republicans and democrats can come together to stand behind our troops and their families , '' bush said . he also touted the success of the `` surge '' strategy he implemented last year . `` our troops have driven the terrorists and extremists from many strongholds in iraq . today , violence is at the lowest level since march of 2004 , '' he said . `` as a result of this progress , some of our troops are coming home , as a result of our policy called ` return on success . ' we welcome them home . '' white houses spokeswoman dana perino called the bill a victory for the president . `` because we have seen success in the surge , perhaps congress decided that it was ok to allow the commander in chief to be able to move forward as he saw fit , '' said perino , noting the $ 162 billion was the same amount that the president had requested . the supplemental spending bill also contains a new gi bill that expands education benefits for veterans who have served since the 9/11 attacks , provides a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits and more than $ 2 billion in disaster assistance for parts of the midwest that have been hit by record floods . the signing comes two weeks before the deadline that defense secretary robert gates had established for the funds . gates said he would consider laying off defense department employees to balance the pentagon 's books if legislation was not signed by july 15 . watch a progress report from the u.s. ambassador to iraq '' house democrats had tried to include restrictions on war funding when they drafted the bill , but they were unable to overcome procedural hurdles that republicans put up . a compromise version of the supplemental bill was later negotiated between democratic and republican leaders that included the war funding along with the gi bill , unemployment benefits and disaster relief -- three top legislative priorities for the democrats that bush and congressional republicans originally resisted . `` at a time when 2 million men and women have fought in iraq and afghanistan and when our troops have had to endure multiple deployments , stop-loss policies , insufficient equipment and an unclear strategy , giving them the opportunity to fuel our future economy is the least we can do , '' senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said of the gi bill after the senate sent it to the president 's desk thursday night . congressional democrats regained control of the house of representatives and senate after the 2006 midterm elections in large part to due to displeasure over the iraq war . but democrats -- lacking the 60 votes to overcome gop filibusters in the senate , let alone the two-thirds majorities in both the house and senate to override a presidential veto -- have been unable to pass significant restrictions on war funding because republicans , for the most part , have stuck with bush on the war .
764	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. barack obama defended his patriotism monday , telling a crowd in independence , missouri , that his `` deep and abiding love for this country '' is the reason he is running for president . sen. barack obama 's speech on patriotism comes days before the fourth of july . `` at certain times over the last 16 months , i have found , for the first time , my patriotism challenged -- at times as a result of my own carelessness , more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears and doubts about who i am and what i stand for , '' he said in president harry truman 's hometown , just days before the fourth of july . obama vowed to never question the patriotism of others in the campaign , adding `` i will not stand idly by when i hear others question mine . '' obama has been defending his patriotism ever since the beginning of the primary season , when he was first criticized for not wearing a flag pin -- which he now does much more frequently -- and when false rumors began circulating that he did not say the pledge of allegiance . watch excerpts of obama 's speech '' a widely distributed photo also seemed to show him failing to place his hand over his heart during a rendition of `` the star-spangled banner . '' obama 's wife , michelle , also was criticized about her patriotism , after telling an audience at a campaign event , `` for the first time in my adult lifetime , i 'm really proud of my country . '' obama 's campaign said she was just excited about the campaign 's grassroots support , but her words still provided fodder for her husband 's opponents . at his appearance monday , barack obama appealed to unity . `` given the enormous challenges that lie before us , we can no longer afford these sorts of divisions , '' he said . `` none of us expect that arguments about patriotism will , or should , vanish entirely ; after all , when we argue about patriotism , we are arguing about who we are as a country , and more importantly , who we should be . `` but surely , we can agree that no party or political philosophy has a monopoly on patriotism . and surely , we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that , however rough and imperfect , captures the best of america 's common spirit . '' obama said that for him , `` patriotism starts as a gut instinct , a loyalty and love for country that 's rooted in some of my earliest memories . '' obama described how as he grew up , his patriotism matured to something that `` would survive my growing awareness of our nation 's imperfections : its ongoing racial strife ; the perversion of our political system that were laid bare during the watergate hearings ; the wrenching poverty of the mississippi delta and the hills of appalachia . '' obama said he learned that `` what makes america great has never been its perfection , but the belief that it can be made better . '' patriotism , he said , must involve the willingness to sacrifice . he called attention to the service of john mccain , the presumptive republican candidate . mccain 's campaign has been calling on obama to condemn comments from retired gen. wesley clark , who said this weekend that mccain 's service in vietnam did not necessarily mean that he was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief . read about what clark said . clark is a military adviser for obama . in his speech monday , obama did not directly address clark 's comments , but after calling attention to mccain 's service , he said `` no one should ever devalue that service , especially for the sake of a political campaign , and that goes for supporters of both sides . '' `` we must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform . period , '' he said . just as obama was finishing his speech , his campaign released a statement about clark 's remarks . `` as he 's said many times before , sen. obama honors and respects sen. mccain 's service , and of course he rejects yesterday 's statement by gen. clark , '' obama campaign spokesman bill burton said . meanwhile , mccain 's campaign announced monday it was launching a new truth squad to defend the arizona senator 's military record . leaders of the latest group include mccain 's fellow vietnam prisoners of war air force col. bud day and marine lt. col. orson swindle , along with former navy pilot carl smith , who served with him . mccain said monday he was proud of his record of service . watch mccain 's response to clark 's comments '' `` the important thing is that if that 's the kind of campaign that sen. obama and his surrogates and his supporters want to engage in , i understand that , '' he said . `` but it does n't reduce the price of a gallon of gas by one penny . it does n't achieve our energy independence or make it come any closer ... and it certainly does n't do anything to address the challenges that americans have in keeping their jobs , their homes and supporting their families . '' obama was to follow up monday 's speech on patriotism with an address tuesday about faith and remarks later in the week on service . he will spend his fourth of july in butte , montana , campaigning with his family . mccain on monday was campaigning in pennsylvania , a battleground state in the general election . he was scheduled to speak with reporters in harrisburg before holding a town hall meeting in pipersville . mccain leaves for colombia on tuesday and will travel to mexico later in the week . his campaign on monday unveiled his new campaign airplane , a boeing 737-400 . the aircraft shares its name -- the `` straight talk express '' with mccain 's campaign bus , which has been a staple of the candidate 's 2000 and 2008 campaigns . the 95-seat plane -- with seats for the candidate , his staffers and the press -- has the `` straight talk express '' logo emblazoned on its fuselage . cnn 's tasha diakides and chris welch contributed to this report .
765	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- bangladesh police have detained or arrested more than 18,000 people in the last 11 days in a crackdown on crime they say is aimed at improving security ahead of december elections . people arrested by bangladesh police in their latest round-up arrive at a jail in dhaka . human rights groups decry the actions as politically motivated . the round-ups began may 28 , days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections . police told cnn that by saturday 16,916 arrests had been made , while local media reported another 1,548 were arrested sunday . the awami league and the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody . `` the timing and targets of the arrests are a dead giveaway they are politically motivated , '' brad adams of the new york-based human rights watch said in a statement . `` it 's obvious that they are paying the price for the political parties ' refusal to accept the government 's conditions to participate in the elections . '' the government rejects the allegations . the detentions , it said , are part of a planned sweep to rid the country of criminals . `` our igp -lsb- inspector general of police , or chief of police -rsb- categorically said this special drive was being conducted to create a congenial atmosphere before the general election , '' said kamrul ahsan , a spokesman for bangladesh police . `` it is not politically motivated , '' he said . `` the intention is not to harass anybody politically . '' the crackdown began after the awami league and the bnp said they would not cooperate with the government to develop a roadmap toward democracy unless it first releases the parties ' leaders . the two women who head the parties -- sheikh hasina of the awami league and khaleda zia of the bnp -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges . hasina is charged with bribe-taking . zia is being held on charges of graft for improperly awarding a multi-million dollar government contract . the current political crisis in the muslim-majority south asian country of 150 million can be traced , in large part , to the lingering animosity between the two women , political observers say . their rivalry runs so deep that the women are known in the country as the `` battling begums . '' begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country . since the country 's independence in 1972 , the awami league or the bnp has ruled bangladesh for all but eight years . both women have served as prime minister at one point or another . after its last stint in power ended in 2006 , the bnp handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections , as mandated by the country 's constitution . but the awami league refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government . hasina accused zia of stocking it with bnp backers . supporters and party members took to the streets in months of deadly clashes . to stem the tide of violence , a military-backed government took control in january 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency . it also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country 's graft-ridden politics . the caretaker government adopted the emergency powers rules . the rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime , human rights watch said . a wave of detentions followed . by some estimates more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes . among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians , including hasina and zia -- leading to the current political stalemate . the government wants to hold elections in the third week of december , and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting . the political parties allege the arrests are intended to pave the way for the election of pro-government candidates . they want their leaders set free before they sit down and talk with the government about a roadmap toward a successful election . they also threatened to organize mass movements to secure their leaders ' release . `` it 's kind of an impasse , '' said taleya rehman , founder and executive director of the bangladesh-based non-profit democracy watch . `` the government is conducting political dialogue with small parties . but they are of no significance . they need the two major parties . '' on monday , the government announced it was releasing hasina from custody on medical grounds so she can go abroad for treatment . a similar release for zia was also expected . party members say the government 's move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country . hasina has a damaged ear resulting from a bombing attack that targeted her four years ago . zia is believed to have arthritis . meanwhile , the detentions continue -- almost 1,800 a day . in addition to political party members , the crackdown has also swept up several journalists . `` that actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people 's minds , '' said sultana kamal , executive director of the legal aid group , ain o salish kendro -lrb- law and adjudication center -rrb- . `` if you just arrest any tom , dick and harry saying this person may have arms , then people will legitimately raise questions about the mode of the whole operation .

'' court documents released friday say carson was kidnapped from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with atm access to her bank account before she was shot to death in the early hours of march 5 . the documents -- applications for search warrants -- say a confidential informant told police in the days after the death that atwater had told her he and lovette had entered carson 's home through an open door and forced carson to accompany them in her car . the informant said she had talked with atwater after a picture was displayed on television showing someone attempting to use carson 's atm card at a convenience store two days after carson 's body was found . the informant said the two men drove carson to an atm , obtaining her pin number from her . `` the cw -lsb- informant -rsb- learned that carson was forced into the back seat with atwater , and lovette drove carson 's vehicle , '' the court documents said . `` that information is consistent with video footage taken from an atm camera on that date . '' the witness told police atwater said the two got about $ 1,400 from carson 's account . bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period , the documents said . and the informant said that both suspects shot carson , according to one of the affidavits . `` this information was corroborated by crime scene search information that two separate weapons were used in the homicide , '' the documents said . the documents said police believe carson was subjected to a sexual assault `` of an unknown nature '' and asked for a search warrant to collect dna swabs from the suspects . but orange county , north carolina , district attorney jim woodall told cnn friday the collection and testing done on carson 's body was routine , and authorities do not believe she was sexually assaulted . prosecutors had fought to keep her autopsy sealed . following a motion by the raleigh news & observer newspaper , prosecutors agreed to allow the report 's release . carson , a native of athens , georgia , was a pre-medicine student double-majoring in political science and biology . she was a recipient of the university 's prestigious morehead scholarship and a member of the phi beta kappa honor society , unc has said .
778	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. food and drug administration tuesday ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add a `` black box '' label warning -- the fda 's strongest -- to alert patients of possible tendon ruptures and tendonitis . cipro is one of the drugs for which the fda will require a `` black box '' label warning about tendon problems . `` the new language will strengthen the existing warnings , '' said dr. edward cox , director of the fda 's office of antimicrobial products . the fda is requiring the label warnings and a medication guide for fluoroquinolone drugs , which include cipro , levaquin , avelox , noroxin and floxin . the consumer group public citizen asked the fda in august 2006 to put the `` black box '' warning on cipro and other fluoroquinolones , and also to warn doctors . earlier this year , public citizen filed a lawsuit to force the fda to take those actions . public citizen said tuesday it was `` pleased '' with the fda 's order but added `` there is still more that the fda must do . '' `` the fda is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions , such as tendon pain , so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture , '' the group said . `` we are troubled that the fda is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures . '' when asked about the lawsuit and why it did n't order the `` black box '' label warning until now , cox stressed that the fda included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004 , and updated the information last year . dr. gupta explains more on antibiotic risks '' `` there has been ongoing work to update the labeling of the fluoroquinolone drug products , '' cox said . `` we have been working on this issue and making progress over time . '' the companies that make the fluoroquinolone drugs will be required to submit label safety changes and the medication guide within 30 days of receiving the notification from the fda or provide a reason why they do not believe such labeling changes are necessary , cox said . bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc. , which holds licenses for cipro and avelox , said it would make the changes requested by the fda but defended the drugs as `` well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications . '' schering-plough markets cipro and avelox in the united states under agreement with bayer . ortho-mcneil-janssen pharmaceuticals , which markets levaquin in the united states , also said it would abide by the fda 's request . merck & co. , the maker of noroxin , said it , too , would update the drug 's label . but merck noted it has stopped promotion of noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form . oscient pharmaceuticals -lrb- factive -rrb- , daiichi sankyo -lrb- floxin -rrb- and dipomed -lrb- proquin -rrb- did not immediately respond to cnn 's requests for comment . the fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times , according to the fda 's dr. renata albrecht . `` this risk is further increased in those over age 60 , in kidney , heart , and lung transplant recipients , and with use of concomitant steroid therapy , '' the fda said in a statement . albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their achilles tendon . `` sometimes it 's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning , '' she said . normally , she added , that patients experience some pain or inflammation `` a week or two before the patient will rupture . '' public citizen , founded in 1971 by consumer activist ralph nader , said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between november 1997 and december 2007 . `` because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the fda , the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher , '' the group said . the fda would only say that it has received `` hundreds '' of reports of tendon problems linked to fluoroquinolones , without being more specific , citing the ongoing lawsuit . but cox said `` the fda continues to receive a considerable number of reports on tendon adverse effects . '' patients should stop taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics at the first sign of tendon pain , avoid exercise and contact their doctor , the fda said . cox said the fda would not require companies to send letters to doctors alerting them about the connection between tendon problems and the antibiotics . `` it is possible under rems -lsb- risk evaluation and mitigation strategy -rsb- to ask for a letter -lsb- to doctors -rsb- , '' cox said . `` certainly for sponsors that would choose to go forward with a letter , we 'll be happy to work with them .

782	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- north korea 's apparent cooperation with nations seeking to end its nuclear weapons ambitions -- six years after a deal collapsed and two years after testing a bomb -- may lead to questions about why it would play ball now . some signs show north korean leader kim jong il does intend to drop his nuclear weapon program , experts say . one school of thought : the communist nation , in desperate economic straits , has long been willing to drop its program for better relations with the united states . but mistakes on both sides interfered , according to jim walsh , a national security analyst . north korea could be trying to achieve survival through deceit , intending to keep its nuclear weapons as blackmail for better treatment , analysts suggest . but those making a case for north korea 's sincerity , walsh said , would say it must `` do the things economically that -lsb- it needs -rsb- to do to avoid collapse . '' `` having nuclear weapons when the regime is collapsing wo n't do them much good , '' said walsh , a research associate at the massachusetts institute of technology . north korea , following a 2007 agreement with five nations including the u.s. , handed over a declaration of its nuclear program on thursday . the nation also took steps to disable a reactor that officials acknowledge helped extract plutonium to build nuclear weapons . on friday , it destroyed the reactor 's cooling tower -- significant because the tower would take a year or longer to rebuild . watch the tower being demolished . '' after north korea 's declaration , president bush said thursday that he intends to move north korea from the u.s. list of states that sponsor terrorism . down the line , north korea would receive economic and energy assistance if the u.s. and other nations agree it is complying with other efforts to dismantle its nuclear program . north korea has been heavily sanctioned in the past because of its nuclear program . stephen hadley , the u.s. national security adviser , told reporters thursday that the terror list was one incentive for north korea to drop its nuclear ambitions . `` i think it is important to them not to be on a list that says ` enemies ' and not to be on a list that says ` supporters of terror , ' '' hadley said . walsh said north korea has been weakened by sanctions and its lack of arable land , leading to a population unable to feed itself . `` it ca n't grow enough food , '' walsh said . `` and they 've got to attract foreign investors . '' he said north korea was better off in the days of the soviet union , when it had an ample amount of communist nations with which to trade . but the soviet union collapsed , and many other nations turned away from communism , leaving north korea increasingly isolated . `` geostrategically , north korea was growing weaker , and everyone around them was growing stronger , '' walsh said . in 1994 , north korea pledged to the u.s. that it would freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid , including help building two power-producing nuclear reactors . by 2000 , however , north korea was complaining that not all the aid was coming as promised . in 2002 , the u.s. accused north korea of working on a secret nuclear weapons program , and the u.s. said north korea admitted doing so . countries including the u.s. halted oil supplies , and north korea withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty . it conducted an underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 . walsh said both sides have n't fully lived up to previous agreements . the u.s. , he said , promised normalized trade at one point but did n't follow through . jon wolfsthal , senior fellow of the center for strategic and international studies ' international security program , said north korea has been `` remarkably consistent '' regarding its reactions to u.s. positions . `` when we 've engaged them directly , they have responded . and when we have reduced our commitment , to our engagement ... they have responded negatively , '' wolfsthal said . wolfsthal said china -- which provides oil and food aid to north korea -- has been instrumental in getting north korea to cooperate . `` china has gone from being an uninvested ... mediator to being a true participant in this process -- from a country that originally wanted to help the u.s. and north korea work out their differences to a state that has worked to convince north korea to meet its obligations , '' wolfsthal said . wolfsthal said he believes china was embarrassed by north korea 's nuclear test , and shifted course . `` i think that over time , the united states has helped china see that north korea 's unpredictable behavior destabilizes their own backyard , '' he said . walsh and wolfsthal said another theory has it that north korea is only playing with negotiators and intends to keep its nuclear program and weapons as a security blanket . expanding on that possibility , wolfsthal said north korea leader kim jong il could keep the country 's nuclear arsenal but agree not to produce any more nuclear weapons . `` everybody 's speculating . none of us has met kim jong il , '' wolfsthal said . walsh said the west does n't have hard evidence to determine north korea 's intentions . `` but so far , the evidence is pretty strongly on the side of north korea wanting a real bargain , '' walsh said .
783	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- actress gina gershon is demanding a retraction from vanity fair after the magazine reported `` high-end hollywood dinner-party gossip '' that former president clinton `` has been seen visiting '' her in california . actress gina gershon `` is extremely offended '' by the vanity fair article , her lawyers say . the lengthy article by the magazine 's national editor , todd purdum , mentioned the actress along with several other women rumored to be associated with clinton , all anonymously sourced . `` todd purdum 's insinuation is a lie , and it is irresponsible journalism , '' said gershon 's publicist , mara buxbaum . `` we are demanding a retraction . '' a letter sent by gershon 's attorneys to vanity fair editor-in-chief graydon carter , obtained by cnn , demanded a published correction and retraction and threatened possible litigation for defamation . the actress appeared in 1995 's `` showgirls '' and the more recent `` p.s. i love you . '' gershon `` is extremely offended by the false and defamatory inference that she engaged in an adulterous relationship with the president , '' the letter says , adding that the actress has been in the same room with clinton three times , always in the presence of at least a dozen people . `` it is apparent that vanity fair was intent upon publishing unsubstantiated rumors , and that it avoided learning the true facts so that the truth would not get in the way , '' the letter says . `` such conduct is reckless and malicious , giving rise to substantial liability for defamation . '' in a statement , vanity fair denied that the article indicates any `` improper relationship '' between clinton and gershon . `` the story merely examines the concerns of some of clinton 's aides about reports of his behavior , '' the magazine said . `` we do n't believe that any correction is warranted . '' purdum 's article , `` the comeback id , '' quoted multiple anonymous sources questioning the former president 's behavior since leaving the white house . the article suggested that clinton 's personality had changed since his 2004 heart bypass surgery and said there were reports of clinton `` seeing a lot of women on the road . '' clinton issued a tirade against purdum on monday when asked by huffington post writer mayhill fowler what he thought of `` the hatchet job somebody did on you in vanity fair , '' according to a recording of the exchange posted on the huffington post 's web site . '' -lsb- he 's -rsb- sleazy , '' clinton responded . `` he 's a really dishonest reporter . '' clinton said that he had not read the article but that he was told that `` there 's five or six just blatant lies in there . but he 's a real slimy guy . '' calling purdum a `` scumbag , '' clinton said `` he 's one of the guys that propagated all those lies about whitewater for kenneth starr . he 's just a dishonest guy -- ca n't help it . '' purdum `` did n't use a single name , he did n't cite a single source in all those things he said , '' the former president said , adding that the article was `` part of the national media 's attempt to nail hillary for obama . `` anytime you read a story that slimes a public figure with anonymous quotes , it ought to make the bells go off in your head , '' he said . jay carson , a spokesman for hillary clinton 's campaign , said late monday that `` president clinton was understandably upset about an outrageously unfair article , but the language today was inappropriate , and he wishes he had not used it . '' purdum , a former new york times reporter who covered the clinton white house and is married to former clinton press secretary dee dee myers , defended his article on cnn 's `` the situation room '' on monday afternoon , saying he was `` very careful to say there is no clear-cut evidence that president clinton has done anything improper . '' `` i reject the notion that i 'm making an insinuation , '' purdum said . `` but i 'm very comfortable quoting the people i quote because i know who they are , and i know that they are very senior people who have known president clinton for a very long time and work for him at very high levels .

'' later on thursday , obama traveled to fairfax , virginia , to unveil a plan meant to increase women 's economic security . the plan includes a tax credit of up to $ 1,000 for families , an increase in the minimum wage and tax cuts to help working women pay for child care , among other provisions . clinton , who introduced obama , urged her supporters to back the illinois senator , saying , `` it is critical that we join forces . the democratic party is a family -- sometimes dysfunctional . '' watch clinton make her case for obama '' `` we shared this remarkable journey , and i could not be prouder to have this opportunity in front of so many of my friends and supporters to express my confidence in his candidacy and my commitment to ensuring that he will take the oath of office come next january 2009 , '' she said . obama , in turn , praised clinton for her historic presidential run , saying , `` while this campaign has shown us how far we have to go , we also know that because of what hillary accomplished , my daughters and yours look at america and themselves a little differently today . '' watch why obama and clinton are appearing together '' despite the public calls for unity , some of clinton 's supporters have been hesitant to fall in behind obama . with clinton 's debt yet to be paid off , some of her supporters are balking at the idea of donating to obama -- especially if he does not choose her to be his running mate . `` i certainly know there are lots of people who are withholding their money , '' said lynn forester de rothschild , one of clinton 's `` hill-raisers '' who raised over $ 100,000 for the former first lady . watch why some clinton backers are balking '' `` this is a hard decision for me personally because frankly i do n't like him . i feel like he is an elitist . i feel like he has not given me reason to trust him , '' rothschild said . that sentiment may be sending some clinton fans into sen. john mccain 's court . according to a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released last week , the number of clinton supporters who say they plan to defect to the republican presidential nominee 's camp is down from a month ago -- but numbers of those who say they plan to vote for obama are also down . rep. debbie wasserman schultz , d-florida , spent two days in new york this week with disaffected clinton supporters . `` it 's not unexpected that they would n't just automatically shift over to obama , because they 're not the typical democratic supporters that just automatically shift over , '' she said . `` they need to be wooed . they need to be won over .

787	buenos aires , argentina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- argentine farmers are planning their next move after the country 's president announced plans to fund a public works program with revenues from a controversial agrarian export tax . argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner has rejected demands for the repeal of an export tax . eduardo buzzi , president of the argentine agrarian federation , said the organization 's directory board will meet friday to discuss what steps it plans to take in response to president cristina fernandez de kirchner 's announcement . `` we call on farmers across the country to stay calm but to stay on the alert , '' the organization said on its web site tuesday . the 44 percent export tax , which applies to soybeans , wheat , corn and sunflower seeds , has caused a three-month-old standoff between the government and farmers . argentina is the world 's second-largest corn exporter and third-largest soybean exporter . on monday , farmers suspended roadblocks that had snarled traffic across the country , though reports indicated that groups in some rural areas were still blocking roads tuesday . kirchner has argued that the tax , which was implemented march 11 , pays for increases in seniors ' pensions and financial assistance for the poor . she has rejected the farmers ' demands for a repeal of the export tax as `` extortion . '' monday marked the first time kirchner revealed details of how the government plans to use profits from the tax , which has generated about u.s. $ 1.5 billion , to lift people out of poverty . `` it is impossible to attack the problem of the poor without distribution of revenue and without touching extraordinary profits , '' she said in a televised address . kirchner said the social redistribution program will include the construction of 30 hospitals and more than 300 health-care centers , as well as investments in the country 's rural roads and in housing . in an apparent criticism of the farmers , she lamented `` the reaction of some who refuse to contribute in the redistribution '' to `` those who have least . '' she apologized , however , at the close of her speech for offending anyone . analysts suggested that the tax was a `` strong attack '' on on the farmers and their arguments against it . claudio loser , a visiting senior fellow at the inter-american dialogue policy analysis center , said it could result in argentine society being `` less sympathetic to the farmers , '' noting that it was `` surprising '' that the government did n't come up with the plan until the tax was three months old . loser , who is from argentina , also predicted that a continuation of the tax would provoke farmers into not investing . externally , the standoff has had a two-pronged effect on argentina , he said . `` the conflict has resulted in a loss of market for argentina , '' he said , as other countries have gone elsewhere for products . loser also said foreign investors may be more reluctant to invest in argentina now . cnn 's carolina cayazzo and taylor gandossy contributed to this report .

'' in an editorial in the new york daily news , the democratic presidential hopeful also acknowledged her dwindling chances of winning the nomination , saying she is aware of `` the odds '' against her . headlined `` hillary : why i continue to run , '' the editorial began with an explanation of her reference to the assassination when she was speaking to the argus leader newspaper in south dakota . she said she was pointing out that presidential primary campaigns have continued into june . `` almost immediately , some took my comments entirely out of context and interpreted them to mean something completely different -- and completely unthinkable , '' she wrote . watch hillary 's camp insist the remark had nothing to do with obama '' clinton said the newspaper 's editor and bobby kennedy jr. issued statements arguing that was the meaning of her remark . no other member of the kennedy family has issued a public statement on the matter . `` i realize that any reference to that traumatic moment for our nation can be deeply painful -- particularly for members of the kennedy family , who have been in my heart and prayers over this past week , '' she said , in a reference to sen. edward kennedy 's diagnosis with brain cancer . `` and i expressed regret right away for any pain i caused . `` but i was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything i stand for -- and everything i am fighting for in this election . '' some people -- particularly a number of bloggers -- have suggested she was imagining the possibility that sen. barack obama , the likely nominee , could be assassinated . after clinton 's initial remarks to the newspaper were reported , the obama campaign issued a statement saying the comment `` was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign . '' but obama himself later said , `` i do n't think that senator clinton intended anything by it , '' and that `` we should put it behind us . '' clinton campaign chairman terry mcauliffe , in an interview sunday , criticized the obama campaign 's first move . `` it 's unfortunate -- a hyped-up press over memorial day weekend , the obama campaign inflaming it , tried to take these words out of context , '' he told `` fox news sunday . '' asked about the remark by obama himself , mcauliffe responded , `` that 's great , but friday they were all part of this process . the press secretary came out and attacked senator clinton and got it going so the story would be around for three days . '' howard wolfson , a clinton adviser , told cbs ' `` face the nation '' that the obama campaign 's first statement critical of clinton was `` unfortunate . '' but obama 's chief strategist david axelrod told abc 's `` this week '' that `` we take her at her word , '' and he added , `` we 're beyond that issue now , so certainly we 're not trying to stir the issue up . '' the program 's host , george stephanopoulos , noted that a member of obama 's staff sent to the media saturday a `` searing commentary '' by msnbc 's keith olbermann slamming clinton for her remark . `` mr. olbermann did his commentary and he had his opinion , '' axelrod responded , adding , `` as far as we 're concerned , this issue is done . '' on another front , axelrod slammed clinton for suggesting she leads obama in the popular vote . clinton has been making that argument , based on figures that include florida and michigan , even though obama took his name off the ballot in michigan and neither candidate campaigned in florida . the democratic party discounted both states ' primaries before they took place . `` it would take some very tortured math and tortured logic to say that she 's ahead in the popular vote , '' axelrod told abc . he added , `` this is n't ` american idol , ' ok ? this is a nominating process . we have rules . we elect delegates state by state . '' in her column , clinton said she believes she can still `` win on the merits . '' `` i am not unaware of the challenges or the odds of my securing the nomination -- but this race remains extraordinarily close , and hundreds of thousands of people in upcoming primaries are still waiting to vote , '' she wrote . she added that her parents `` did not raise me to be a quitter -- and too many people still come up to me at my events , grip my arm and urge me not to walk away before this contest is over . '' she also said she is running `` because i believe staying in this race will help unite the democratic party . i believe that if senator obama and i both make our case -- and all democrats have the chance to make their voices heard -- in the end , everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee . '' she repeated her vow to campaign for obama if he gets the nomination , and wrote , `` no matter what happens in this primary , i am committed to unifying this party . '' obama was in middleton , connecticut , where he was standing in for the ailing edward kennedy who was scheduled to deliver the commencement at wesleyan university . watch obama tell graduates they have an obligation '' the theme of obama 's speech was service , and the senator asked graduates to volunteer their time at home and abroad to fight poverty , preserve peace and protect the environment . `` but i hope you 'll remember , during those times of doubt and frustration , that there is nothing naive about your impulse to change this world , '' he said . `` because all it takes is one act of service -- one blow against injustice -- to send forth that tiny ripple of hope that robert kennedy spoke of .

'' suzan hubbard , director of the division of adult institutions , decided that susan atkins ' request should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration , said terry thornton , spokeswoman for the california department of corrections and rehabilitation . hubbard 's recommendation is advisory and will not necessarily prevent atkins ' release . the court -- not the department or the state board of parole hearings -- has the final say on whether atkins should be released , thornton said . `` they 're the only ones legally who can recall the sentence , '' she added . atkins , 60 , was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress sharon tate and four others . she had been incarcerated at the california institution for women in corona , california , but has been hospitalized since mid-march . her request is now before the board of parole hearings , which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting , thornton said . the next meeting is scheduled july 15 . atkins had been held for years at the corona prison , which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law , and sent her request to the corrections department . the board of parole hearings will receive public comment , discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation . the board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court . the court , based in los angeles , can either grant or deny atkins ' request . it also can recall her life sentence and resentence atkins to a lesser term , allowing for her to be paroled . in 2007 , the department received 60 compassionate release requests , thornton said . ten were approved . citing privacy rules , prison officials would not disclose the nature of atkins ' illness . her husband and attorney , james whitehouse , has been quoted as saying she has terminal brain cancer , according to a blog called manson family today . she also has had a leg amputated , the los angeles times has reported . atkins , known within the manson family as `` sadie mae glutz , '' has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times . she is california 's longest-serving female inmate . tate and three houseguests were slain in august 1969 by killers who burst into her benedict canyon home . a teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed . according to historical accounts of the murders , atkins stabbed tate , who was 8 1/2 months pregnant , and wrote the word `` pig '' in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband , director roman polanski . the following night , leno and rosemary labianca were slain in their home in the los feliz neighborhood of los angeles . the two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout los angeles . all of the killers remain behind bars . atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher gary hinman . atkins , like family leader charles manson , received a death sentence . her punishment was changed to life in prison when the california supreme court ruled the state 's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972 . atkins is a born-again christian , according to a web site maintained by her husband . during her incarceration , the site says , atkins has worked to help at-risk youth , victims of violent crimes and homeless children . last month , authorities dug for buried bodies at the inyo county , california , ranch where manson and his followers once lived , after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there . nothing was found , police said .

792	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- susan atkins , a terminally ill former charles manson follower convicted in the murder of actress sharon tate , on tuesday was denied a compassionate release from prison . susan atkins , califorina 's longest-serving female inmate , is shown in her most recent mug shot . atkins , 60 , has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated , her attorney said . in june , she requested the release , available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live . the california board of parole hearings ' decision -- posted tuesday on its web site -- came after a public hearing on atkins ' request . it means the request will not be forwarded to the los angeles superior court that sentenced atkins . the court would have had the final say on atkins ' release . her attorney , eric p. lampel , called the parole board 's decision `` unfortunate . '' '' -lsb- the board -rsb- ignored the vast majority of evidence presented , '' lampel said . `` there was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses . it apparently fell on deaf ears . '' known within the manson family as sadie mae glutz , atkins and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people , including tate , in august 1969 . according to historical accounts of the murder , atkins stabbed tate , who was eight months pregnant , and scrawled the word `` pig '' in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director roman polanski . by her own admission , atkins held tate down and rejected her pleas for mercy , stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times . atkins ' request roused long-dormant memories of the two-day killing spree that terrorized los angeles and left seven people dead . it polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who were n't -- over whether she should die behind bars . atkins told a 1993 parole board that tate pleaded for her unborn child 's life as she held her down . `` she asked me to let her baby live , '' atkins said . '' ... i told her i did n't have any mercy on her . '' three of tate 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage out back . atkins was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher gary hinman . one of the first people atkins confessed to was virginia graham , who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the manson family was responsible for the murders . graham said last month she believed atkins should die in prison . `` she showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy , none , '' graham said . `` so why should anybody show her mercy at this time ? '' sharon tate 's sister , debra , has staunchly opposed atkins ' release . `` she will be set free when judged by god , '' debra tate has said . `` it 's important that she die in incarceration . '' los angeles county district attorney steve cooley said monday he was strongly opposed to the release , saying in a letter to the board it would be `` an affront to people of this state , the california criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims . '' cooley noted in his letter that atkins was initially sentenced to death , like others in the manson family , including its leader , charles manson . their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972 , when the u.s. supreme court struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time . california gov. arnold schwarzenegger said tuesday he was also opposed to releasing atkins . `` i do n't believe in -lsb- compassionate release -rsb- , '' the governor told reporters . `` i think that they have to stay in , they have to serve their time . '' even if atkins is dying , schwarzenegger said , `` those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that i 'm not for the compassionate release . '' earlier , suzan hubbard , director of adult prisons in california , also recommended against granting atkins ' request . vincent bugliosi , who prosecuted atkins and other members of the manson family , said he supported her release , if only to save the state money . through monday , the cost for atkins ' medical care since she was hospitalized march 18 totaled more than $ 1.15 million , and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $ 308,000 , said california department of corrections and rehabilitation spokeswoman terry thornton . terminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release , records show . in 2007 , 60 such requests were made to the department , thornton has said . ten were approved . atkins , who has been incarcerated since 1971 , is california 's longest-serving female inmate . according to a web site maintained by her husband and attorney , james whitehouse , she is now a born-again christian . during her incarceration , the site says , atkins worked to help at-risk youth , violent crime victims and homeless children , among others . the web site does not mention atkins ' illness . lampel said last month atkins is paralyzed on one side . `` she can talk a little bit , '' lampel said . `` she ca n't sit up in bed without assistance , and obviously she ca n't walk around because she 's an amputee . '' atkins has expressed remorse for her crimes . `` i know the pain i caused mrs. tate , '' she said at a parole board hearing in 1985 . ln may , authorities dug for buried bodies at the inyo county , california , ranch where manson and his followers once lived , after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there . nothing was found , authorities said . cnn 's ted rowlands contributed to this report .

'' bush said he would raise concerns when he meets chinese president hu jintao at the olympics , but he was also `` looking forward to cheering the u.s. athletes . '' he said it was good for them `` to see their president waving that flag . '' japan 's prime minister yasuo fukuda also said he would attend the opening ceremony despite concerns about human rights in china that prompted some other european leaders to boycott the event . bush and fukuda took questions from reporters at the picturesque lakeside resort of toyako on the northern island of hokkaido , where the g-8 summit will begin monday . watch bush , first lady arrive in japan '' bush said he and fukuda discussed the united states ' recent decision to lift some sanctions against north korea and remove the communist nation from the state department 's list of state sponsors of terror . bush assured japan that the issue of north korea 's past kidnappings of japanese citizens will not be ignored by the united states . he told fukuda that he was `` fully aware of the sensitivity of the issue in your country '' and that `` the united states will not abandon you on this issue .

'' bush said north korea 's recent destruction of a water-cooling tower at its now-defunct nuclear facility and its declaration outlining its plutonium program are positive steps , but there are `` more to be taken . '' lifting sanctions would not weaken the pressure on north korea to be forthcoming on the abduction issue or in nuclear negotiations , the u.s. president said . bush said north korea remains the most sanctioned nation in the world and that `` delisting did not get rid of their sanctions .

'' the mine 's owner had insisted that earth movement detected at the time of the collapse had caused the disaster . but investigators found instead that the collapse caused the earth movement . `` it was not -- and i repeat , it was not -- a natural occurring earthquake , '' said the government 's top mine safety official , richard e. stickler . stickler , the acting assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health , said , `` pillars failed under excessive load and ejected coal very violently . '' stickler also said the mine 's operator `` was taking more coal than allowed from the barrier pillars and the floor . '' `` this dangerously weakened the strength of the roof support , '' stickler said . in addition to the six miners killed in the initial cave-in august 6 in northwest emery county , three would-be rescuers died 10 days later in a subsequent collapse . the bodies of the six miners killed in the initial collapse were never recovered . richard gates , the lead investigator for the government , said the pillars in the mine `` simply were not large enough to support the load . '' that resulted in a `` catastrophic failure of pillars over a broad area , '' as large as half a mile , he said . university of utah scientists said in june that the collapse was not the result of an earthquake . `` as seismologists , we 're as certain as we can be that the seismic event registered as a magnitude-3 .9 shock was due to the collapse of the mine and not a naturally occurring earthquake , '' said walter arabasz , director of the university 's utah seismograph stations , in a written statement . earlier this year , a labor department report criticized mine safety and health administration officials for approving plans for a risky mining technique , known as retreat mining , that was in use before the collapse . in the process , miners remove pillars of coal that support the roof of a chamber one by one , allowing the roof to collapse behind them . mine owner bob murray repeatedly denied in the days after the disaster that his company practiced retreat mining at crandall canyon . he later admitted that the practice had been used at the mine but said it was not being done at the time of the disaster .

807	new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president george w. bush called india 's prime minister thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the indian leader this week , a white house spokesman said . prime minister manmohan singh won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal . `` both leaders expressed their desire to see the u.s.-india civil nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible , '' gordon johndroe said . the phone call took place two days after indian prime minister manmohan singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of parliament . the vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that india was kowtowing to the u.s. . the tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by bush and singh a year ago . under the agreement , which will need to be approved by the u.s. congress , india would have access to u.s. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants . that would happen even though new delhi , which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998 , has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements . in return , india has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program , and it would allow the international atomic energy agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants . the plan would also expand u.s.-indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology . the plan was approved by india 's cabinet last year , and does not have to be ratified by the parliament . the leaders of india 's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in parliament -- have accused singh of surrendering india 's sovereignty to the united states with the deal . a no-confidence vote would have forced singh to resign , and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed . the congress party-led coalition has governed india since 2004 . tuesday 's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of singh 's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers . shortly after singh survived the vote , white house spokeswoman dana perino praised the deal as `` a good one for everybody . '' `` it 's good for india because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need , one that is nonpolluting and one that does n't emit greenhouse gas emissions , '' she said . `` and we think that we can move forward with this . if their legislature lets it move forward , then we can do the same here and then we 'll be able to get this wrapped up .

'' iraqi government spokesman ali al-dabbagh and the ministry 's adviser , basil abdul mahdi , are on their way to lausanne , switzerland , to meet with ioc officials , jaffer said . the ioc barred iraq from participating in the olympic summer games in beijing , china , citing what it said was government interference with iraq 's olympic movement . the ioc 's charter does not allow political interference . the ban stems from the iraqi government decision in may to suspend the country 's existing olympic committee and form a new entity . watch an official explain the decision '' but even as government representatives traveled to switzerland , jaffer said iraq was considering legal action against the ioc . `` we will revert to international courts with a complaint against the ioc ... to get iraq 's rights and the rights of the athletes , '' jaffer said . on friday , another iraqi government official said the country was doing what it could to reverse the ban , but acknowledged that `` chances are slim '' for a change . basam ridha al-husseini , an adviser to prime minister nuri al-maliki , told cnn the government has been in `` heavy negotiations '' with ioc officials through the asian olympic committee . `` the iraqi government will not give up on our participation , which is still needed by our people , '' he said in a phone interview from dubai . `` we are doing our best to stop the ban . ... the chances of that are slim , but we will persevere and hope it will happen . '' repeated attempts by cnn to reach the ioc press office in switzerland for comment were unsuccessful . but on thursday , ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau said the ioc in june suspended iraq 's national olympic committee after the government removed elected officials and put in people not recognized by the ioc . she said the ioc had proposed to the iraqi government that officials come to the ioc headquarters in lausanne , switzerland , `` to discuss possible solutions . '' `` we 're extremely disappointed with the situation , '' moreau said . `` the athletes have been ill-served by the government in iraq . '' iraq missed a wednesday deadline for the entry of athletes to compete in archery , judo , rowing and weightlifting , moreau said . she said there is a chance that track and field athletes could compete if the original committee is reinstated . the deadline for the track team to register is at the end of the month . jaffer , iraq 's sports minister , told cnn on friday that the ioc 's decision was `` unjust '' because it did not take into consideration the iraqi government 's reasons for the may suspension . the minister called on the ioc to come to iraq and talk to the sports federation to investigate the political interference accusations , and then act accordingly . `` looking at this from far away , without going into the details , not reading the iraqi government 's reports , not hearing iraq 's side of the story and accusing iraq of many things is really unfortunate , '' he said . several iraqi athletes were to travel to china for the games ' start in august . iraqi sprinter dana hussain cried for hours after hearing the news of the ban on thursday , which arrived in the form of a letter to iraqi officials . `` she has n't stopped . it 's like finding out that a close relative has died , '' said her coach , yousif abdul rahman . abdul rahman attempted to console hussain by assuring her that she could compete in the 2012 olympics . watch hussain react to the news '' `` in this horrible situation , '' she said , `` who can say i 'll even be alive in 2012 ? '' al-husseini said iraq had the right as a sovereign nation to suspend the olympic committee , which he accused of documented corruption . it was not clear where the committee 's funds were going and they `` could be ending up in the hands of terrorists , '' he said . `` we are satisfied with the decision ... stand by it and we are not going to change an order by -lsb- prime minister -rsb- al-maliki and the cabinet . ... never , '' he said . he was asked whether iraq would consider doing what yugoslavia did in the 1992 winter olympics when it was banned -- sending individual athletes and not raising the national flag . al-husseini said that would be an option , but al-maliki rejected it . al-husseini said that iraq had been banned from taking part in the 1990 olympics during the saddam hussein-era because of the invasion of kuwait . the 1990 ban , enacted by the olympic council of asia , actually was a ban on participation in the asian games , a regional olympics-related event . iraq participated in the 1992 olympics in barcelona , the first games held after the kuwait invasion . cnn 's jomana karadsheh and morgan neill contributed to this report .

'' the republicans said they would not prevent the senate from taking up the housing bill passed earlier in the day by the house , although a final vote on that bill is not expected before the end of the week . democrats oppose republican measures to lift bans on offshore drilling and oil exploration in the arctic national wildlife reserve . see how gas prices have risen across the country '' republicans say the process would not be fair unless they can offer all of their amendments . sen. robert menendez , a new jersey democrat , accused the republicans of wanting to score political points rather than pass legislation . `` the problem with our republican colleagues is that they want to debate , not act . ... even when they are offered what they want , they say no . '' menendez suggested there was bipartisan support for measures meant to limit speculation , encourage conservation and provide tax credits for renewable energy . `` why would you not move forward on the items that you have consensus ? '' he asked . the disagreement between republicans and democrats could result in congress leaving washington for its monthlong recess in august without passing any measures to lower gas prices , which are averaging above $ 4 a gallon at the pump . experts have said lifting bans on drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and offshore would not affect the oil market for several years , but republicans have argued that the psychological effect of opening more areas for oil exploration would bring prices down . sen. byron dorgan , d-north dakota , one of the main sponsors of the bill , pleaded for republicans to help `` wring excessive speculation '' from the oil markets . he says speculation is responsible for 71 percent of the increase in a price of a barrel of oil this year . some analysts say speculation has added between $ 40 to $ 60 dollars to a barrel of oil . but other experts have questioned the extent to which speculators -- rather than basic market principles of supply and demand -- have driven up the price of oil . wednesday morning , a barrel of light , sweet crude was priced around $ 128 on the new york mercantile exchange , down from the $ 147 a barrel record set july 11 and the lowest price since june 5 . dorgan said ending speculation in the oil market would be a sensible first step toward lowering gas prices that both sides of the aisle could agree to . republicans `` have come up with a hundred excuses why they do n't want to do that , '' he said . but republicans say they want the opportunity to offer `` real '' solutions that will lower energy prices , which includes more drilling to expand domestic production . see what factors are driving up the price of oil '' `` the republicans know that american people want us to do something real , something big , something important about the price of gasoline , '' said sen. pete dominici , r-new mexico . `` and the only thing that we can do that is important is to release large quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are owned by american people and that have been locked up for 27 years in moratoria . '' dorgan , however , said the republicans are trying to suggest democrats are against additional domestic oil production , noting that there are millions of acres of federally controlled land and off-shore drilling sites that are open to exploration but have not been used by oil companies . `` it 's a false choice that the minority side says we should drill and that the majority side does n't , '' dorgan said . the bill in the senate would provide more resources and authority to the commodities futures trading commission to detect and punish speculation . it would help stop speculators from using foreign markets to manipulate the price of oil in the united states , require more transparency in oil markets and limit the trading of market players who do not intend to receive the oil they purchase . cnn 's ted barrett , debra krajnak and scott anderson contributed to this report .

811	phnom penh , cambodia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- cambodia has sent a letter to the united nations security council to call attention to its continuing standoff with thailand over an ancient border temple on disputed land . cambodian soldiers stand guard near preah vihear temple , close to the thai border . the country is not asking for u.n. intervention , said information minister kheu kanharith . rather , the letter that cambodia 's permanent mission in new york submitted to the chairmen of the security council and the general assembly is meant to draw attention to a crisis that entered its sixth day sunday . the two countries agreed to meet monday to defuse tensions -- even as each side continued to amass more troops to the site of the preah vihear temple . both cambodia and thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple , which sits atop a cliff on cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the thai side . the international court of justice awarded the temple to cambodia in 1962 . thailand claims , however , that the 1.8 square mile -lrb- 4.6 sq. km -rrb- area around it was never fully demarcated . thailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the cambodian government used a map drawn during the french occupation of cambodia that places both the temple and the surrounding area in that country 's territory . earlier this month , the united nations approved cambodia 's application to have the temple listed as a world heritage site -- places the u.n. says have outstanding universal value . the decision re-ignited tensions , with some in thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple . opposition parties in thailand used the issue to attack the government , which initially backed the heritage listing . a thai court overturned the pact , prompting the resignation of thailand 's foreign minister , noppadon pattama . he had endorsed the application . cambodia , meanwhile , is preparing for general elections on july 27 . and prime minister hun sen , who has been in power since the mid-1980s , has portrayed the u.n. recognition as a national triumph . the current flare-up began tuesday , when cambodian guards briefly detained three thais who crossed into the area . once they were let go , the three refused to leave the territory . cambodia claims thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers . thailand denies the charge , saying its troops are deployed in thai territory . each side has asked its troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon . so far , the only casualty has been a thai soldier who was injured tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the khmer rouge occupied the area . the khmer rouge , a radical communist movement that ruled cambodia from 1975 to 1979 , won power through a guerrilla war . it is remembered for the deaths of as many as 1.5 million cambodians . -- journalist soeum yin contributed to this report .
812	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- congress voted to halt planned cuts in medicare payments to doctors tuesday , overriding president bush 's veto in a battle that pitted health insurers against physicians . president bush says he objects to the bill because it takes choices `` away from seniors to pay physicians . '' the new law stops a 10.6 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors , part of a scheduled cost-saving formula that went into effect july 1 . the money for the doctors will be taken from the government-subsidized medicare advantage program , which the bush administration strongly supports . bush spiked the bill tuesday , telling lawmakers they would be `` taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians . '' `` i urge the congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in medicare spending , increases competition and efficiency , implements principles of value-driven health care and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending , '' he said in his veto message . the senate voted 70-26 to enact the law over bush 's objections , the third time in his presidency that congress has overridden his veto . the margin in the house of representatives was a lopsided 383-41 , well beyond the two-thirds majority needed . the american medical association lobbied heavily for the bill , warning that its members could be forced to curtail seeing medicare patients if the cuts went into effect . but insurers , which receive government subsidies to offer medicare advantage plans , warned that 2 million seniors could lose health benefits if it passed . a total of 21 senate republicans joined 47 democrats and two independents in the override vote . supporters broke a gop-led filibuster of the bill last week , aided by the dramatic return of sen. edward kennedy of massachusetts . kennedy 's vote came in his first appearance on the senate floor since surgery to remove a brain tumor in early june . though he did not vote tuesday , kennedy praised his colleagues for overriding the `` misguided '' veto . `` it 's a great vote , and a great day for america 's seniors , '' he said in a written statement . those republicans who opposed the bill argued that it would roll back many of the changes made to medicare in 2003 , when congress created privately run , government-subsidized prescription drug coverage and expanded the role of private insurers in other coverage . `` these are not pro-patient policies , '' said sen. jon kyl , r-arizona . `` rather , the bill reduces access , benefits and choices for medicare beneficiaries . '' but critics of the 2003 reforms say medicare advantage subsidies end up costing more than the government would pay to cover the same people through regular medicare , the federal health insurance program for seniors . the congressional budget office estimates that the bill will reduce federal spending by $ 12.5 billion by 2013 , largely by reducing medicare advantage enrollment . sen. patty murray , d-washington , said the bill also made `` vital improvements '' by supporting rural health care and lowering fees for mental health care . `` today , we can stand up for medicare , '' she said . `` we did it last week , when we came together and voted for this measure by a veto-proof margin , and i believe we can do it today by overriding that veto . '' congress had passed only two bills over bush 's objections : a $ 23 billion water-project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007 and a $ 300 billion farm bill he spiked in may . the medicare system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly americans . rising health care costs have made medicare a growing part of the federal budget , and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age . while the debate was raging over the bill , the ama said the cuts could lead to a `` meltdown '' of the government 's health care system for the elderly . a recent survey by the group found that 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new medicare patients they can take on if the cuts go into effect . `` we stand at the brink of a medicare meltdown . ... for doctors , this is not a partisan issue ; it 's a patient access issue , '' ama president nancy nielsen said in a statement after last week 's senate vote . the ama ran radio and tv ads over the july fourth congressional recess targeting 10 republican senators , seven of whom are up for re-election . the aarp , the nation 's largest organization of retired people , and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts . gerald harmon , a family physician who practices in pawleys island , south carolina , said the cuts could lead to doctors taking fewer medicare patients , making it difficult for the program 's elderly patients to get the care they need . `` this medicare access problem is a real issue , not just a political football , '' said harmon , who said 35 percent of his patients were eligible for medicare . `` it affects your dad when he 's sick . it affects my patients in my practice . this has to be addressed .

'' mrrg : `` a haunting experiment into the human psyche is the only way i can describe the unequivocal depth that ledger was able to reach with this portrayal of one the most evil characters ever brought to the screen . it was definitely bale 's story , but the late heath ledger 's movie . sonnyjc9 : wife and i watched this yesterday 17 july here in bangkok , thailand . heath ledger is awesome as the joker . 154 minutes of pure entertainment , and you will be giggling to yourself from heath 's performance . it is sad to think he will never reprise this role , but what a farewell . must see . zandz : we went to the premiere of this movie last night and thought the movie was only good . however , heath ledger did an excellent job portraying the the joker . the way heath ledger plays the joker is different than how jack nicholson plays the character . both have their unique styles -- nicholson 's joker was more comical , but ledger 's was more dark -lrb- while trying to be funny -rrb- . the makeup artists also did a great job on this joker 's face .

818	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states needs a new law requiring that the president consult with congress before going to war , a blue-ribbon panel led by two former secretaries of state said tuesday . james baker , left , and warren christopher led a panel that recommended a new war powers act . the current war powers resolution is `` ineffective , and it should be repealed and it should be replaced , '' james baker said in a joint appearance with warren christopher , announcing the results of the study they led . the recommendation follows failed efforts by democrats in congress to put a stop to the war in iraq or to put conditions on president bush 's conduct of it . congress passed a joint resolution to authorize armed force against iraq in 2002 , but some bush opponents say it should not have been interpreted as a blank check for the united states to invade and occupy the persian gulf nation . baker , who served in george h.w. bush 's administration , and christopher , who served under president bill clinton , said their project was not prompted by any specific war , with christopher adding that the commission had `` tried very hard not to call balls and strikes on past history here . '' `` we did n't direct this report at any particular conflict , '' baker added . the existing law , the war powers resolution of 1973 , has been regarded as unconstitutional by every president since it was passed as a response to the vietnam war , baker and christopher said . it requires presidents to report regularly to congress about ongoing conflicts , but the provision has been flouted . `` no president has ever made a submission to congress pursuant to the war powers resolution since 1973 , '' former sen. slade gorton , a republican member of the committee , said tuesday . the panel , formally called the national war powers commission , said a new law should be created requiring the president to consult with key members of congress before sending troops into combat expected to last more than a week , or within three days of doing so in the case of operations that need to be kept secret . it should also make clear exactly who the president needed to consult . the panel suggests that the president talk to `` a joint congressional committee made up of the leaders of the house and the senate as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees . '' the new committee would have a permanent professional staff with access to intelligence information , baker and christopher said . congress , in turn , would have to declare war or vote on a `` resolution of approval '' within 30 days , they said . if a resolution of approval failed , any member of congress could introduce a `` resolution of disapproval , '' but it was not clear that such an act would stop a war in progress . christopher was unable to say in the news conference what practical effect congressional disapproval would have . baker said the commission had been in touch with the presidential campaigns of democrat barack obama and republican john mccain , as well as leaders of congress . he declined to reveal what they thought of the proposal , but said : `` we have n't gotten a negative reaction . '' congress has not officially declared war since 1942 , when the united states entered formal hostilities with the axis powers in world war ii . but since then , presidents have sent troops into countries including korea , vietnam , grenada and iraq . the constitution makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces , but gives congress the power to declare war and approve military budgets . baker and christopher 's group included both republicans and democrats and held seven meetings over 14 months .
819	srinagar , indian-controlled kashmir -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- senior pakistani and indian military officials met tuesday to discuss a border clash in kashmir , the first major skirmish between south asia 's nuclear rivals since a 2003 cease-fire . indian army soldiers on the outskirts of kashmir 's summer capital srinagar . pakistan 's army spokesman maj. gen. athar abbas told cnn that pakistan `` made our point clear '' regarding the firefight , which he said began after indian soldiers crossed the line of control that separates kashmir between india and pakistan . but an indian military spokeswoman , capt. neha goyal , told cnn pakistani troops crossed the line of control and `` started firing on our patrol , '' killing an indian soldier . `` our troops also retaliated and the pakistan army troopers ran back , '' she said . abbas said `` further action should be taken '' following tuesday 's `` flag meeting , '' but did not elaborate . the meeting took place along the line of control . reports in india 's media said four pakistani soldiers were killed , but pakistan 's military `` strongly denied the report of any -lrb- casualties -rrb- on the pakistani side . '' pakistan 's military also denied its forces crossed the line of control , saying the skirmish started when indian soldiers tried to establish a forward post on pakistan 's side of the line . `` on pakistan 's ' objection , indian troops opened indiscriminate and unprovoked fire , '' a pakistan military news release , posted on monday , stated . `` the indian fire was immediately responded to . the firing continued -- intermittently during the whole night . '' pakistan said the indian soldiers `` were forced to flee from the area leaving behind their weapons '' after the firefight . indian and pakistani forces have exchanged periodic gunfire since may , but monday 's clashes appear to be a serious setback to the ongoing peace process between the two nations . india and pakistan had announced a bilateral cease-fire all along their borders in november 2003 and the cease-fire had been holding on the borders until recently . kashmir has been at the root of two wars between india and pakistan , both of which tested nuclear weapons in 1998 . an 18-year separatist campaign in the indian-controlled portion of the largely muslim territory has claimed more than 43,000 lives , according to government officials , although human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the toll at twice that number . india has long accused pakistan of supporting the separatists in kashmir , a charge pakistan denies . india blamed militants from pakistan for a suicide car bombing outside its embassy in afghanistan that killed 58 people on july 7 . a december 2001 attack on india 's parliament that india blamed on the militants brought the two nations to the brink of another war , but they have expanded economic and cultural ties since the november 2003 cease-fire agreement . -- cnn 's aliza kassim in atlanta and mukhtar ahmad in srinagar contributed to this report .
820	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. army 's official history of the iraq war shows military chiefs made mistake after mistake in the early months of the conflict . iraqis watch as a statue of saddam hussein is toppled in baghdad in 2003 . failures to recognize the chaos engulfing the country and to send in enough troops to restore order after the 2003 invasion have long been highlighted by critics , but a new report shows the army assessing itself . frank opinions from officers serving in the 18 months from the start of war to iraqi elections in january 2005 reveal there were concerns at the time , not just about assumptions made by planners but at decisions taken once u.s.-led coalition forces had control of iraq . `` i flipped , '' gen. jack keane , then the army 's deputy chief of staff , told the historians of his reaction to a june 2003 decision to transfer control of all coalition troops away from the land forces command that had been preparing for the mission . he recounted a conversation with gen. john abizaid , who succeeded the invasion 's architect , gen. tommy franks . `` i said , ` jesus christ , john , this is a recipe for disaster . we invested in that headquarters . we have the experience and judgment in that headquarters . '' keane said it took the u.s. command between six and eight months to get the new headquarters up and running . during that time , troops in the field saw the mood of ordinary iraqis turn against americans and watched the insurgency take root . `` by the time we got a plan together to resource everything , the insurgents had closed that window of opportunity quickly , '' col. david perkins , a brigade commander in the army 's 3rd infantry division , told the historians . `` what we started doing in september was probably a good idea to have done in april 2003 . '' franks , who would soon retire and be awarded the presidential medal of freedom , said he ordered the transition to force the pentagon to get leaders into the field to work with civilian occupation officials . `` that is a task that john abizaid and i very simply laid on washington and said , ` figure it out . do it fast . get me a joint headquarters in here . we have a lot of work to do and -lsb- civilian administrator of iraq -rsb- jerry bremer has a lot of responsibility and he needs help , ' '' he recalled . the 720-page report compiled by the combat studies institute at fort leavenworth , kansas , details the effects of having too few coalition troops on the ground when the reality after the fall of baghdad was `` severely out of line '' with the anticipated conditions . previous experience `` should have indicated that many more troops would be needed for the post-saddam era in iraq , '' historians wrote in the report , `` on point ii : transition to a new campaign . '' `` the coalition 's inability to prevent looting , to secure iraq 's borders and to guard the vast number of munitions dumps in the early months after saddam 's overthrow are indicative of the shortage , '' the study found . about 150,000 u.s. and allied troops were in iraq after the invasion , at a time when war planners were assuming that iraq 's government would remain functional after hussein 's ouster and that there would be no mass insurgency . `` these factors were in line with prewar planning for a quick turnover of power to iraqis and a quick withdrawal of u.s. forces , leaving iraqis to determine their own political future -- options that proved impossible to execute , '' the historians wrote in the report released over the weekend . `` we had the wrong assumptions , and therefore , we had the wrong plan to put into play , '' gen. william wallace , who commanded the army 's v corps during the invasion , told the authors . but some of the most critical decisions were made between may and august 2003 , which some participants called a `` window of opportunity that could have been exploited to produce the conditions for the quick creation of a new iraq . '' among those decisions were the frequently criticized dissolution of the iraqi army and the order that barred former members of hussein 's baath party from public life as well as the change in plan over the joint headquarters .

822	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the inspector-general of the house of representatives will investigate recent allegations of sexual misconduct among congressional pages , the democratic and republican leaders of the chamber announced . the house page program came under scrutiny after the mark foley scandal last year . two pages -- usually high school juniors who serve congress as messengers -- have been dismissed for allegedly having oral sex in public areas of their capitol hill dormitory . `` it was n't kissing and hugging -- let me put it that way , '' said rep. ginny brown-waite , r-florida , last week . `` it did go beyond that . there were not only a young male and female involved , but there were also observers and other page participants who were , let 's say , enablers .

824	copenhagen , denamrk -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- what makes someone decide to become an actor ? it sometimes seems as if the average hollywood star is motivated mainly by the promise of a fat pay check . connie nielsen shot to fame playing lucilla in `` gladiator . '' or perhaps they 're drawn to the celebrity lifestyle . maybe they crave the love of an adoring public , or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world , to be immortalized on celluloid . for danish actress connie nielsen it was something quite different . for her , being an actor means being an outsider . `` as an artist you actually do have to make a choice to be an outsider . if you 're an outsider you have the freedom to say what people on the inside do n't dare to say , '' she told cnn . so connie nielsen is not your typical movie star . as a 5-foot-10-inch blonde scandinavian beauty she has the looks of a classic silver screen siren , but she has steadfastly resisted a career as hollywood eye candy and rejected the lifestyle that goes with it . `` i absolutely refuse the fame part of my business , '' she says . `` i refuse even the money side of my business . i try to do as good work as i can do , i try to grow in my art and reach for truth , '' she says . raised in elling , a small coastal village in denmark , she is fluent in seven languages and studied acting in france and italy , making her screen debut in french comedy `` par où t'es rentré ? on t ' a pas vu sortir '' -lrb- u.s. title `` how did you get in ? we did n't see you leave '' -rrb- in 1984 . she appeared in more french and italian movies before landing a role opposite al pacino and keanu reeves in `` the devil 's advocate '' in 1997 . but it was n't until 2000 , when she was cast in ridley scott 's oscar-winning `` gladiator '' , that nielsen landed a role that really let her show her acting ability . as lucilla , the sister of the villainous emperor commodus , nielsen brought some much-needed subtlety to the swords-and-sandals epic and held her own sharing the screen with joaquin phoenix and russell crowe . the movie made nielsen an international star and she scored other successes with `` one hour photo '' in 2002 , and `` the hunted '' in 2003 . but while the success of `` gladiator '' opened doors for her , it also meant she had to fight the kind of typecasting that would try to limit her to playing `` the love interest '' to a male lead who got all the good lines . nielsen has in the past been critical of hollywood for its lack of female roles , saying `` you think once you 've shown what you can do , and your movies have been successful , that snap , you work . so to discover the difference between guys ' roles and girls ' roles made me plain mad . it 's unjust . '' but nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed , seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies . she appeared in french movie `` demonlover '' , which dealt with pornography , violence and corporate amorality , while more recent films have taken on the wars in afghanistan and iraq . danish drama `` brødre '' -lrb- u.s. title `` brothers '' -rrb- is about a soldier who returns from afghanistan a broken man , unable to communicate his experiences from the conflict . playing his wife , nielsen put in a powerful performance that won her awards and served to highlight how hollywood had underused her talents . `` the situation '' in 2006 was billed as the first film to be made about the iraq war and told the story of ordinary iraqis caught up in the conflict , while `` battle of seattle '' examined how peaceful protests erupted into riots when the world trade organization met in seattle in 1999 . of her choice of subject matter , nielsen says that rather than making a political point she is trying to show the human aspects of the conflicts . but nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies . she is passionate about literature and art and she is currently dating lars ulrich , drummer of rock group metallica . she had a son with him in 2007 and has another son from a previous relationship . `` i will always find something that i want to try and become better at . i always love to spend more time with my friends , more time with my family , my extended family . i always want to read more books , '' she says . perhaps her commitment to her art , her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her danish upbringing , but there 's no doubt that compared to many other hollywood stars connie nielsen is a breath of fresh air .

'' `` i think one of the things that folks need to understand is that scientific evidence , things that have to go to the lab , they 're going to take time , '' bergamine said . `` this is not the world of television and ` csi .

826	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a magnitude-5 .4 earthquake shook the los angeles metropolitan area tuesday , leaving residents rattled but causing no serious damage or injuries . bricks and other debris clutter an alleyway in pomona , near los angeles tuesday afternoon . however , the temblor served as a warning to southern californians who had not experienced an earthquake in some time : the `` big one '' remains a possibility . `` this is a sample , a small sample , '' said kate hutton , a seismologist at the california institute of technology . `` this is somewhere between small and moderate . '' she said there is a 5 percent chance the quake could be a precursor to a larger earthquake . after 24 hours , she said , that chance will drop to 1 percent . `` every earthquake relieves some stress , '' hutton said . `` it 's usually only a drop in the ocean . in other words , the amount of stress released by this earthquake is minuscule compared to the amount that 's built up and is building up for the big one when it happens some day in the future . '' watch hutton say tuesday 's quake was a sign of bigger ones to come '' and when will that be ? `` from a geologist 's point of view , the answer has to be soon , '' she said . `` but geologists are used to thinking on millions of years and thousands of years time scale , so i do n't think that gives any useful information for people , except be prepared at any time because it could happen at any time . '' a 5.4 magnitude quake is considered by the usgs to be `` moderate , '' which can cause slight damage to buildings and others structures . so far this year , 39 `` moderate '' earthquakes of between magnitude 5.0 and 5.9 have occurred in the united states , and 790 globally . the last moderate quake to strike california was a magnitude 5.4 in april in the northern part of the state . a magnitude 4.4 struck the greater los angeles area in august 2007 . there is a 99 percent chance of california experiencing a quake of magnitude 6.7 or larger within the next 30 years , according to the uniform california earthquake rupture forecast , sponsored by the u.s. geological survey , the california geological survey and the southern california earthquake center and published in science daily in april . `` this earthquake reminds us to be prepared , '' said california gov. arnold schwarzenegger . `` we were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries or property damage . '' he said he believes the state is `` as prepared as anyone can be . we have continuous discussions about that . we are fanatics about emergencies and to be ready . '' the largest earthquake in recent years in california was a magnitude 7.1 in 1999 , hutton said . but it was centered in the desert , near twentynine palms , in a sparsely populated area . tuesday 's quake struck about 11:42 a.m. , according to the usgs . its epicenter was about 2 miles southwest of chino hills and about 5 miles southeast of diamond bar . the epicenter was about 7.6 miles deep , making it a fairly shallow quake , according to cnn meteorologist chad meyers . in general , earthquakes centered closer to the surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground . but most southern california earthquakes tend to be fairly shallow , officials said . more than 30 aftershocks were recorded . hutton said the largest was a magnitude 3.6 . los angeles police said a downtown hotel sustained some structural damage , but no one was injured and the building was not evacuated . there were some unconfirmed reports of minor injuries . the white house was also monitoring the situation , said spokeswoman dana perino . despite the absence of serious damage or injuries , some los angeles-area residents were left rattled . the quake was felt as far south as san diego , california , and the usgs said it received reports of light shaking as far north as rosamond , california , about 55 miles north-northeast of los angeles . reports from those who felt the quake poured into cnn . did you feel the quake ? `` my house was like a fun house . everything was moving , '' said danny casler , 28 , of huntington beach . he said he was sleeping when his house began shaking , and some things fell in the living room . he said he ran out of the house in his boxer shorts . attorney kevin crisp said he was on the phone with his law partner in riverside , 65 miles away , who burst out , `` big quake ! '' crisp said he felt it about five seconds later . `` this was very impressive . long and very uniform . really had the building going . '' he said doors were swinging on the hinges and bottles of wine were rolling back and forth on his shelf . `` it just started with a really strong jolt , '' said wendy criner . `` i ran and got my daughters from different rooms , and we squatted in the living room . i did have stuff fall off the shelf , some books in my daughters ' room and some things in the kitchen . '' the quake knocked out a ground radar system at los angeles international airport , but that has not interfered with operations , according to the federal aviation administration . technicians were working to restore the system , which helps controllers monitor traffic on the ground . also , tiles fell from the ceiling in one terminal as water flowed from a burst pipe . the calculation of the quake 's magnitude fluctuated as seismologists reviewed the data . initially classified as a magnitude 5.8 , the quake 's intensity was reduced to a 5.6 and then to a 5.4 . because the earthquake magnitude scale is exponential , a 5.8 magnitude quake is four to five times more intense than a 5.4 . two nuclear plants are in the vicinity of the quake 's epicenter near chino hills , according to the nuclear regulatory commission . the closest to the epicenter is in san onofre , 50 miles south , but an nrc spokesman said , `` this is well below the threshold for any conceivable damage to the plants . '' `` in the u.s. particularly in california , buildings are generally built well enough that it takes about a 5.5 for there to be some damage , so we do have the potential for damage , '' said don blakeman , an analyst for the usgs . `` it depends on the structures -lsb- and -rsb- the ground the building is built on . '' he said he would expect objects to be knocked from shelves and some windows broken . `` it 's kind of on the margin where you 'll get some structural damage from these . we may find that some of the older homes and buildings that were n't retrofitted suffer more damage than the newer structures . `` i would expect some cracked buildings , '' he said . `` there is the potential for injuries , but hopefully we wo n't have too much of that . '' blakeman 's comments came before the quake 's magnitude was dropped to a 5.4 . however , he said afterward that the change does not affect his expectations , although obviously there is less potential for damage . still , the quake jolted the nerves of many californians . `` i 've lived in california , i 've lived through several of them , '' margot wagner of santa barbara told cnn . `` it 's always a little unnerving .

'' `` this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours ' operations out of service , '' hill said . `` to date , angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service . '' in addition , `` fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements . '' he said police have been asked to stop any of the companies ' buses . both companies are owned by angel de la torre . a man who answered the phone at angel tours office said the owner was meeting with his lawyers and was unavailable . massage therapist leha nguyen , 45 , was a passenger . she was traveling by herself on the bus when she departed houston at 8:30 p.m. thursday for what was to have been her fourth trip to carthage , missouri . after sandwiches were passed around , the group said prayers , and nguyen began to drift off to sleep in her window seat next to an older woman , four rows behind the driver , she said . ireport.com : were you there ? send photos , video . about 11:45 p.m. , the bus passed dallas , `` and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two-way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling , not a safe feeling , '' she said . she added , `` i feel a little bit shaky , but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep . '' her sleep did n't last long . `` as i opened my eyes , i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady , she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady , she can not move .

832	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- radovan karadzic , whose interpol charges listed `` flamboyant behavior '' as a distinguishing characteristic , was a practicing psychiatrist who came to be nicknamed the `` butcher of bosnia . '' twice indicted in 1995 by the u.n. international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , karadzic faces charges of genocide , complicity in genocide , extermination , murder , willful killing , persecutions , deportation , inhumane acts , terror against civilians and hostage-taking . while president of the so-called serbian republic of bosnia-herzegovina , karadzic 's troops were reported to have massacred over hundreds of thousands of muslims and croats during a campaign of `` ethnic cleansing . '' early estimates of the death toll from the 3-year war ranged up to 300,000 , but recent research reduced that to about 100,000 . the u.s. state department had a $ 5 million reward for information leading to his capture . his arrest brings an end to more than 10 years as a fugitive . watch cnn 's chief international correspondent christiane amanpour report on karadzic 's rise and fall '' karadzic was born on june 19 , 1945 , in petnjica , montenegro . he studied psychiatry and medicine at the university of sarajevo during the 1960s and took courses in psychiatry and poetry at columbia university from 1974 to 1975 . karadzic , a serb-croat , in 1990 helped found the serbian democratic party -lrb- sds -rrb- , a party aimed at unifying serbs into a common state , and became its president . two years later , he became president of the newly declared serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina , later called `` republika srpska . '' during the next three years , he ordered bosnian serb forces to seize the majority of bosnia and herzegovina . he also announced , according to his u.n. indictment , six `` strategic objectives '' for the serbian people . they included the establishment of state borders between the serbs and the other two ethnic communities , bosnian muslims and bosnian croats . answering to him , according to the indictment , was bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic . from may 1992 , the indictment alleged , bosnian serb forces under mladic 's command targeted civilian areas of sarajevo with shelling and sniping during a three-year conflict within the city . in july 1995 , according to the u.n. indictment , troops under mladic 's command executed an estimated 7,000 bosnian muslim male prisoners in srebrenica , a u.n. safe area , and then participated in a comprehensive effort to conceal the killings . the massacre is considered the worst in europe since world war ii . the indictment states that bosnian serb forces acted under karadzic 's direction and worked to `` significantly reduce the bosnian muslim , bosnian croat and other non-serb populations '' in municipalities that were seized . karadzic was last seen in public in september 1996 , a year after the dayton peace accords brought a formal end to the conflict and banned anyone accused of war crimes , including him , from office . he reportedly shaved his trademark bushy hair , grew a beard and donned priest 's robes , moving from monastery to monastery in the mountains to avoid capture . cnn correspondent alessio vinci said : `` he enjoyed protection from the local population , wherever he was hiding . legend has it he disguised himself as a priest to take part in his mother 's funeral . `` in 2002 , after nato launched one of its many failed raids to try to arrest karadzic in bosnia , i interviewed his mother . at that time she said : ` serbs are righteous people and i can see that they support him , and that they adore him the way he is . they would lose their lives to protect him .

'' aol autos : consumer reports on best fuel-efficient used cars . why so expensive in california ? marie montgomery , spokeswoman for the automobile club of southern california , says the primary reason behind the high price of gas in california is `` market segmentation , '' a marketing term that basically means california -lrb- along with many other states -rrb- has developed a `` boutique blend '' of fuel in a bid to uphold environmental or ecological standards . in california 's case , this blend helps clear the state 's notorious smog . `` we ca n't use gas they made for iowa . we use a special blend with additives in it , an ethanol mix , '' montgomery said . `` when you do that , you can only use refineries that make that gas -lsb- mix -rsb- . the refineries in california are a major supplier , but , when prices are high and there 's not another supplier , we have to go where they make that mix . '' she pointed out that refineries in oregon and washington produce the gas product , and there is a pipeline to alaska , but that the only other options are shipping in the blend from elsewhere in the nation or asia , which is not cost-efficient . `` people have to figure out how to deal with this on a long-term basis . we 've been telling motorists to carpool and here we are in summer , and prices have barely come down , '' she said . `` usually we 're about a month into a downturn , it 's cyclical : prices go up in spring and spike in may , which is n't happening this year . prices may not come down a lot . '' less misery in missouri . michael right , vice president of public affairs for aaa missouri , said his state is usually among the top three in terms of low gas prices . a contributing factor , he said , is that the state 's per-gallon tax rate is the lowest in the nation . he said that most , if not all , states impose a tax on gasoline but few are as low as the 17 cents a gallon missouri levies . and missouri , unlike most other states , does n't impose a sales tax on top of that . the state also benefits from good distribution via a crisscrossing network of pipelines which can , unusually , result in cheaper gas in rural areas than in major cities . the reason for this is the three types of gas used in the state . st louis primarily uses reformulated gasoline . conventional gas is sold in rural areas , and kansas city uses low rvp -lrb- or low-emission -rrb- gasoline . reformulated costs more than conventional gas , hence the higher cost in cities . `` in illinois , it 's not unusual to save 15 cents a gallon by crossing the river , '' right said . aol autos : best hybrid suvs . effects on station owners and operators . while the effects of soaring pump prices on consumers are well documented , owners and operators of service stations nationwide are also feeling the pain acutely . dennis decota , the executive director of the 135-year-old california service station and automotive repair association and owner of a service station in marin county , california , said high prices are `` extremely detrimental to business people . what it does is creates a financial hardship on customers , -lsb- leading to -rsb- less foot traffic to stores or repair facilities . it puts a strain on entire businesses ; unbranded service stations are really at the end of their rope . '' independent , unbranded stations have one retail philosophy : offer the best price . they rely on oversupply by refineries which they buy at wholesale prices and sell cheaper than the branded competition , like shell or exxon -lrb- which have both announced they are quitting the service-station industry -rrb- . but in the past six months , that supply curve has become inverted , which means owner-operators are paying more -- $ 37,000 a truckload -- for their gas than branded outlets . decota noted some are losing as much as 15 cents a gallon on every sale . it 's a hard time for the industry , he said . the blame for high oil prices is pretty evenly spread , decota said . he did , however , point out that as a result of higher gas prices , california brought in $ 4.4 billion last year in sales taxes from its monthly sales of 1,300,000,000 gallons . in 2002 , when gas prices averaged about $ 1.71 a gallon , it brought in $ 1.7 billion . decota advocates boosting refinery capacity from its current level of 88 percent to about 92 percent . he said refineries `` have their hands on the spigot . there is no shortage of crude . but if the government stepped up refinery capacity , that would put enough downward pressure to create competition among refineries . and my guys are going under .

'' the crisis in georgia started friday , when russia moved troops in into south ossetia after the georgian government moved troops into breakaway territory . south ossetia has been largely autonomous since 1991 , but separatists would like to break with georgia and either declare independence or join north ossetia , which is part of russia . secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is heading to france and the georgian capitol of tbilisi , said wednesday that she has been briefing both candidates on the conflict . watch president bush declare ` america 's unwavering support ' for georgia '' when the crisis began last week , mccain , the presumptive republican presidential nominee , was out front in condemning the russia actions and calling for a cease-fire . `` today , we are all georgians , '' mccain said tuesday . watch mccain declare ` we are all georgians ' '' when the crisis broke out last week , the obama camp called `` for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict , '' echoing the statements from the white house and the european union . as russia planes bombed georgian cities and russian troops advanced into georgia , obama , who is on vacation in hawaii , condemned russia 's actions and called for a cease-fire . watch obama condemn russia 's actions '' mccain said wednesday that the crisis was not the time for partisan attacks . `` i know the people of georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom . and i know that at this time they 're suffering mightily , '' the arizona republican said . `` so maybe later on in the campaign , let 's have a back-and-forth about who has comments or statements . now , let 's devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy . '' but , despite mccain comments , the crisis in georgia has dominated the political debate between the two candidates ' campaigns in recent days . on tuesday , randy scheunemann , mccain 's top foreign policy adviser , attacked the presumptive democratic presidential nominee 's response to the situation in georgia , saying his experience with the region amounted to a handful of paper statements . on the other hand , mccain 's experience with georgia runs deep , scheunemann said , noting that mccain and the georgian president were friends . `` there 's a depth of knowledge , a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that does n't compare between the two on russia policy , '' scheunemann said . `` you ca n't compare a 15-year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months . '' but susan rice , obama 's senior foreign policy adviser , said tuesday that mccain 's comments condemning russia `` may or may not have complicated the situation . '' `` we can not shoot from the hip , '' rice told msnbc on tuesday . `` we can not act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions . when this crisis began , barack obama , the administration ... and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them . '' mccain spokesman tucker bounds said wednesday that his campaign was disappointed that rice had launched `` inflammatory and baseless '' political attacks `` during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most . '' in response , hari sevugan , a spokesman for the obama , said it was `` the absolute height of hypocrisy '' for the mccain campaign to `` play the victim '' after attacking obama 's `` strong and appropriate '' position on georgia . bill schneider , a cnn senior political analyst , said mccain could use the situation in georgia to highlight one his inherent advantages over obama : his experience . but mccain 's strong position in defiance of russia also has risks , schneider said . `` some voters may worry : does he want to start a new cold war ? the risk for mccain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten war-weary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home , '' schneider said . cnn 's peter hamby contributed to this report .

841	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a slim majority of americans think churches should stay out of politics , according to a new survey . john mccain , the rev. rick warren and barack obama together for a cnn broadcast forum on faith . the survey suggests that for the first time in more than a decade , there has been a shift away from the view that religious groups should influence social and political issues . fifty-two percent of poll respondents said churches should stay quiet , while 46 percent said churches should express political views . the biggest shift has come among republicans , one of the authors of the poll said . `` overall , the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly , but among republicans it is up 11 points , and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points , '' said greg smith , a research fellow at the pew forum on religion & public life . `` there is a slight uptick , from 40 percent to 46 percent , among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion , but it is up 10 points among republicans , '' he added . four years ago , seven out of 10 conservatives approved of religious institutions expressing political views . but five out of 10 conservatives in thursday 's poll said it was appropriate . it seems that the more important social issues are to conservatives , the more likely they were to say that religion and politics should not mix . among people who said gay marriage was a very important issue , the number saying houses of worship should keep out of politics doubled , from 25 percent to 50 percent . among those who said it was not important , the number was essentially unchanged . respondents were also more likely to say houses of worship should not meddle in politics if they considered the major political parties to be hostile to religion . the new figures bring republican views into line with those of democrats and independents . a 14-point gap between republican and democratic views on the subject in august 2004 fell to one point in the new survey . but smith cautioned against reading the survey to mean basic conservative philosophy was changing . `` it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift , '' he said . `` it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion , but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics . '' `` voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all , '' smith added . republican candidate sen. john mccain `` has a huge lead even among younger evangelicals . '' but social conservatives are lukewarm about mccain as compared to president bush . nearly seven out of 10 white evangelical protestants and conservatives said they supported mccain ; the number was slightly higher for bush in august 2004 . but four years ago , 57 percent of them said they backed bush strongly . the number is 28 percent for mccain this year , with 40 percent saying they backed him , but not strongly . the number of people who think religious groups have too much influence over political parties grew -- for both republicans and democrats -- as did the percentage of people who are uncomfortable hearing politicians talk about how religious they are . americans continue to see the republican party as more friendly to religion than the democrats , although the democrats closed the gap somewhat since reaching a low point in 2006 . other survey results showed little change from the past . two out of three americans continue to say churches should not endorse candidates for president , and most still feel a president should have strong religious beliefs . the survey was conducted by the pew research center for people & the press and the pew forum on religion & public life by interviewing 2,905 adults nationwide by phone between july 31 and august 10 . on saturday , obama and mccain answered questions that had religious overtones at a forum hosted by the rev. rick warren . the pastor of southern california 's saddleback church is author of the best-selling book `` the purpose-driven life . '' asked when life begins , mccain was quick to say `` at the moment of conception . '' mccain 's response was met with huge applause from the audience . `` i have a 25-year pro-life record in the congress , in the senate , and as president of the united states , i will be a pro-life president , and this presidency will have pro-life policies , '' he said . when obama was asked about when life begins , the pro-choice candidate said that decision is `` above my pay grade . '' the response garnered criticism from liberal and conservative thinkers who said obama tried to dodge the issue . obama said although he 's pro-choice and supports a woman 's right to abortion , his goal is to reduce the number of abortions in america . `` on this particular issue , if you believe that life begins at conception ... and you are consistent , then i ca n't argue with you on that , '' he said . `` what i can do is say , ` are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies ? ' ''

844	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states and britain praised pakistani president pervez musharraf 's contribution to the war on terror while the bush administration claimed no role in the leader 's resignation monday . pakistan 's pervez musharraf has until now stubbornly resisted pressure to quit . a senior state department official familiar with the situation told cnn u.s. officials were in touch with musharraf in the week leading up to the resignation . however , the official said , the united states made it clear that it would not get involved in the struggle between musharraf and the newly elected pakistani parliament . `` if he made a decision to go , or fight against it -- we did n't advise him either way , '' the official said . `` we really did keep our fingers out of this one . '' musharraf is viewed as a keen ally of the west in the fight on terror , receiving billions in military aid from both and launching attacks on militant groups near the country 's border with afghanistan . watch musharraf resign '' `` president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the world 's most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism , '' said secretary of state condoleezza rice after musharraf 's announcement . `` we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistan 's future and its most urgent needs , including stemming the growth of extremism , addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability , '' she added . `` the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable , prosperous , democratic , modern , muslim nation . '' the bush administration 's main priority is a crackdown on taliban and al qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions . the administration believes pakistan 's intelligence service is full of al qaeda and taliban loyalists , an accusation pakistan denies . view a timeline of musharraf 's time in power '' `` there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u.s. government with pakistan 's inability to follow through on what the u.s. sees as its clear commitments , '' said robert grenier , a former cia counterterrorism official , now a managing director at risk consultation firm kroll . `` it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically-elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way , '' he said . `` they have n't demonstrated an ability to do that . '' the united states has stepped up missile strikes inside pakistan , killing dozens of militants , and head of the army , gen. ashfaq kiyani , is now the united states ' closest ally in power . but some experts warn that u.s. pressure could go too far . `` the u.s. military has to be extremely cautious , '' said rick barton , a director and adviser with the non-profit center for strategic and international studies who is a former u.n. and u.s. official . `` it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country . '' musharraf told the nation in a televised address monday that he would step down -- nearly nine years after he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 . `` i do n't want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty , '' he said . until now , musharraf , 65 , had stubbornly resisted pressure to resign . but his once-considerable power eroded significantly since february 's election that pushed his party out of power . that pressure increased in the past few weeks as the new ruling party began making plans to impeach him . only time will tell whether the power shift will benefit pakistan , but `` it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government . there is no more excuse any more . they have to stand up and do things . they ca n't blame musharraf , '' the state department official said . the official said musharraf is n't expected to try to undermine the government . `` i really do n't think he has been a factor for six months , '' the official said . `` he has n't been able to do that while he was in the presidency , and he wo n't be as well-positioned -lsb- out of the presidency -rsb- to interfere .

'' `` president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic , political and security challenges they face . '' british foreign secretary david miliband said it was strongly committed to its alliance with pakistan following musharraf 's resignation . he praised musharraf 's economic and security achievements , described pakistan as a `` vital friend '' and said britain 's aid program for the country would continue . meanwhile , an afghanistan government spokesman said musharraf 's resignation would be good for afghanistan . the indian government said in a statement that it had no comment to make . `` this is an internal matter of pakistan .

'' military officials said both marines were stationed at camp lejeune , which is about two hours away from wimunc 's fayetteville home . joe lenczyk -- resident agent-in-charge for the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives -- said wimunc and her husband were estranged and lived apart . wimunc is the second female soldier from fort bragg to die under suspicious circumstances in recent weeks . spc. megan lynn touma , 23 , was seven months pregnant at the time of her death in june , authorities said . investigators say they are treating that death as a homicide . camp lejeune also has had a suspicious death of a female soldier this year . twenty-year-old pregnant marine lance cpl. maria lauterbach 's charred body was found january in the back yard of another marine stationed at the base . that suspect , u.s. marine cpl. cesar laurean , was captured in april in mexico .

'' moyo -- the national chairman of the main movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- party -- received 110 votes while his only opponent , paul themba-nyathi , received 98 votes . the speaker of the parliament is the fourth most powerful post in zimbabwe . themba-nyathi represented the splinter mdc faction led by arthur mutambara , but he had support of president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party . the vote took place hours after mugabe swore in lawmakers , five months after they were elected . two members of the main mdc -- led by presidential candidate morgan tsvangirai -- were arrested as they arrived at the opening session , but they were released after a short time , according to a government spokesman . an mdc official said the arrests were part of the `` sinister agenda of this regime '' to `` tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament . '' one of those detained -- shuwa mudiwa -- appeared back in parliament , but the other member -- elia jembere -- was not seen , according to sources . government spokesman bright matonga said jembere had been accused of rape , but that he has been released from custody . a third member -- elton mangoma -- escaped an arrest attempt when other party members came to his rescue , mdc officials said . attendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the mdc and the mugabe 's zanu-pf . the ruling zanu-pf party lost its majority in the 210-seat parliament in elections in march , but vote recounts and political violence have delayed the body from convening until now . final results gave 100 seats to an mdc faction led by morgan tsvangirai , the party 's presidential candidate . president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf got 99 seats . an offshoot of the main mdc party , led by arthur mutambara , won 10 seats . an independent candidate won one seat . tsvangirai , who was locked in a bitter presidential contest with mugabe , had objected to mugabe 's decision to convene parliament , saying it could `` decapitate '' power-sharing talks that have been on hold for the past two weeks . still , tsvangirai said he would attend the swearing-in ceremony . mdc party spokesman nelson chamisa said all mdc members elected to parliament were expected to attend `` except those few mps who are still in hiding .

853	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi reversed her opposition to a vote on offshore drilling on `` larry king live '' on monday night , saying she would consider a vote if it were part of a larger energy package . u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi urges the release of oil from strategic reserves as a way to bring down gas prices . pelosi and fellow house democrats have staunchly opposed republicans ' request for a vote on the drilling . some republicans stayed in chambers after congress adjourned for the session , making speeches on energy policies , in an attempt to get democrats to come back for a vote . reacting to pelosi 's remarks , house minority leader john boehner , r-ohio , said the speaker should call the house of representatives back from its summer recess immediately if she is sincere about a vote on off-shore drilling . `` our message to speaker pelosi is very simple : we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now , and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the american people the relief they expect and deserve , '' boehner said . `` if you meant what you said last night , we welcome you and your democratic colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on american energy . '' on monday night , pelosi said the vote would need to be part of a larger discussion that would include investing in renewable energy resources and releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve . those options would help bring both immediate and long-lasting solutions to the energy crisis , she said . in her interview with king , pelosi talked about what the government and country needs to do to avert the energy crisis and quickly bring down gas prices . the following is an edited version of the interview : . larry king : ok , madam speaker , author of `` know your power , '' why do n't you bring -lsb- congress -rsb- back ? speaker nancy pelosi : well , it 's interesting to hear sen. -lsb- john -rsb- mccain talk about bringing congress back . he was n't even in congress this last session when we really had two very important bills on energy -- one to give tax credit for wind , solar and other renewable resources , and another about hybrid cars and the rest . so he was n't in to vote when were in session and now he 's saying call it back in . and then one of the others said to the president , call congress back in . and the president said no . the president said no . but the point is this : the american people are suffering . we have to do what is best for them . how do we bring down the prices at the pump ? we have said to the president , the fastest way to do this if in 10 days the price can come down if you will free our oil . over 700 million barrels of oil the president is sitting on of the strategic petroleum reserve . no. 1 , free our oil . no. 2 , they want to drill . if they want to drill , we have 68 million acres in the lower 48 that they can drill in that are permitted and all the rest . three , stop the speculation . four , renew -- invest in renewable energy resources , which will bring a faster return than drilling offshore , which will take 10 years and produce 2 cents ' reduction in 10 years off the price at the pump . and then use natural gas . natural gas is so plentiful . it 's better for the environment , and it is cheaper . so there are things that congress can do , and we have voted on this over and over again . but the republicans and the president have resisted . instead , they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas . well , we can do that . we can have a vote on that . but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them . king : would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling ? pelosi : i would not . it depends how the drilling is put forth . but i do n't -- that is not excluded , let me say it that way . it depends how that is proposed , if the safeguards are there . now , mind you , 68 million acres -- 10 million more acres in alaska where they can drill . but if there 's -- if we can get some great things , in terms of renewable energy resources : a renewable electricity standard , wind , solar , biofuels and the rest in that context , because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling , you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels , and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment , cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming . and the consumer is our first responsibility . the american taxpayer owns this oil offshore , by the way . let me make this one final point . this oil is owned by the american taxpayers . the oil companies drill . we give them money to drill there . but we get very little in return . so i think as we have this debate , which is a very healthy one to have and i welcome it ; we have to review and realign the relationship between our oil , big oil 's profits and what it means to the consumer and the taxpayer . king : do you expect -- do you suspect the oil companies of having a lot of clout here , influence over the republicans ? pelosi : of course . yes , they rule . and that 's what we 'll find out . king : they rule ? pelosi : when we have this vote , when we really define it and where the choice is clear to the american people -- i mean , do you know what -- exxon mobil , their last quarter , their profits were historic . last year , they were historic . they outdid themselves this year already in this second quarter . and they insist that we pay them to drill . they need an incentive to drill in order to make over $ 11 billion in one quarter . and it just does n't make sense . we should be using that money to invest in renewable resources , tax credit for wind and solar , etc. and invest in the technologies that will develop the battery and the rest , instead of giving big oil more profits . king : do you expect to get a big enough majority in the senate and house for the democrats to overcome anything and get through your proposals ? pelosi : well , i hope we can do some of it before we even leave this session . i think we can -- hopefully , we can do something before december . i will not subscribe to a hoax on the american people that if you drill offshore , you 're going to bring down the price at the pump . even the president says that 's not true . ten years , two cents -- we 're saying 10 days , bring down the price , if the president would free our oil from the strategic petroleum -lsb- reserve -rsb- -- from our stockpile -- owned by the taxpayers , purchased by the taxpayers . in the next election , i know that we will strengthen our majorities , increase their numbers , and we will have a democratic president in the white house , and we will be able to address more fully really what i think is the challenge to our generation -- energy security and global warming .
854	mogadishu , somalia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a roadside bombing in somalia 's capital killed 21 women who were cleaning rubbish from a southern mogadishu street on sunday morning , a hospital official said . mogadishu residents gather around victims of the bomb attack along the city 's maka al mukarama road . the bomb blast wounded another 46 people , most of them somali women who had gathered to clean maka al mukarama road in southern mogadishu 's kilometer 4 district , according to medina hospital director dr. dahir dhere . `` it suddenly turned the area into a carnage , scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area , '' said witness asha ise gedi . `` there were pools of blood everywhere . i have never seen such mass killing . '' `` they were innocent poor mothers or sisters , '' gedi said . `` why did they deserve this ? '' it is unclear who is behind the attack . mogadishu mayor mohamed omar habeb mohamed dhere , who was recently fired by the country 's prime minister , blamed the islamic courts union for waging the attack . but the head of the islamist insurgent group , abid rahim ise adow , denied any involvement and blamed somalia 's government for orchestrating the attack . the victims were participating in a program that allows somali women to work as street cleaners in exchange for food . the united nations ' world food program organized the program , which began last year and is administered by mogadishu 's regional authority . mogadishu has been the site of violence in recent months between ethiopian troops and islamist fighters . somalia 's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital , with the help of the better-equipped ethiopian forces . on saturday , two-thirds of the somali government ministers announced their resignations , blaming prime minister nur hassan nur ade 's `` dictatorship , '' which they said included his firing of mogadishu 's mayor . nur ade said he suspects the mass resignations were aimed at weakening implementation of the peace agreement between somalia 's transitional government and the opposition alliance for the re-liberation of somalia . he said he had no plans to resign . the peace agreement , signed june 9 in djibouti , calls for a cease-fire between somalia 's u.n.-backed transitional government and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia , an opposition group that includes members of the islamist court union which overthrew the government in 2006 . the icu was ousted from power later that year by ethiopian forces , with the support of somalia 's transitional government . if followed , the peace deal would pave the way for a withdrawal of ethiopian troops -- a major sticking point for islamist fighters who oppose their presence . the agreement calls on the alliance to dissociate itself from armed groups still fighting the government and for all sides to allow `` unhindered humanitarian access and assistance '' to all somalis . a joint committee led by u.n. officials will monitor the agreement 's implementation . ethiopian forces became embroiled in an islamist insurgency after the ethiopian forces invaded somalia in december 2006 to overthrow the icu leaders and reinstall the transitional government . as guerrilla attacks mounted , efforts to replace the ethiopians with an african union-led peacekeeping mission faltered . ethiopia 's invasion had the blessing of somalia 's government and the united states , which accused the icu of harboring fugitives from the al qaeda terrorist movement . the conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of somalis , further worsening a humanitarian crisis that dates back to the collapse of the country 's last government in 1991 . the situation has been exacerbated by drought , continual armed conflicts in central and southern somalia , and high inflation on food and fuel prices . cnn 's alan duke and journalists mohamed amin adow and abdi nasir mohamed contributed to this report .

858	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. charles schumer said sunday the bush administration is trying to `` blame the fire on the person who calls 911 '' by suggesting he had a role in one of the costliest u.s. bank failures . sen. charles schumer said the ots `` ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame . '' federal regulators with the office of thrift supervision were `` asleep at the switch '' when it came to indymac 's `` reckless '' behavior , the new york democrat complained . the ots announced friday that it was taking over the $ 32 billion indymac and transferring control to the federal deposit insurance corporation . the ots pointed the finger directly at schumer for the failure , accusing him of sparking a bank run by releasing a letter that `` expressed concerns about indymac 's viability . '' watch what 's next for indymac '' `` in the following 11 business days , depositors withdrew more than $ 1.3 billion from their accounts , '' the ots said in a statement announcing the california-based lender 's takeover on friday . the statement included a quote from ots director john reich saying , `` although this institution was already in distress , i am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process . '' schumer , a member of the senate banking committee , chairman of congress ' joint economic committee and the third-ranking democrat in the senate , rejected any suggestions of responsibility for indymac 's collapse . `` ots ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame and start doing its job to protect the future of the banking system , so that there wo n't be other indymacs , '' he said . schumer 's june 26 letter said he was `` concerned that indymac 's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers . '' in a sunday news conference , he said everything in his letter was already known to the public . `` indymac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks , '' he said . `` it was a spinoff from the old countrywide , and like countrywide , it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have . both indymac and countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we 're now in . '' the embattled countrywide financial corp. was recently purchased by bank of america . schumer argued that the `` breadth and depth '' of the problems at indymac were `` apparent for years , and they accelerated in the last six months . '' but ots , he said , `` was asleep at the switch and allowed things to happen without restraint . `` and now they are doing what the bush administration always does : blame the fire on the person who calls 911 . '' the white house had no immediate response . schumer said ots is `` known as a weak regulator , '' and added , `` my job was to try and toughen them up and that 's what i tried to do .

861	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal investigators will declare the 2001 anthrax case solved on wednesday , when they make public their case against government researcher bruce ivins , a government source familiar with the case told cnn on tuesday . ex-army scientist bruce ivins , seen here in 2003 , died from an apparent suicide last week . but the case will not be considered closed , because administrative details remain incomplete , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing . before making the information public , the fbi is expected to share the evidence of ivins ' involvement with survivors and relatives of victims in the anthrax attacks , the source said . a lawyer for maureen stevens , the widow of bob stevens , the first victim of the 2001 attacks , said she was invited to the session and will attend . the tabloid photo editor died after inhaling anthrax that investigators believe was in a letter sent to american media inc. , the publisher of the sun and national enquirer tabloids , at its offices in boca raton , florida . another source familiar with the investigation said tuesday that in the fall of 2001 , ivins borrowed a machine that can convert wet anthrax , the kind used at fort detrick , into dry powder , which was found in the anthrax letters . such machines , called lyophilizers , are not usually used at fort detrick , where ivins worked , though they are easy to obtain . experts said the report may have no significance . `` i would n't necessarily make the conclusion that , just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer , that that provides a smoking gun , that he must be using this for sinister purposes , '' said peter hotez , chairman of microbiology at george washington university in washington . richard spertzel , a former biodefense scientist who worked with ivins at the lab at fort detrick , said there was `` no way '' a lyophilizer could have created the fine anthrax spores used in the 2001 letters . spertzel said a more advanced machine would have been needed , and that no one working at a u.s. government lab could have produced such high quality anthrax in secret . ivins , who is expected to be blamed for the mailings of the toxin , which killed five people and sickened more than a dozen others -- died july 27 at a hospital in frederick , maryland , from an apparent suicide attempt two days earlier . no charges have been made public . he became a suspect after investigators found dna evidence from the 2001 anthrax mailings on a flask used in his laboratory at the u.s. army medical institute of infectious diseases , said a source who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly about the case . ivins had worked for decades in the biodefense lab at fort detrick , where he was trying to develop a better vaccine against the toxin . the fbi had traced the anthrax used in the attacks to the lab by using a new technology , a u.s. official familiar with the investigation said . authorities were looking at whether ivins may have released anthrax to test a vaccine he was working on , another official said . some of the anthrax-laced letters , written in crude block letters , included the words , `` take penacilin -lrb- sic -rrb- now , '' according to photographs released by the fbi . since ivins ' death , suspicions about his involvement in the anthrax attacks have surfaced alongside questions about his sanity . at the time of his death , the 62-year-old scientist was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions . she accused him of having harassed , stalked and threatened her with violence . the woman told the court in her complaint that ivins had been treated at a mental health facility . steven hatfill , another government scientist who was named by the justice department as a `` person of interest '' in the attacks , was never charged . he sued the department , which settled the case in june . the skepticism in scientific circles about the strength of the case against ivins heightens the importance of the government 's unveiling of its evidence against the scientist , a former prosecutor said . `` i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury , '' said andrew mcbride . `` and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr. ivins , they ought to see that as well .

'' klein 's group has reunited 1,500 families since it began work in 1990 . she said the former soviet union released records in 1989 of concentration camps it liberated , greatly helping organizers find information on holocaust victims . the organization has 100 volunteers -- a third of them holocaust survivors , klein said . the group also helps families find information about their loved ones who died during the holocaust . they have brought together more than 50 families this year . all of their work is free . she says it 's often like `` looking for a needle in a haystack . '' `` we 're playing beat the clock right now , '' she said , adding , `` it 's about families that one day they were together and then they were apart . '' `` when a connection is made , there are just smiles all around . '' that was the case for this family in ukraine . years of trauma , of separation , of not knowing what happened to loved ones , have been replaced by celebration . in a picturesque orchard overlooking rolling fields , galezkij , his wife and their neighbors laid out a feast for his american sister . as the vodka flowed , he told her how he had survived for a lifetime without her . `` he says he always thought he 'd see me someday . he dreamt lots about me , '' famulak said , as she sat next to her brother . `` and he wrote a song for me . when he went to sleep , he sang every night and cried . '' with that , galezkij , weakened by illness and age , burst into song . but this time , he sang the words with pure joy . cnn 's michael sefanov and wayne drash contributed to this report .

'' smith is one of the people to whom recipients of the memo were told to direct journalists ' questions . in a written statement , the epa 's office of inspector general said it did not approve the language of robbi 's warning and advised , `` all epa officials and employees are required to cooperate '' with the office . `` this cooperation includes providing the oig full and unrestricted access to epa documents , records , and personnel , '' the statement read . `` we are currently engaged in discussions with oeca -lsb- office of enforcement and compliance assurance -rsb- to assure that oig and oeca interpretations are consistent in this matter . '' and sen. barbara boxer , a california democrat who has long battled with the agency 's administrator , stephen johnson , said the instructions showed that johnson is `` turning the epa into a secretive , dangerous ally of polluters , instead of a leader in the effort to protect the health and safety of the american people . '' last week , johnson denied a request to appear before two senate committees to talk about whether the epa 's decisions comply with its staff 's legal and technical recommendations . the committee 's chairman , sen. patrick leahy , d-vermont , has asked the inspector general 's office to assess the administration 's claims of executive privilege as it tries to keep documents related to epa decisions from congress . boxer chairs the senate committee on the environment and public works . she is expected to hold a news conference tuesday to talk about what she calls `` political interference in recent epa decisions '' and discuss `` apparent contradictions between the sworn testimony '' of johnson and accounts given by other sworn witnesses .

872	buenos aires , argentina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president cristina fernandez de kirchner repeated her call this week to decriminalize personal drug use and crack down on traffickers and dealers . president cristina fernandez de kirchner says she does n't like to `` condemn someone who has an addiction . '' `` i do n't like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal , as if he were a person who should be persecuted , '' she told a meeting of the national investigation into the consumption of alcohol , tobacco , psychopharmaceuticals and illegal drugs . `` those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances , those who give it away , those who traffic in it . '' a poll shows 2 percent of argentines have tried cocaine , but some people believe decriminalization of drugs could result in wider drug use . regardless , the argentine government is pushing congress to pass the decriminalization legislation by the end of the year . `` decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second-generation human rights , but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention , so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance , '' said anibal fernandez , the minister of security and justice . ethan nadelmann , founder and executive director of the new york-based drug policy alliance , said such policies have been adopted throughout europe and other parts of latin america . `` the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use , '' he said . a few years ago , then-mexican president vicente fox proposed decriminalizing possession of drugs combined with a crackdown on traffickers , but a harsh reaction from the bush administration caused him to retreat , nadelmann said . brazil and colombia have passed laws decriminalizing drug use in an effort to combat the spread of hiv among injecting drug users , he said . politicians recognize that `` you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems , '' nadelmann said . `` this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is , either for political or judicial reasons , a push toward decriminalization of personal possession , sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers , '' he said . `` it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses . '' the concept has gained followers in the united states , too , he said , citing statistics that show two-thirds of americans support drug treatment instead of jail time for first-time drug offenders . on wednesday , rep. barney frank announced a proposal to end federal penalties for americans carrying fewer than 100 grams , or almost a quarter-pound , of marijuana . `` the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the government 's business , '' frank said on capitol hill . `` i do n't think it is the government 's business to tell you how to spend your leisure time .

888	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the dramatic drop in violence in iraq is due in large part to a secret program the u.s. military has used to kill terrorists , according to a new book by pulitzer prize-winning journalist bob woodward . bob woodward 's book , `` the war within : secret white house history 2006-2008 , '' came out monday . the program -- which woodward compares to the world war ii era manhattan project that developed the atomic bomb -- must remain secret for now or it would `` get people killed , '' woodward said monday on cnn 's larry king live . `` it is a wonderful example of american ingenuity solving a problem in war , as we often have , '' woodward said . in `` the war within : secret white house history 2006-2008 , '' woodward disclosed the existence of secret operational capabilities developed by the military to locate , target and kill leaders of al qaeda in iraq and other insurgent leaders . national security adviser stephen hadley , in a written statement reacting to woodward 's book , acknowledged the new strategy . yet he disputed woodward 's conclusion that the `` surge '' of 30,000 u.s. troops into iraq was not the primary reason for the decline in violent attacks . `` it was the surge that provided more resources and a security context to support newly developed techniques and operations , '' hadley wrote . woodward , associate editor of the washington post , wrote that along with the surge and the new covert tactics , two other factors helped reduce the violence . watch bob woodward explain the strategy '' one was the decision of militant cleric muqtada al-sadr to order a cease-fire by his mehdi army . the other was the `` anbar awakening '' movement that saw sunni tribes aligning with u.s. troops to battle al qaeda in iraq . woodward told larry king that while there is a debate over how much credit the new secret operations should get for the drop in violence , he concluded it `` accounts for a good portion . '' `` i would somewhat compare it to the manhattan project in world war ii , '' he said `` it 's a ski slope right down in a matter of months , cutting the violence in half . this is n't going to happen with the bunch of joint security stations or the surge . '' the top secret operations , he said , will `` some day in history ... be described to people 's amazement . '' while he would not reveal the details , woodward said the terrorists who have been targeted were already aware of the capabilities . `` the enemy has a heads up because they 've been getting wiped out and a lot of them have been killed , '' he said . `` it 's not news to them . `` if you were a member of al qaeda or the resistance or some extremist militia , you would be wise to get your rear end out of town , '' woodward said . `` it is very dangerous . ''
889	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- journalist bob woodward describes in his new book a secret u.s. program to assassinate terrorists in iraq . cnn 's michael ware says , `` the u.s. subcontracted out an assassination program against al qaeda ... in early 2006 . '' woodward , an associate editor of the washington post , says in `` the war within : a secret white house history 2006-2008 '' that the assassination program , not the 2007 increase in u.s. forces in the war zone known as `` the surge , '' is primarily responsible for the reduction of violence in iraq . cnn baghdad correspondent michael ware cast doubt on woodward 's assertion tuesday in a conversation with `` american morning '' host john roberts . watch larry king on his talk with woodward '' john roberts : what do you think of what woodward is saying ? michael ware : let 's say that these `` fusion teams , '' as they 're being called , have come into effect . the first thing to say is , `` well , about time . '' on the ground you 've seen the lack of coordination as the left hand of one agency is not with the right hand of another agency within the american effort . but by and large , to suggest that anything like this being done now has been the major reason for the decline in violence is a bit rich . i mean , the u.s. subcontracted out an assassination program against al qaeda way back in early 2006 . and this was conceded by the then-chief of military intelligence in baghdad and by -lsb- u.s. -rsb- ambassador zalmay khalilzad himself . that 's what broke the back of al qaeda . then when america put 100,000-plus insurgents on the u.s. government payroll , including members of al qaeda , that not only took them out of the field , but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the iranian-backed militias . roberts : so it sounds like assassination was a real part of the program here , but was that the only thing that worked ? what about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up ? did it all kind of work together ? ware : it does work together . but the key to the downturn in violence that we 're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself . what it 's been is the segregation of baghdad into these enclaves . it 's been cutting a deal with muqtada al-sadr , the leader of the iranian-backed militia . and primarily it 's been putting your enemy on your payroll -- the sunni insurgents and many members of al qaeda . that 's what 's brought down the violence . this is your american militia , the counterbalance to the iranian militias . so if there 's new teams out there with new technology , great . but they 're riding the wave of previous success .
890	-lrb- cnn traveller -rrb- -- when the roman emperor hadrian came to power in 117ad he inherited an empire that was overstretched militarily and creaking at the seams . a massive bust of hadrian 's head unearthed only last year is part of the exhibition at the british museum . one of his first acts was to pull the troops out of mesopotamia , modern-day iraq , a fact that is sure to resonate with visitors to the british museum `` s superb exhibition `` hadrian : empire and conflict '' which opens on 24 july under the imposing classical dome of the reading room . curator torsten opper says : `` no matter what our take is on the conflict in iraq today , we can relate to hadrian 's decision . maybe 10 or 15 years ago , it would n't have mattered so much . now it does . '' hadrian was born in rome to a noble family whose origins lay in spain . one of the greatest of rome 's emperors , he consolidated imperial power , was a patron of architecture and travelled extensively across his lands . though married , he also took a homosexual lover , antinous , whose drowning in the river nile on the very day egyptians were celebrating the death in a similar manner of the god osiris remains one of ancient history 's great unsolved mysteries . the range of exhibits and their rarity means that this exhibition is going to be extremely well-attended . visitors will , for example , be the first members of the public anywhere to see a huge head of the emperor that was dug up recently at sagalassos in central turkey and would have once crowned a statue that was over five metres high . `` a year ago , this was still lying buried in the ground , '' says opper . `` it `` s proof that roman history is n't done and dusted ; that we are still able to rethink the past and evaluate it . '' the exhibition brings together 180 objects , from 31 sources in 11 different countries . `` it has n't been an easy thing to do , '' adds opper . `` many of these objects leave huge gaps in their home collection and many are extremely delicate . this is n't an exhibition that can travel . people will only be able to view it for these three months . '' many of the most delicate objects are also those that give the most dramatic insight into hadrian 's reign . between 132ad and 135/6ad the jews of judea rebelled against roman rule . some of the insurgents took refuge in a cave in the desert , called the cave of letters , in which they were trapped by roman troops . few made it out alive . the climatic conditions of the cave have preserved objects in astonishing condition . there is a letter written by jewish leader simon bar kokhba -lrb- enquiring about a delivery of supplies -rrb- , as well as mirrors , a jewellery box and an astonishingly delicate glass plate , probably made in alexandria , that somehow survived flight into the desert and the perilous climb up a cliff to the cave . then there are three house keys , their wooden handles preserved , looking as if they would still open the locks for which they were made . opper says : `` they `` re immediately touching -- these were used by people to lock their homes thinking they `` d be back in a week or two , but of course they were n't -- they all perished . and there are still many refugees now who still have keys to the homes they once lived in . it `` s a potent symbol of conflict . '' to the british hadrian will always be associated with the wall that was built across northern england , an 117km rampart with a fortification every 1.6 km . in schoolroom history this has traditionally been seen as a defence against the barbarian tribes to the north , but it was n't necessarily so . `` the wall was a ruthlessly efficient symbol of oppression and in the end it broke the back of the local tribes , '' says opper . confirmation of this , perhaps , comes from two small writing tablets from the fortress of vindolanda , the oldest surviving hand-written documents in the british isles . in one an officer , presumably writing to a colleague who is taking over his post , derides the locals as the `` little british , '' not worthy of worrying about very much - brief , battered and faded the letter may be , but as an example of high-handed imperialism it is hard to beat . click here to subscribe to cnn traveller . copyright © 2008 ink publishing and cable news network , lp , lllp , a time warner company . all rights reserved .
891	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- canada announced wednesday that it will dispatch a warship to somalia 's coast to protect u.n. aid ships from pirate attacks . the canadian frigate hmcs ville de quebec will escort ships carrying food aid to somalia . `` canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking ville de quebec with the role of escorting world food programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports , '' canadian defense minister peter mackay said in a government news release . the united nations hunger program praised canada for answering its call for help , and said it hoped other governments would step forward to take over from canada once it completes its mission in a few weeks . the hmcs ville de quebec is a 440-foot frigate armed with torpedoes , surface-to-air missiles and other weapons , and carries a twin-engine sea king anti-submarine helicopter . ville de quebec , which can travel at speeds greater than 27 knots , will be dispatched after somalia 's transitional government formally authorizes the mission , the government 's news release said . wfp asked the world 's naval powers in mid-june to help its ships reach the more than 2 million people in need of aid . it put out the request weeks before french , danish and dutch warships ended their escort missions , which began in november . pirate attacks on unescorted ships have been a growing problem in somalia . three european freighters were hijacked off the horn of africa in june , adding to the 27 other reported attacks this year , according to the international maritime bureau , which tracks piracy . wfp delivers 80 percent of its aid to somalia by sea , and wfp spokesman peter smerdon said that if there are no warships to escort the food supply , the program will have to rely on ground or air travel to deliver the food . but both are dangerous and expensive . the agency said that if there is no assistance from naval powers , piracy will increase , and so will death and malnutrition . smerdon said that although somalia 's food crisis has n't yet reached the devastation of the early 1990s , `` we 're worried it will be .

895	los angeles , california -lrb- ap -rrb- -- the shoe phone on tv 's `` get smart '' was n't just a sneaky spy gadget , it was a technological marvel : a wireless , portable telephone that could be used anywhere -- though it did require a dime to make a call . today , almost everyone has a pocket-sized version that also takes photos , shoots video , sends e-mail and surfs the internet . about the only thing it does n't do is protect your feet . `` get smart '' comes to the big screen next week , along with a spate of new spy gadgets to help maxwell smart , agent 99 and the other spies at control . the gadgets are just as goofy as they were in the original tv series , but because technology has caught up with the writers ' imaginations , there 's a big difference : many of the movie 's doo-dads actually exist . `` our favorite thing is to take something that does sort of exist and just exaggerate it a little bit , '' said matt ember , who co-wrote the script . the film shows a tiny ipod alongside spy-worthy stuff such as a two-way tooth radio and a digital `` spy fly '' -- all of which are available now . `` it 's pushed to a level of success that perhaps it has n't achieved in the real world , but it 's real , it 's out there , so that 's fun '' added co-writer tom j. astle , a self-described science nut . director peter segal said he originally could n't believe such devices were real . `` i said , ` that 's too silly . i do n't think people will buy it , '' ' he recalled telling the writers . `` then they googled it and it came up as an actual thing . '' astle and ember saw the tooth radio in a magazine and thought it was a perfect fit for the film . `` that 's an example of taking inspiration from the old series in spirit , '' astle said . `` the inherent comedy of having a microphone in your mouth -- it 's really close to your voice and it 's easy to yell and be too loud . '' the inextricable link between gadgets and spy movies began with james bond in 1962 , said tv historian tim brooks , author of `` the complete directory to prime time network and cable tv shows . '' the often-preposterous devices bond used added levity to a genre that `` had always been deadly serious '' during the early years of the cold war , brooks said . back in the day , `` get smart '' ratcheted up the goofiness level with bulletproof pajamas , a bunsen-burner phone and other wacky gadgets that often did n't work . when the show debuted in 1965 , the nation was future-focused and obsessed with the promise of technology . the show played on that obsession , brooks said , introducing dozens of covert gadgets and props designed to make life easier for cold war-era secret agents . a cigarette lighter doubled as a .22 - caliber gun . a lipstick could record conversations or release poisonous gas . then there was the famous shoe phone and the always-dysfunctional `` cone of silence '' that could -lrb- theoretically -rrb- keep conversations private , even in a crowded room . `` it 's nothing that you would expect to find or would even make sense in real life , and that 's the gag , '' brooks said . `` it was part of what the show was about . you 'd watch wondering what 's next , where 's the phone going to be next time . ... it was like a satire of our fixation with gadgets . '' the movie also takes liberties with some familiar devices , such as portable lasers , retinal scanners and a tricked-out swiss army knife equipped with a flame-thrower and a mini crossbow . despite living in a high-tech world , movie fans still love spy gadgets , the filmmakers said : just look at the success of the bond franchise , which will soon introduce its 22nd installment , and spy spoofs such as `` austin powers . '' part of it is the undercover element , part of it is a cultural love for technology , and part of it is wishful thinking . `` human beings are tool-users , '' astle said . `` we would like to believe that our government -- the good guys -- have within their power tools and electronic gadgets that will protect us that are beyond what we could do . '' `` there is some reality to it , '' ember said . `` we do have facial-recognition software , but on the other hand , i 'm not allowed to bring shampoo on an airplane . ''

'' osce chairman-in-office , finnish foreign minister alexander stubb , said : `` the intense fighting in the south ossetian conflict zone risks escalation into a full-fledged war . `` war would have a devastating impact for the entire region . i urge the georgians , south ossetians and russians to cease fire , end military action and stop further escalation . we need to pull back from the brink of a full-fledged war .

'' georgia , formerly part of the soviet union , is now looking west and has ambitions of joining nato . south ossetia has longed for and sometimes fought for independence since the 1920s when the soviet government made it an autonomous region within georgia . after the collapse of the soviet union , georgia broke away from moscow in 1991 and south ossetia voted overwhelmingly for its own independence . violence has been mounting in the region in recent days , with sporadic clashes between georgian forces and south ossetian separatists . georgian troops launched new attacks in south ossetia late thursday after a top government official said a unilateral cease-fire offer was met with separatist artillery fire . an emergency session of the u.n. security council on friday discussed the dramatic escalation of violence . the session ended friday morning without a statement about the fighting . copyright 2008 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .

'' the fbi description says mohammed was born in the comoros islands , and has used birth dates indicating he was born in either 1972 or 1974 . he also has citizenship in kenya , the description says . it adds , `` mohammed likes to wear baseball caps and tends to dress casually . he is very good with computers .

900	miami , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the storm called hanna weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm tuesday morning as maximum sustained winds eased down to 70 mph , the national hurricane center said . this satellite image from monday shows hanna over the southern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands . despite the downgrade , hanna dropped torrential rain on the eastern bahamas , the turks and caicos islands , and haiti . hurricane warnings remained in effect . hanna 's path and strength remain uncertain , but the latest forecast map from the national hurricane center predicts it still could make landfall as a major hurricane on the southeastern u.s. coast by friday evening . hanna 's path early tuesday appeared to be a `` meandering '' loop across turks and caicos , but atmospheric changes over the western atlantic are expected to steer the storm northwestward over the next two or three days , according to forecasters . as of 5 a.m. et , hanna was a category 1 storm on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with sustained winds of 80 mph -lrb- 129 kph -rrb- and gusts of up to 100 mph . ireport.com : watch hanna lash turks and caicos islands . three hours later , it was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds fell below the 74 mph threshold for hurricane status . it could return to hurricane status later tuesday or on wednesday , forecasters said . hanna 's line of fire could include the u.s. atlantic coast from miami , florida , to massachusetts , according to the hurricane center 's long-range forecast map . charleston , south carolina , appears in the middle of this `` cone of uncertainty , '' with hanna potentially making landfall there friday . `` it appears that the center has been meandering , '' forecasters said . the history of hurricanes that have been where hanna is now might argue against its heading toward the southeastern united states . none of the september storms that passed within 200 miles of hanna 's current location has gone there , with most heading into the gulf of mexico and others going to new england or nova scotia . still , forecasters said , `` the model guidance is remarkably well clustered '' in support of its forecast path for hanna . meanwhile , forecasters were keeping an eye on tropical storm ike , which was gaining strength in the mid-atlantic and appeared headed for the bahamas later in the week . it had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph tuesday morning .

'' as of early this week , there were 2,829 fema trailers in orleans parish , the mayor 's office said . the city has designated 17 sites for people without transportation to board buses that would take them out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation . the city also arranged with amtrak for more than 7,000 seats to evacuate the elderly by train , said jerry sneed of city homeland security and emergency preparedness . signs of mobilization were apparent at louis armstrong new orleans international airport , where nearly every departure gate had long lines of elderly people in wheelchairs . rental car counters normally attended by tourists were filled with relief workers from the red cross and the fire department of new york 's disaster assistance response team . the dart team consisted of retired new york firefighters , jovial men with graying hair and larger waistlines . many are volunteers assisting the red cross who were in new york during the september 11 attacks and wanted to give back . the 40-member dart team of heavy-equipment operators , truck drivers and registered nurses was headed to alexandria , louisiana , to set up an evacuation shelter . after the storm , the team will feed , shelter and re-supply people in the areas affected by gustav . `` whatever small way you 're able to help , it 's a great feeling , '' said kevin wallace , a 23-year fdny veteran who 's helped after six disasters . `` whatever they need us to do , we do . '' all 2,500 inmates in orleans parish would be bused out from state and local facilities , orleans parish criminal sheriff marlin gusman told the new orleans times-picayune . new orleans police chief warren riley said this week that hundreds of officers will be posted in the uptown , downtown , central city and west bank areas to ensure an adequate law enforcement presence in the event of an emergency . during katrina , many new orleans officers were accused of leaving their posts as widespread crime and looting permeated the city . sixty-seven officers were fired for it , riley said . in addition to the police department 's actions , at least 1,500 louisiana national guard members arrived in new orleans on friday . homeland security secretary michael chertoff said his concerns for new orleans are twofold . first , he was worried about areas of potential weakness in the levee system , which he said the army corps of engineers monitor closely , and second , rainfall . `` you can build levees that are 100 feet high ; it 's not going to keep the rain out of the city . a very , very intense period of rain could flood the city , because the pace of the rainfall could exceed the ability to pump out of the city , '' he said . the only thing to do was prepare , he said . `` we evacuate ; we protect the integrity of the levees ; we continue to strengthen the levees ; that 's part of a total system of really driving down the risk to the people of new orleans , '' he said . the louisiana national guard has requested 20 helicopters from eight states to replace its helicopter air assault battalion , which is now serving in iraq with its 20 uh-60 black hawks . the guard is asking for uh-60 helicopters for search and rescue , as well as ch-47s , chinooks , which could drop large sandbags if the levees are breached . a 40-person aviation headquarters unit also is being requested and probably will be provided by the arkansas national guard to handle air traffic control and communications for any air operations that might be needed . in texas , gov. rick perry pre-emptively declared an emergency in 61 texas counties . he said also the state had agreed to take into its shelters several thousand louisiana residents , should they evacuate . cnn 's john couwels , chris lawrence , barbara starr , eric marropodi and kim segal contributed to this report .
902	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- justice department officials blocked liberals and people with democratic party ties from a highly selective program that funneled young lawyers into government jobs , according to an internal investigation released tuesday . a bias against liberals existed in a justice program meant to hire young lawyers , an investigation found . esther slater mcdonald , a political appointee at the justice department , `` wrote disparaging statements about the candidates ' liberal and democratic party affiliations on the applications she reviewed and ... she voted to deselect candidates on that basis , '' said the report by inspector general glenn fine . mcdonald , who has left the department , refused to be interviewed for the investigation . the report , the first official investigation to document politicization of the justice department during the bush administration , is an offshoot of the larger investigation of justice department politics triggered by the furor over the firing of nine u.s. attorneys . it found two of three members of a screening committee considered political views and experience when choosing new lawyers for the justice department honors program and summer law intern program . the report found that mcdonald and michael elston , the chief of staff to deputy attorney general paul mcnulty , engaged in misconduct , an administrative violation . the third member of the screening committee , career lawyer dan fridman , was cleared of any involvement in the politicization of the process . elston was interviewed by the investigators , who asked him about the role of former justice department official monica goodling in politicizing the selection process . elston told investigators he could not recall goodling telling him to select lawyers who appeared to share attorney general alberto gonzales ' philosophy . goodling testified before a house panel last year that she had told elston he should identify such candidates . goodling directed elston to lead the selection committee in 2006 . she and elston have both left the justice department . she refused to be interviewed for the inspector general 's report . as a result of the controversy , the hiring process was changed in 2007 to insulate hiring decisions from political considerations . both justice department policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations . the report did not find clear evidence that an earlier screening committee took political considerations into account . it says data from 2002 shows a disparity in the hiring of liberal and conservative candidates , but there were no complaints about the committee 's work from 2003 to 2006 , when goodling put elston in charge of the process . the report tuesday is the first of perhaps several to be issued as the broad-ranging investigation into the role partisan politics has played in the justice department during the bush administration . goodling is expected to be a central figure in later inspector general reports examining efforts to increase the influence of conservatives in the department . the justice department office of professional responsibility , a separate watchdog office that monitors prosecutorial conduct , joined in the inspector general 's investigation . cnn 's terry frieden contributed to this report .

909	join roland martin for his weekly sound-off segment on cnn.com live at 10:30 a.m. et wednesday . if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you . roland martin says journalists do n't serve the public if they push rumors . -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the internet . one week before comedian bernie mac passed away , text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died . i was in new york , and friends and colleagues from chicago , illinois , to dallas , texas , and los angeles , california , were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead . the rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead , which was subsequently published by the chicago sun-times . what makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth , and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition . then there is the `` rumor '' of an affair by former north carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate john edwards . the story was broken by the national enquirer after months of digging . ultimately , a source came forward and was likely paid for the information that blew the lid off of the story ; the tabloid 's editor said `` you can assume '' the enquirer paid for it . the story exposed edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened . there has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet was n't able to verify the story and run with it . the heated discussions even reached the point where charlotte observer editor rick thames told pbs ' `` newshour with jim lehrer '' that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself , `` when rumor arises , we 're going to need to address it . and , unfortunately , we may need to address it before we can determine whether it 's true or not because it 's having impact , as it was in this case . '' sorry , rick , i disagree . the most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we do n't traffic in rumor and innuendo . none of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control . running with such rumors has far-reaching implications . just check out this month 's vanity fair , where bryan burroughs has a great story on the collapse of bear stearns . the investment bank 's demise , some conclude , was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems , even though it was sitting on $ 18 billion . the rumors kept going and going and when the story hit the airwaves , it spread like wildfire . in one week , bear stearns was no more , and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the wall street behemoth . we should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story . the rules are simple : either you have the facts or you do n't . if you do , you run with the story . if you do n't , you leave it alone . the national enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront edwards as he was leaving the beverly hills hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair . then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the enquirer said was the child of the mistress . with other major media outlets turning up the heat , edwards admitted the affair in an interview with abc 's bob woodruff . no media executive should be pulling his or her hair out , trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor . if they had , and the facts did n't support the rumor , then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more . we have an obligation to stick with the facts , and nothing else . and no matter what a blogger , web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with , the day we choose to alter our standards , our credibility and integrity will be shot . in the end , as former abc news anchor max robinson said in 1988 , that 's all we 've got . nothing is worth losing that , even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over . roland s. martin is an award-winning journalist and cnn contributor . he is the author of `` listening to the spirit within : 50 perspectives on faith .

914	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush condemned the escalated violence between russia and u.s.-backed georgia on sunday , while vice president dick cheney said aggression against georgia `` must not go unanswered . '' president bush chats with russian prime minister vladmir putin at the start of the olympic opening ceremonies . `` my administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire , '' bush told nbc 's bob costas in an interview in beijing , china , where the president has attended olympic events . bush was filmed speaking to russian prime minister vladimir putin during friday 's opening ceremonies and said sunday that he `` was firm with vladimir putin '' and that `` this violence is unacceptable . '' violence has continued to rage between russia and the western ally since thursday , when georgia launched an operation to crack down on separatists in south ossetia territory . russia said it wanted to protect its peacekeepers already in south ossetia following ceasefires in years past . but georgia called it a full-on invasion . and while russia has accused georgia of a genocidal plot to cleanse the region of ethnic ossetians loyal to russia , georgia accuses russia of executing a long-planned war with the aim of taking control of the region -- including a key pipeline that carries asian oil to black sea ports . `` i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia , '' bush said of his talk with putin . `` we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia . '' putin says he 's concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in russia from south ossetia . russian officials said more than 30,000 refugees have left south ossetia and crossed into russia over the past two days , interfax reported . `` the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are a crime , of course , primarily a crime against their own people , '' putin said , according to russian news agency interfax . meanwhile , cheney talked to georgian president mikheil saakashvili on sunday , telling him that russia 's aggression against georgia `` must not go unanswered . '' cheney 's spokeswoman lea ann mcbride said the vice president spoke to saakashvili to express `` the united states ' solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity . '' georgia withdrew its forces sunday and offered a ceasefire , which russia refused . `` the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered , and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states , as well as the broader international community , '' mcbride said . saakashvili has called on the united states and the world community to stop the `` intervention and invasion of my sovereign country . '' `` i think the u.s. is the most powerful country in the world , '' he told cnn . `` i think the u.s. has lots of leverage . and i think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through . '' two senior officials have told cnn the united states sent envoy matt bryza to the region to help with mediation .
915	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the new york times has rejected an essay that sen. john mccain wrote defending his iraq war policy . sen. john mccain wrote an op-ed for the new york times , but the paper said it could not publish it as written . the piece was in response to an op-ed from sen. barack obama that was published in the paper last week . in an e-mail to the mccain campaign , opinion page editor david shipley said he could not accept the piece as written , but would be `` pleased , though , to look at another draft . '' `` let me suggest an approach , '' he wrote friday . `` the obama piece worked for me because it offered new information -lrb- it appeared before his speech -rrb- ; while senator obama discussed senator mccain , he also went into detail about his own plans . it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obama 's piece . '' read mccain 's rejected piece . in a statement released monday , the new york times said it is `` standard procedure on our op-ed page , and that of other newspapers , to go back and forth with an author on his or her submission . '' `` we look forward to publishing senator mccain 's views in our paper just as we have in the past . we have published at least seven op-ed pieces by senator mccain since 1996 . the new york times endorsed senator mccain as the republican candidate in the presidential primaries . we take his views very seriously , '' the statement said . mccain 's rejected op-ed was a lengthy critique of obama 's positions on iraq policy , particularly his view of the surge . `` senator obama seems to have learned nothing from recent history , '' wrote mccain , criticizing obama 's call for an early withdrawal timeline . `` i find it ironic that he is emulating the worst mistake of the bush administration by waving the ` mission accomplished ' banner prematurely . '' watch why the piece was rejected '' obama 's july 14 essay had taken shots at mccain for not further encouraging the iraqi government to take control of the country . `` instead of seizing the moment and encouraging iraqis to step up , the bush administration and senator mccain are refusing to embrace this transition -- despite their previous commitments to respect the will of iraq 's sovereign government , '' obama wrote in his op-ed . `` they call any timetable for the removal of american troops ` surrender , ' even though we would be turning iraq over to a sovereign iraqi government . '' read obama 's essay . shipley , who was president bill clinton 's senior speechwriter from 1995 to 1997 , had advised the mccain campaign that `` the article would have to articulate , in concrete terms , how senator mccain defines victory in iraq . `` it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory -- with troops levels , timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate . and it would need to describe the senator 's afghanistan strategy , spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan . '' he added that he hoped the parties could `` find a way to bring this to a happy resolution . '' mccain spokesman tucker bounds said monday the arizona senator 's position will not change based on the `` demands of the new york times . '' `` john mccain believes that victory in iraq must be based on conditions on the ground , not arbitrary timetables , '' he said . `` unlike barack obama , that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the new york times . '' the newspaper endorsed mccain for the republican presidential nomination in january , shortly before the new york primary . in february , after it became clear mccain would be his party 's presumptive nominee , the paper published a thinly sourced report that mccain once had a close relationship with a female lobbyist . mccain said he was disappointed in the new york times piece . the paper said that it stood by its reporting and that `` the story speaks for itself . '' mccain 's campaign sent out fundraising appeals based on the article . the article `` is particularly disgusting -- an un-sourced hit-and-run smear campaign designed to distract from the issues at stake in this election , '' mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , wrote in a e-mail to supporters . `` we need your help to counteract the liberal establishment and fight back against the new york times by making an immediate contribution today , '' the e-mail said in text that linked to an online contribution form on the mccain campaign 's web site .
916	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there 's no question `` tropic thunder '' takes chances . ben stiller , left , and robert downey jr. are among the stars of `` tropic thunder , '' a hollywood satire . tom cruise almost unrecognizable as a foulmouthed , foul-mannered movie executive ? check . mockery of action heroes , method actors and gross-out comedians ? check . challenging stereotypes at every opportunity ? absolutely . but casting robert downey jr. as a black man ? well , that might be a bit much . or maybe not . in `` tropic thunder , '' a comedy about self-absorbed hollywood types making a `` platoon '' - style war movie , downey plays australian actor kirk lazarus , a multiple oscar-winning performer who gets so involved in his roles that he forgets to come out of them . he 's a man constantly looking for ways to transform himself for his art . so , cast as a black man in the war movie , lazarus decides to dye his skin surgically . downey -- no slouch as an actor himself -- has often been seen as one who immerses himself fully in his roles . that kind of dedication prevented the character from coming off as offensive , said ben stiller , who directed , co-wrote and stars in `` tropic thunder . '' `` i give all the credit to robert , '' stiller told cnn . `` i felt he really was so committed to that character , the guy that was playing that guy , that as an audience you bought his sincerity . very few people , i think , could pull that off . '' brandon jackson , who plays hip-hop star turned actor alpa chino -lrb- say it fast -rrb- , agreed . `` robert was black the whole time . my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle , '' he told cnn . `` i 'm serious . that 's how black he was . '' watch jackson talk about working with downey '' the movie , which also stars stiller as struggling action star tugg speedman and jack black as gross-out king jeff portnoy , features some testy altercations between downey 's lazarus and jackson 's chino . lazarus gets so involved in his role that even when it 's clear filming has wrapped for the day , he sticks with it -- which irritates chino to no end . `` to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what he 's doing is crazy the whole time , '' downey said . `` otherwise it 's just demeaning to brandon 's character . and if it 's demeaning to an actual black man in the movie ... i would have run for the hills . '' jackson said he would have challenged the movie if the material was offensive . but , he said , `` tropic thunder '' is a long way from the days when white performers would don blackface as a way of exploiting black stereotypes . since then , he said , the playing field has leveled : the wayans brothers played `` white chicks '' in the film of the same name , and eddie murphy has played several ethnicities in his films , including jewish and chinese characters . `` if we 're all gon na play ball , let 's all play ball , '' jackson said . `` i believe in fairness . if we can punch you , punch back . and funny is funny . '' ireport.com : will you see ` tropic thunder ' ? stiller , of course , is no stranger to testing comedy limits . the actor , writer and director , known for films such as `` meet the parents '' and `` zoolander , '' has performed or created roles that strike a delicate balance between sympathetic and distasteful -- and sometimes fall too hard on one side of the line . he co-wrote `` tropic thunder '' based on an idea he had in 1987 , when many of his friends were making war movies , he recalls in the film 's production notes . while stiller was making `` empire of the sun , '' his colleagues were in boot camps training for their military roles -- and would emerge talking about the boot camp as if they 'd become part of a real military unit . `` this sort of self-important , self-involved thing seemed funny to me , '' he said in the notes . `` i just could n't figure a way to make that into a movie . '' not immediately , anyway . but after several years , stiller and his colleagues worked out a story that not only mocked actors , but filmmaking in general . in `` thunder , '' after the studio threatens to shut down the big-budget production , the frustrated director -lrb- played by steve coogan -rrb- refuses to stop , and takes his cast deep into a southeast asia jungle to shoot `` guerrilla style . '' there they encounter danger in the form of drug lords . `` tropic thunder , '' which already has received praise from newsweek 's david ansen and the hollywood reporter 's kirk honeycutt , has also earned its share of knocks . the most serious have come from advocacy groups for the disabled , which are planning to picket monday 's los angeles premiere . in the film , speedman has made a bid for an oscar by playing `` simple jack , '' a developmentally disabled character . other characters in `` tropic thunder '' dismiss speedman 's attempt to play what they refer to as a `` retard . '' representatives of the special olympics , the arc of the united states , the national down syndrome congress , the american association of people with disabilities and other groups met with studio executives last week to discuss the film , but dreamworks did not make any changes . `` we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population , '' said peter wheeler , a spokesman for the special olympics , according to reuters . in a statement sunday , chip sullivan , a dreamworks spokesman , said the movie was `` an r-rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the-top characters in ridiculous situations . '' in the statement , sullivan added that the film was not meant to disparage or harm people with disabilities and that dreamworks expected to work closely with disability groups in the future . in junket interviews for the film , stiller said that screening audiences definitely found `` tropic thunder '' funny . `` you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think you 're doing , of what you think is the right idea , '' he said . `` if people are accepting it the way that you intended , and you feel that from a general audience ... then stand behind it . '' downey trusts that after years of making themselves known as actors who can skillfully walk that fine line between funny and offensive , audiences will accept the film 's satire -- his role in particular . `` i just hope at this point , with whatever little we 've done to brand ourselves as entertainers , that you give us a little slack , '' he said . cnn entertainment correspondent kareen wynter contributed to this report .

918	like nearly everything else clinton-related this week , hillary clinton 's convention speech remained a question mark until the last minute . the overriding goal for hillary clinton on tuesday night was to redirect her supporters toward barack obama . its content was a mystery to even some of her closest advisers , who told cnn hours before the speech they were n't sure it was finished quite yet . it was a work in progress until the very end -- and one of its strongest rallying cries appeared nowhere in the prepared text . `` that is our mission , democrats -- let us elect barack obama and joe biden , '' the new york senator told a capacity crowd waving signs that said `` unity '' on one side and bore either clinton 's or obama 's name on the other . so far , the democratic convention has been dominated by news of the clintons . what would hillary clinton say tuesday night ? and what would her husband , former president bill clinton , say wednesday night ? would daughter chelsea introduce her mother onstage , fueling visions of another democratic dynasty ? and what will happen wednesday , when the convention roll call will either provide the `` catharsis '' clinton predicted it might -- or reopen primary season wounds ? watch clinton 's entire speech '' the overriding goal for clinton tuesday night was to redirect the energy and emotion of her strongest supporters to the presumptive nominee 's campaign -- if not for his political future , for her own . if the rank-and-file believe a schism in the party generated by her supporters cost democrats the election , it could sabotage any potential white house plans for her . she pushed for her loyalists to back her primary season rival with language that echoed her stump speech about forgotten americans : . `` i want you to ask yourselves : were you in this campaign just for me ? '' she asked . `` or were you in it for that young marine and others like him ? were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids ? were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage ? were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible ? '' read what analysts say about clinton 's speech . she gave obama the seal of approval on health care , an issue that made for some of her toughest language on the trail . `` i ca n't wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american , '' she said . there were a few notable gaps . there was little on foreign policy . there was no unequivocal statement that barack obama is qualified to be commander in chief and ready to lead from day one . mccain advisers noted soon after the speech , there was no mention of the candidates ' differing stands on abortion -- one issue which might have been expected to resonate with those women who supported clinton and have been slow to warm to obama . but clinton 's language about what was at stake this november could have been lifted from a speech by any of the most passionate obama supporters . `` nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance , '' she told the crowd . `` i want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day . and think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation . '' clinton has not addressed whether another presidential campaign is possible anytime in her future , but some of her senior advisers have been less reticent . there 's no way to tell whether their predictions come from inside knowledge or wishful thinking , but senior clinton aides like former campaign chairman terry mcauliffe and former campaign communications director howard wolfson have told reporters this week that they expect her to make another run for the white house in eight years -- after a two-term obama presidency . if that happens , tuesday night may have marked the first speech of her 2016 campaign .
919	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal regulators announced $ 7.1 million in fines against american airlines on thursday over maintenance issues and problems with its drug - and alcohol-testing programs . american airlines was fined for allowing aircrafts to fly while they knew they needed repairs . `` the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed , and instead deferred maintenance , '' the federal aviation administration said in a statement announcing the decision . `` in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft , the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew . '' american can still appeal the fines , the faa said . the faa also found the airline maintained inadequate drug - and alcohol-testing programs and failed to inspect safety lighting on a `` timely '' basis . the fort worth , texas-based carrier said thursday evening that it disagreed with the findings and called the penalties `` excessive .

'' nearly $ 4.5 million of the proposed fines stem from american 's continued operation of two md-83 jetliners in december 2007 after pilots reported problems with the autopilot systems , the faa said . the two planes were flown a combined 58 times before the problems were corrected -- and one flew 10 times after an faa inspector notified the airline that it had wrongly deferred needed repairs . in one incident , the autopilot disconnected during a landing on december 21 , the faa said . `` american technicians did not check for the actual problem , and instead deferred maintenance using an inappropriate mel -lrb- minimum equipment list -rrb- item . the plane flew another 36 passenger-carrying flights during december 21-31 . '' the problem was later traced to a piece of radio gear separate from the autopilot , the faa said . meanwhile , a different md-83 flew four flights without a fully functioning autopilot after american mechanics put off repairs . regulators also accuse american of operating planes without timely inspections of their emergency lighting systems . in april , american canceled more than 3,000 flights to conduct inspections of wiring bundles in wheel wells of its 300 md-80 jets , snarling air traffic for five days . the faa ordered american and several other airlines to examine the wiring , which had the potential to start fires or cause landing gear to malfunction .

922	cern , switzerland -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- scientists wednesday applauded as one of the most ambitious experiments ever conceived got successfully underway , with protons being fired around a 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- tunnel deep beneath the border of france and switzerland in an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe . scientists applaud during the switch on operation of the large hadron collider . the large hadron collider -- a $ 9 billion particle accelerator designed to simulate conditions of the big bang that created the physical universe -- was switched on at 0732 gmt to cheers and applause from experts gathered to witness the event . while observers were left nonplussed by the anticlimactic flashing dots on a tv screen that signalled the machine 's successful test run , among teams of scientists involved around the world there were jubilant celebrations and popping champagne corks . in the coming months , the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions . skeptics , who claim that the experiment could lead to the creation of a black hole capable of swallowing the planet , failed in a legal bid to halt the project at cern , the european organization for nuclear research . others have branded it a colossal waste of cash , draining resources from its multinational collaborators that could have been spent on scientific research with more tangible benefits to mankind . sound off : what do you think of the experiment ? french president nicolas sarkozy hailed the project as a major achievement for europe . `` the repercussions of this scientific investment without precedent in the history of humanity will be essential not only for the intimate knowledge of our universe , but also for the direct applications in fields as varied as intensive calculation or even medicine , '' he said . watch as big bang experiment gets underway '' the collider will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year , potentially generating enough data to make a discovery by 2009 , experts say . they say the experiment has the potential to confirm theories that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions . they also hope to find a theoretical particle called the higgs boson -- sometimes referred to as the `` god particle , '' which has never been detected , but would help explain why matter has mass . the collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the big bang , when there was a hot `` soup '' of tiny particles called quarks and gluons , to look at how the universe evolved , said john harris , u.s. coordinator for alice , a huge detector specialized to analyze that question . since this is exploratory science , the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories , but which are just as interesting , said joseph lykken , theoretical physicist at the fermi national accelerator laboratory . `` when columbus sails west , he thought he was going to find something . he did n't find what he thought he was going to find , but he did find something interesting , '' said lykken , who works on the compact muon solenoid , one of six experiments inside the collider complex . why should the layperson care about this particular exploration ? years ago , when electrons were first identified , no one knew what they were good for , but they have since transformed our entire economy , said howard gordon , deputy research program manager for the collider 's atlas experiment . `` the transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better , '' said gordon , at brookhaven national laboratory . `` it 's important for just who we are , what we are . '' fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole earth . such fears prompted legal actions in the u.s. and europe to halt the operation of the large hadron collider , alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge . although physicists acknowledge that the collider could , in theory , create small black holes , they say they do not pose any risk . a study released friday by cern scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny , and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving . five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told cnn there would be no danger from potential black holes . john huth , who works on the collider 's atlas experiment , called such fears `` baloney '' in a recent interview , and noted that in normal physics , even if the black hole were stable , it could just pass through the earth without being detected or without interacting at all . `` the gravitational force is so weak that you 'd have to wait many , many , many , many , many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could -lsb- get -rsb- big enough to even get close to being a problem , '' said huth , professor of physics at harvard university . cnn 's elizabeth landau contributed to this story .

'' while finding out the hard way how funny , or not , he was , chinn was working front-of-house in restaurants , nurturing his love of food . his break came when hubert keller from san francisco restaurant fleur de lys took him on as a volunteer in his kitchen . `` he gave me a job and after one week he said ` ok , you can stay . ' and then when you work with one really great chef , then i think you can work anywhere , '' he said . after also training with chefs in france , chinn made his own mark on the culinary world when he opened his first restaurant in vietnam in 1995 , and at first found the going tough . `` supplies were not consistent , the language barrier , the taste barrier , the hygiene barriers . those are very taxing on a person like me with very little patience . '' a high-energy chef and now a tv celebrity who presents `` world café asia '' -- he won an asian television award in 2007 -- chinn is aware that being flavor of the month on tv is transitory . `` it is just a machine that feeds on people like me and then spits me out when my time is done . you just have to go with the flow .

925	la paz , bolivia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- five of bolivia 's nine states staged a civic strike tuesday , protesting against president evo morales and demanding a larger share of the country 's natural gas revenues . members of santa cruz 's juvenile union burn wood during protests tuesday in santa cruz , bolivia . officials in santa cruz , beni , pando , tarija -- states in the wealthy , eastern lowland known as the `` media luna , '' or half-moon -- and chuquisaca , also in the eastern part of the country , instructed residents not to leave their homes until the end of the one-day strike , bolivian newspaper el diario reported . the five departments contain much of the andean country 's natural gas deposits , and their leaders are asking for natural gas revenue that morales has earmarked to increase funding for pension plans , the five regions said in a statement on the strike posted on santa cruz 's web site . they said they were `` sorry that the inflexibility of the government forced the prefectures to take this type of resolution . '' confrontations between government supporters and pro-autonomy groups in a santa cruz neighborhood appeared to be the day 's most violent . police fired tear gas three times at demonstrators . in the other four departments where the strike was being observed , there were no disturbances . the 24-hour strike was called by civil committees of the departments to demand that the government give back the money it has collected by taxing hydrocarbons in order to fund the pension plan . the president of santa cruz 's civic committee , branco marincovick , said the tax is constraining regional development . the government condemned acts of violence during the day and said that the strike was limited . the strike comes nine days after morales garnered more than 67 percent of votes in a recall referendum , which he had proposed in may to break a power struggle long simmering between him and the conservative leadership in the media luna states . despite the solid show of support for morales , the vote also endorsed the leaders in santa cruz , pando , beni and tarija , making it impossible to reach a solution to the stalemate . morales , a former labor organizer and the country 's first indigenous president , was elected in 2005 on promises to reform bolivia 's constitution for the benefit of its indigenous majority . but his proposals have been hampered by his rivals in the media luna states . since taking office , all four have pushed for greater autonomy , saying the individual departments have the right to control their own affairs , including increased access to gas revenues . in speaking about the revenues earmarked for increased pensions , morales emphasized that it was for the good of the people , a refrain he often uses . `` some authorities believe that this money is theirs , and it is not so , this silver is of the people and should benefit the people , '' the president said last year , shortly after he announced the measure . mark weisbrot , co-director of the washington-based center for economic and policy research , a nonpartisan think-tank , said morales ' overwhelming victory at the polls strengthens his hand at achieving his goal of redistributing wealth . less than one percent of landowners in bolivia own two-thirds of the country 's farmland , he said in an article published in the nation magazine . `` bolivia is south america 's poorest country , with 60 percent of the population living below the poverty line , and 38 percent in extreme poverty , '' he said . `` the voters have overwhelmingly decided that they want their government to do something about that . this should be possible , even if it means redistributing some of the country 's most important natural resources .

927	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- rare images of an african animal so elusive that it was once believed to be mythical have been released . one of the first pictures of the elusive okapi was taken by camera trap . the okapi is a shy animal related to the giraffe , with zebra-like stripes on its rear . it is native to the tropical rainforests of africa but is now known to live only in the democratic republic of the congo . okapis were last seen in the drc 50 years ago , and the images are the first to capture the animal in the wild . `` to have captured the first-ever photographs of such a charismatic creature is amazing , '' said noelle kumpel , manager of the bushmeat and forests conservation program at the zoological society of london , which took the pictures . `` okapi are very shy and rare animals , which is why conventional surveys only tend to record droppings and other signs of their presence . '' the okapi 's face and long legs resemble those of the giraffe , their closest-living relative , but they look more like horses with long necks . the average height of their shoulders is 1.6 meters -lrb- 5 feet , 3 inches -rrb- , the zsl says . they have a short , dense , velvety coat and dark prehensile tongue long enough to clean their own eyelids and ears . the new pictures show the okapi in the foliage of the drc 's virunga national park , where decades of economic collapse and armed conflict have threatened the diverse wildlife . in one image , an okapi looks curiously toward the camera amid the green trees and groundcover . its large ears , dark nose , and zebra stripes are clearly visible . the next shot shows the okapi walking away from the camera , giving a clear view of its striking black-and-white stripes on its rear legs . a third image released by zsl was taken at night and gives a vivid side view of the animal . `` the photographs clearly show the stripes on their rear , which act like unique fingerprints , '' said theirry lusenge , a key member of zsl 's survey team in the drc . `` we have already identified three individuals , and further survey work will enable us to estimate population numbers and distribution in and around the park , which is a critical first step in targeting conservation efforts . '' zsl said the images prove the okapi still thrives in the park despite threats to its survival , which include poaching , deforestation , military camps inside the park , and the influx of refugees at the park 's borders . the animal 's exact status is still a mystery , however , and it remains under threat , the zsl said . okapi meat reportedly poached from the park is now regularly on sale at the nearby town of beni -- and if hunting continues at the same rate , okapi could become extinct within the park within a few years , the zsl said . the virunga national park is one of only three protected areas the okapi are known to inhabit , the zsl said . the zsl 's study of the okapi is part of a larger eu-funded conservation project in the park . though focused on okapi , the study has also managed to find other species including shrews and duikers , a kind of antelope , a zsl spokeswoman said . the study involved 18 cameras set up around the park by the zsl and the congolese institute for nature conservation , the spokeswoman said . the announcement comes a month after another group of researchers reported finding thousands of previously-unknown gorillas in the neighboring republic of congo . the u.s.-based wildlife conservation society said in august they had found 125,000 western lowland gorillas living in a swamp in northern congo , adding significantly to the existing worldwide population of the threatened species . okapi were well known by africans for centuries but the animal remained elusive , thanks to its acute hearing and effective camouflage , according to the national zoological gardens of south africa . nineteenth-century explorers sometimes caught a fleeting glimpse of the okapi 's striped backside as it ran through the forest , leading to speculation that it was a kind of zebra , the national zoological gardens says . it was known to the pygmy as a sacred animal . still , the okapi remained unknown to the western world until the early 20th century , when british explorer harry johnston went to congo and sent a complete skin and skull back to britain , the zsl said .

943	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- hillary clinton 's campaign has apologized for `` inappropriate '' language used by her husband in response to what it called an `` outrageously unfair '' article about the former president . bill and hillary clinton campaign in sioux falls , south dakota , on monday . the article , by vanity fair magazine 's national editor todd purdum , suggested that bill clinton 's personality had changed since his 2004 heart bypass surgery and said that there were reports of clinton `` seeing a lot of women on the road . '' purdum quoted four anonymous former clinton aides saying that another of his former assistants had conducted `` what one of these aides called an intervention '' about the reports of philandering . a writer for the huffington post , mayhill fowler , asked clinton on monday what he thought `` about that hatchet job somebody did on you in vanity fair , '' according to a recording of the exchange posted on the huffington post 's web site . listen to clinton call the reporter a `` scumbag '' '' '' -lsb- he 's -rsb- sleazy , '' clinton responded . `` he 's a really dishonest reporter . '' clinton said he had not read the article but that he was told that `` there 's five or six just blatant lies in there . but he 's a real slimy guy . '' watch larry king panel debate bill clinton 's response '' calling purdum a `` scumbag , '' clinton said `` he 's one of the guys that propagated all those lies about whitewater for kenneth starr . he 's just a dishonest guy -- ca n't help it . '' purdum `` did n't use a single name , he did n't cite a single source in all those things he said , '' said the former president , who added that the article was `` part of the national media 's attempt to nail hillary for -lsb- barack -rsb- obama . '' he said readers should be wary of news accounts that rely on unnamed sources . `` anytime you read a story that slimes a public figure with anonymous quotes , it ought to make the bells go off in your head , '' he said . late monday , jay carson , a spokesman for hillary clinton 's campaign , said that `` president clinton was understandably upset about an outrageously unfair article , but the language today was inappropriate and he wishes he had not used it . '' purdum , a former new york times reporter who covered the clinton white house and is now married to former clinton press secretary dee dee myers , defended his article on cnn 's `` the situation room '' monday . he told cnn 's wolf blitzer he was `` very careful to say there is no clear-cut evidence that president clinton has done anything improper . '' watch cnn 's wolf blitzer interview purdum '' `` i reject the notion that i 'm making an insinuation , '' purdum said . `` but i 'm very comfortable quoting the people i quote because i know who they are , and i know that they are very senior people who have known president clinton for a very long time and work for him at very high levels . '' in his article , purdum quotes a johns hopkins cardiologist -- who was not involved in clinton 's health care -- who says that the former president 's bypass surgery could have affected his mood , perhaps even causing depression . and on cnn , purdum quoted `` some people who work for him '' saying that clinton `` seems to be angry all the time . '' purdum added he himself believes there 's evidence the former president is acting in a different manner . `` i think there 's a good deal of evidence that he is quite a bit angrier than he used to be , '' he said . `` he 's clearly very angry at the media , and he 's very angry at the way he sees sen. clinton 's campaign has been treated . '' `` i do n't suggest that anyone can say -- except perhaps his own doctors over time -- with certainty that -lsb- the surgery -rsb- has affected president clinton , '' he said . `` but again , this article involves reporting with a whole bunch of people who have worked for bill clinton over many years . and this is one of the things they raised with me . i did n't go raising this . '' clinton 's office issued a rebuttal of purdum 's article that decried his use of `` one doctor who has never examined president clinton . '' `` this theory is false and is flatly rejected by president clinton 's doctors who say he is in excellent shape and point to his vigorous schedule as evidence of his exceptional recovery , '' the rebuttal said . watch analyst james carville 's take on the article '' the lengthy article hits newsstands later this week , though vanity fair has already posted a copy on its web site . the posting prompted a blistering response from carson , who called the piece `` journalism of personal destruction at its worst . '' `` a tawdry , anonymous quote-filled attack piece , published in this month 's vanity fair magazine regarding former president bill clinton repeats many past attacks on him , ignores much prior positive coverage , includes numerous errors , and ultimately breaks no new ground , '' he said . purdum last year wrote an article about efforts by sen. john mccain , now the presumptive republican nominee for president , to draw in the party 's more conservative voters . cnn 's alex mooney contributed to this report .
944	harare , zimbabwe -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- zimbabwe 's inflation rate has soared in the past three months and is now at 11.2 million percent , the highest in the world , according to the country 's central statistical office . zimbabwe 's inflation rate has soared to a world high . official figures dated monday show inflation has surged from the rate of 2.2 million percent recorded in may , despite the government 's price controls . the country 's finance minister confirmed the new figure in an interview but said the rising inflation rate was not confined to zimbabwe alone . `` while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio-fuel , '' said samuel mumbengegwi . `` but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic . '' in february , the price of a loaf of bread in the country was less than 200,000 zimbabwe dollars . on monday , that same loaf of bread cost 1.6 trillion zimbabwe dollars . analysts have said the zimbabwean government 's official inflation rate figures are conservative . last week , one of zimbabwe 's leading banks , kingdom bank , said the country 's inflation rate was now more than 20 million percent . the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment in an economy that has been in freefall for almost a decade . once considered the breadbasket of africa , zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the country embarked on a chaotic land reform program that has decimated commercial agriculture . analysts say the crisis has worsened following president robert mugabe 's disputed reelection in the june 27 presidential run-off . his challenger morgan tsvangirai boycotted the race over widespread allegations of violence and voter intimidation . the economic crisis has destroyed zimbabwe 's currency and made it difficult for zimbabweans to buy basic commodities , electricity , fuel , and medicines . many zimbabweans have left the country amid rising unemployment and deepening poverty . last week a summit in south africa of regional african leaders failed to persuade zimbabwe 's political parties to agree to form a government of national unity , which observers view as the best way to end zimbabwe 's record recession .
945	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- six people were killed and 13 wounded in the shelling of south ossetia by georgian forces , south ossetian officials said saturday , according to russia 's interfax news agency . officials of the breakaway georgian region said the shelling was part of a georgian military operation , interfax reported . georgia initially suggested russian peacekeepers were to blame , drawing heated denials from the russian defense ministry , which called the allegation `` dirty informational provocation . '' later , however , mamuka kurashvili , the commander of georgian peacekeeping operations , told reporters that four people were wounded when several georgian villages were fired upon from south ossetia , and georgia `` had to return fire . '' women , children and the elderly were being evacuated from the conflict zone because of fears that georgia would continue military operations against the region , according to the south ossetian information and press committee as reported by interfax . south ossetia 's government held a special session on the violence , the russian news agency said . `` if georgia continues provocative actions , we will announce the recruitment of volunteers not only in the north ossetia but in the entire north caucasus and also carry out general mobilization in south ossetia , '' south ossetian leader eduard kokoity told interfax . georgia , located on the black sea coast between russia and turkey , has been split by russian-backed separatist movements in south ossetia and another region , abkhzia . accusations often fly on both sides , and the south ossetian leadership has alleged that georgian troops stage attacks to create a pretext for military action . south ossetia declared its independence from georgia in the early 1990s after a bloody war there between ethnic georgians and ossetians . the region 's independence is not internationally recognized . russian , georgian and south ossetian troops participate in a mixed peacekeeping force there and have maintained a fragile peace broken occasionally by fighting . on friday , as reports of the shelling began , russia expressed `` its most serious concern about the escalation of tensions in south ossetia . '' moscow said it was taking measures to prevent escalation of the conflict as it urged both georgia and south ossetia to look for diplomatic ways to calm the situation .
946	new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- three weeks after an apparent misunderstanding sparked a confrontation , deadly hindu-christian riots continue unabated in the remote east indian state of orissa . police officers chase away a protester in mangalore , india , monday . by tuesday , about 20 deaths had been reported , said praveen kumar , the superintendent of police in the worst-affected kandhamal district . the latest casualty is a police officer who died after an armed mob of about 400 to 500 mostly hindus torched a police station in the district on monday , orissa state police said . orissa 's director general of police g.c. nanda the policeman died when the mob opened fire at officers fleeing the burning building . the attack , he said , may have been in retaliation for arrests that police made in the ongoing communal fighting . watch more about the riots in india '' the attack came two days after police fired on a crowd to prevent it from attacking christian residents . between three and six people died in the shooting , cnn 's sister network cnn-ibn reported . the violence spread to southern india over the weekend when vandals attacked 14 churches in an hour in the state of karnataka sunday , the network said . the christian community in the karnataka -- numbering about 2.5 million -- said right-wing hindus are targeting them for opposing the violence in orissa . by tuesday , police had arrested about 140 people in connection with the riots , said karnataka 's inspector general of police a.m. prasad . sixty of them -- all hindus -- were arrested for the church attacks , prasad said . the rest , mostly christians , were charged with disturbing the peace , he said . orissa has historically been a tinderbox of hindu-christian tensions . some hindu groups view the work of christian missionaries in the state with suspicion . they accuse missionaries of bribing or forcing hindus into converting . the seeds for the current conflict were planted on august 23 , when hindu leader , laxmananda saraswati , and four others were killed in kandhamal after 20 to 30 gunmen barged into a hindu school and began shooting , the orissa chief minister 's office said . the authorities have not determined who killed saraswati , but after the incident they detained five people who are christians , said sukanta panda , spokesman for the chief minister . the government says the killings may have been the work of maoist rebels -- investigators have many unanswered questions -- but some hardline hindus blamed a christian minority . they took to the streets in anger , rampaging through predominantly christian neighborhoods , ransacking shops and torching houses . they chopped down trees to block roads , making it difficult for police to reach trouble spots . a christian orphanage was set on fire . a 20-year-old woman , who was teaching children inside , burned to death . christian residents fought back , and the clashes spread . authorities imposed a night curfew in many towns and deployed state and federal forces in the troubled areas , kumar -- the police superintendent -- said . both sides said the violence has left christian churches and hindu temples razed to the ground . this is not the first time the simmering anger has boiled over in the state with deadly consequences . in 1999 , a hindu mob burned to death an australian missionary , graham staines , and his two children while they slept inside their car . and last christmas , clashing groups killed four people and burned several churches in the same orissa district -- kandhamal . maoist rebels , who claim to be fighting for the poor and the dispossessed , have been battling the indian government in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties since the late 1960s . some christians accept the maoist theory , saying the rebels have also struck against hard-line hindus because they associate them as being closely aligned with the government . but hindu groups insists that christians were behind saraswati 's death . unlike orissa , karnataka has until now been spared the large-scale clash between christians and hindus . but now , many in the christian community fear their calm and prosperous state may become another battleground between the two religions , cnn-ibn said . cnn 's harmeet singh contributed to this report .

'' his wife sobs as she says her stepson 's death was foreshadowed by a phone call he made to her from iraq . `` he said that he was more shaky sometimes of the soldiers than of the enemy , because of the young guys over there . '' she said she asked him , `` what in the world do you mean ? you 're afraid of your own soldiers ? '' '' ` these kids are trying to fight a war they know nothing about . ... they 're jumpy . ... they 're more scary than the enemy , ' '' she said he told her . `` and i said , ` oh , god , ' '' said maxine mathis . on any given day , cnn receives dozens of detailed news releases from the u.s. military , including those announcing u.s. military casualties . in the cases of dawson and durbin , there was no mention of their names , and the releases were terse . `` a multi-national division center soldier died this morning of non-combat related causes , '' the first release read . `` the cause of death is under investigation . '' a second release came later in the day . `` a second multi-national division center soldier died this morning of non-combat related causes . the solider died of wounds september 14 at a coalition forces combat army support hospital , '' it read . `` the incident is under investigation . '' inquiries thursday from cnn were met with a news release that a press officer said had been drafted wednesday . however , the release had not been e-mailed to reporters wednesday , as is customary . after naming the two soldiers and giving their rank and unit , it reads , `` a u.s. soldier is in custody in connection with the shooting deaths . he is being held in custody pending review by a military magistrate . the incident continues under investigation . '' the release gives no other details . the u.s. military is classifying the death of sgt. dawson as `` non-hostile , '' something dawson 's father finds puzzling . `` i do n't know . i really do n't know , '' he said . `` i just ca n't get it together with that . i had never heard that before . ` non-hostile ' in a war zone ? '' lt. col. paul swiergosz is a public affairs officer for the area in iraq where the incident took place . he says the `` non-hostile '' death classification was given `` because the deaths were not the result of hostile enemy action . '' but details on what happened remain scarce . after asking , cnn received an e-mail press release from gen. tony cucolo , commanding general of the third infantry division that a press officer said had been drafted on wednesday . the release , however , had not been e-mailed to reporters , as is customary . `` we do know one soldier , a fellow noncommissioned officer , allegedly opened fire and mortally wounded his squad leader and fellow team leader , '' reads the statement . a spokesman at fort stewart in georgia said , `` a soldier has been taken into custody . the incident is under investigation , and that is all i can say . '' the spokesman would not even confirm information in his commanding general 's press statement . maxine mathis says she is stunned at how her stepson 's death has been handled by the military . she says the army assigned someone to help the family with anything they needed once they found out darris had been killed , but she and her husband do n't know how he died . she said her husband asked the liaison officer whether it was true that darris had been killed by another u.s. solider . she said the officer denied it , insisting he did n't know anything else . darryl mathis continues to express his disappointment in the lack of information from the military about his son , amid rumors his son 's body could be home by saturday . `` i do n't even know where he 's at , at this time , '' he said . bobby muller , president of veterans for america , said he thinks the way the military classifies deaths in iraq is an attempt to keep the public combat numbers down . `` there is a clear and long-standing record , regarding the classification of causalities in iraq to minimize combat losses . and we 're seeing people wounded and killed that would have well been considered casualties from hostile action in previous conflicts . it 's an attempt to conceal the actual cost of this war in terms of casualties , '' muller said . `` the department of defense has announced the death of every service member who has given their life in operation iraqi and enduring freedom , '' said a pentagon spokesman , col. gary keck . `` we have been open and transparent on the numbers of casualties suffered in these operations . '' mathis says his son wanted to come home to his wife and four young children and was in the process of applying for a transfer . `` last i spoke to him was last week monday . he called every monday , and said he was checking his paperwork . he said he was going to call me back once he found out . that was the last i heard from him .

949	buenos aires , argentina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- when susana trimarco 's daughter marita veron was 23 , she vanished from their hometown in argentina , a suspected victim of a human trafficking and prostitution ring with links throughout latin america and europe . marita veron , who is missing , hugs her daughter micaela . police believe marita was forced into sexual slavery . trimarco , 54 , has spent the past 6 1/2 years searching for her daughter , often putting herself at risk . while chasing down leads on marita 's whereabouts , she 's entered dark and dangerous brothels and confronted pimps and politicians who , she says , are complicit in her daughter 's disappearance . she has won accolades throughout latin america , europe and the united states for her work . but marita is nowhere to be found . `` marita is a wonderful and caring girl . my life will be completely absorbed with this fight until she is back and safe , '' trimarco said . on april 3 , 2002 , veron left her house in the northern argentine province of tucuman early for a doctor 's appointment . she was wearing a turquoise shirt , blue jeans and old white sneakers . as she left the house , she told her mother , `` do n't worry . i 'll be back soon . '' those were the last words the two exchanged . the investigation that has followed has led police and trimarco to believe that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution , either in rural argentina or spain . so far , a series of random clues has failed to provide any concrete information on marita 's whereabouts . now , art is imitating life on argentina 's airwaves . trimarco 's story has become the basis of one of argentina 's most popular nighttime soap operas , `` vidas robadas , '' or `` stolen lives . '' watch art imitate activism '' the program premiered in march on telefe , one of argentina 's largest television networks , to a lukewarm response . but as the storyline and characters evolved and word started to spread , the audience grew , and it became water-cooler television . `` stolen lives '' attracts more than 2 million viewers nightly , a considerable feat considering argentina 's population is only 40 million . the show 's plot centers on widowed anthropologist bautista amaya -lrb- played by facundo arana -rrb- and rosario soler -lrb- soledad silveyra -rrb- -- the mother of a young kidnapped girl , based on trimarco -- who team up to unravel an underground prostitution ring . `` with every performance , i try to display the inner feelings of this woman who is suffering , to transmit her grief , '' silveyra said . `` as an actress , i feel an enormous responsibility . '' the usual telenovela themes of love , passion and revenge are ever present in `` stolen lives , '' but the show strives to expose an issue that has remained in the dark in argentina until recently . human rights groups in argentina estimate that 800 women have gone missing at the hands of human traffickers since 2007 . worldwide , about 800,000 people are trafficked across borders annually , according to the u.s. state department . `` i am delighted that the show has been able to bring this topic to light , because no one ever talked about human trafficking in argentina before , '' trimarco said . `` stolen lives '' is the latest in a series of recent argentine telenovelas that dissect important social issues while also aiming to entertain . one of the most important was the 2006 hit `` montecristo , '' which examined crimes against humanity committed by argentina 's military during the 1970s and 1980s . local versions of `` montecristo '' are produced in nine countries around the globe , including turkey , portugal , mexico and russia . `` with these types of telenovelas , we are able to bring something entirely new to the public debate . and because we take a take a fictional and not a journalistic approach , we are able to attract and keep more viewers , '' telefe programming director claudio villarruel said . `` montecristo '' helped reunite children of argentina 's dirty war who `` disappeared '' with lost family members . the dirty war happened from 1976-83 , when the government carried out a secret campaign to purge the country of those it considered to be dissidents . `` stolen lives '' is making a similarly strong impact . trimarco established a foundation in her daughter 's honor , fundacion maria de los angeles , last year in tucuman . it counts u.s. ambassador to argentina earl wayne and argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner among its supporters . according to trimarco , the foundation has rescued 360 women and children from trafficking networks , and leads on missing people continue to pour in . argentina passed its first national law against human trafficking this year , a law that trimarco lobbied hard to get passed . meanwhile , praise rings from home and abroad . in may , `` stolen lives '' was declared a show of `` social interest '' by the buenos aires city legislature . in 2007 , trimarco received the u.s. state department 's `` international women of courage award '' from secretary of state condoleezza rice at a ceremony in washington . later this year , trimarco will travel to spain to speak about human trafficking with lawmakers from the european union . `` it 's just like condoleezza rice told me : my screams are being heard all over the world , '' she said . trimarco travels around argentina constantly , educating people about human trafficking , and following up on clues about marita . she is also raising marita 's daughter , micaela , 9 . with all the publicity surrounding the case and the success of `` stolen lives , '' trimarco has herself become a target . her accusations of political and police involvement have led to death threats , she says . still , she remains committed to the cause and says that collaborating with the producers of `` stolen lives '' to tell her story has helped give her the strength to continue searching for her daughter . `` i 'm content , because my pain is now serving a purpose , '' she said .
950	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- gov. david paterson of new york has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal , his spokeswoman said wednesday . the governor 's legal counsel told state agencies in a may 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in california and massachusetts as well as canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry , said erin duggan , the governor 's spokeswoman . the memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the new york 's human rights law , duggan said . the directive follows a february ruling from a new york state appeals court . that decision says that legal same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are entitled to recognition in new york . `` this was in direct response to a court ruling , '' duggan told cnn . `` just to make sure all the state agencies are on the same page . '' see what rules your state has about same-sex unions '' duggan says that the court 's decision was consistent with the findings of several lower courts in new york state . the governor 's legal counsel sent the memo one day before the california supreme court struck down a ban on gay marriage in that state . court officials in california counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on june 17 , state officials said wednesday . massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004 , and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. . however , then-gov . mitt romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners ' home state . subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of massachusetts , rhode island and new mexico may marry in massachusetts , unless the parties say they plan to move there after the marriage . new hampshire , vermont , new jersey and connecticut permit civil unions , while california has a domestic-partner registration law . more than a dozen other states give same-sex couples some legal rights , as do some other countries .
951	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- britain 's prince william is starting a two-month attachment with the royal navy on monday , part of the future king 's continued experience with various branches of the military , the ministry of defense said saturday . prince william and his father , prince charles , at his graduation from the royal air force in april . william , 25 , will spend the first part of his attachment on a basic sea safety course training in sea survival , firefighting and ship damage repair , according to the ministry . if william passes the course , as expected , he will join the hms iron duke in the caribbean , the department said . the ship 's function is to support overseas british territories in the event of a hurricane and to carry out counter-narcotic operations . the prince , who will be called sub lieutenant wales in the navy , is expected to spend time aboard a frigate , a mine hunter , a submarine and helicopters during his attachment , which ends august 1 , the ministry of defense said . william completed a four-month attachment with the royal air force this year and received his pilot 's wings upon graduating in april . he learned to fly three different aircraft during the attachment and is known as flying officer wales within the raf . william is also a second lieutenant in the british army , where he serves in the blues and royals regiment of the household cavalry . the attachments are designed to provide the prince with military experience for when he becomes head of the armed forces as king . `` when he becomes king , he needs to know his armed forces -- instinctively be very familiar with them -- and so he is doing this visit to the royal navy , '' said rear adm. bob cooling , the assistant chief of naval staff . william 's father , prince charles , had a five-year career in the navy in the 1970s . charles served on the guided missile destroyer hms norfolk and two frigates before qualifying as a helicopter pilot and joining a naval air squadron that operated from the aircraft carrier hms hermes . prince charles spent his last nine months in the navy in 1976 in command of the coastal minehunter hms bronington . william 's uncle prince andrew served 22 years in the royal navy as a helicopter pilot , seeing active service during the falklands war between britain and argentina in 1982 . queen elizabeth ii 's husband , prince philip , william 's grandfather , spent more than 13 years in the royal navy . he saw active service throughout world war ii and was in tokyo harbor when japan surrendered .

955	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former illinois gov. george ryan and a co-defendant lost another legal round at the supreme court on tuesday and will remain in prison on federal racketeering and fraud convictions . ex-gov . george ryan walks out of a chicago , illinois , courthouse after his april 2006 conviction . ryan and businessman larry warner claimed they did not receive a fair trial , but the justices , without comment , refused to intervene in the case . justice john paul stevens refused last fall to grant bail for the 74-year-old ryan , a move that would have kept him out of jail to file more appeals . the disgraced ex-governor reported to a federal prison in wisconsin in november to serve a 6 1/2 - year sentence . the men were convicted in april 2006 for fraud in a case stemming from bribes paid for various state licenses . their lawyers claimed the trial judge improperly removed two jurors while deliberations in the case had commenced , but a federal appeals court upheld the convictions . ryan , a republican , served as governor from 1999 to 2003 . he retired following investigations into political corruption in his administration . he also was noted for issuing a moratorium on capital punishment in his state in 2000 over concerns innocent inmates might be executed . the case decided tuesday is warner and ryan v. u.s. -lrb- 07-977 -rrb- .
956	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the crib in ellen darcy 's boston home has sat empty for more than a year . and in suburban washington , laura teresinski has prepared a nursery for a baby that may never arrive . guatemala has announced it will conduct a case-by-case review of every pending foreign adoption case . they and thousands of prospective parents , eager to adopt children from abroad , have found themselves in an emotional legal limbo since two of the most popular countries for international adoptions -- guatemala and vietnam -- recently halted their programs . now would-be mothers and fathers around the united states wonder what will become of their quest to adopt a child -- a pursuit that can fray nerves , cost up to $ 30,000 and span several years . guatemala announced this month that it would conduct a case-by-case review of every pending foreign adoption case . that put on hold the adoption plans of about 2,000 american families . the crackdown comes amid reports that some in guatemala coerce mothers to relinquish their children for adoption -- or steal the children outright and present them as orphans . similar accusations have arisen in vietnam . after the united states accused adoption agencies there of corruption and baby-selling , vietnam said in april that it would no longer allow adoptions to the united states . `` my husband and i were absolutely devastated , '' teresinski said . `` adoptive parents have put a lot of emotional energy and a lot of financial resources in the process . '' vietnam 's decision affects several hundred families . families in the united states adopted 4,728 children from guatemala and 828 from vietnam last year . the halt in adoptions from those two nations unfolds against the backdrop of a dramatic rise in international adoptions in the united states . the number of foreign-born children adopted by u.s. families more than tripled from 1990 to 2004 , when it reached a high of 22,884 , though the figure has declined slightly each year since . in 2007 , the u.s. granted visas to 19,613 children so they could join an adoptive family in the united states , according to u.s. state department figures . about 70 percent of those children came from four countries : china , guatemala , russia and ethiopia . a few other countries have also halted foreign adoptions at various times , including kazakhstan and togo . yet the suspensions in vietnam and guatemala have had the biggest impact -- they 're two of the 10 countries that send the most children to adoptive homes in the unites states . fear of fraud stirs heartache . for darcy , the review seems more detrimental than helpful . her adopted daughter , carolina , remains in a guatemalan foster home with three dozen other babies . darcy worries that keeping carolina , now 15 months old , in a foster home will harm her early development . `` she 's not getting one-on-one care by a consistent caretaker , '' darcy said , adding later , `` nobody is looking at this as a violation of the kids ' human rights except for these -lrb- american -rrb- parents . '' guatemala , which until now has had little to no oversight of its foreign adoptions , has the highest per capita rate of adoption in the world . nearly one in 100 babies born in guatemala wind up living with adoptive parents in the united states , according to the u.s. consulate in guatemala . while adoptive parents in the united states undergo rigorous screening , adoptions in guatemala had been processed by notaries responsible for determining whether the babies were relinquished voluntarily . they also arrange foster care and handle paperwork -- notaries in latin america tend to have more legal training than notaries in the united states . both guatemalan and u.s. officials fear the system leads to practices such as paying birth mothers for children or , in some instances , coercion . officials in both countries say gaps in regulations and the high sums of money at play -- adoptions can cost up to $ 30,000 -- may have created unintended incentives in a country where the state department estimates that 80 percent of the population lives in poverty . the guatemalan government has said its review could take a month or longer . as for the american families , they can only wait . `` i think it 's overkill , '' said darcy , who was matched with carolina last march and was approved to adopt the girl last winter -- typically one of the last steps before the actual adoption is complete . `` no adoptive parent wants to adopt an abducted child -- a child that was n't voluntarily relinquished -- but to keep them as hostages is unacceptable , '' darcy said . guatemala plans reforms . u.s. officials say they sympathize with the parents , but that reviews like the one in guatemala are in the best interest of the children . `` we feel for them , it 's a tough situation , '' said a state department official who is not authorized to speak on the record . '' -lrb- but -rrb- they 'll have the comfort of knowing american parents in the future who adopt from guatemala will get children from a system that has all the safeguards in place so that children are not exploited , '' the official said . in the past , guatemala required birth mothers to sign a document in court saying they were relinquishing their child . they were not required to reveal their reasons . now the government may require the presence of the birth mother and child . the goal is to verify identification and make sure the mother is giving up her child voluntarily . cleaning up guatemala 's adoption system is a step toward complying with the standards of the hague convention on intercountry adoption , an international agreement that governs adoptions from one country to another . about 70 nations have signed the convention , which seeks to ensure legitimate foreign adoptions . the united states joined the international convention last year , and rules governing adoptions from one signatory nation to another took effect april 1 . the united states has stopped issuing visas to guatemalan children after that date , blocking their travel to america -- at least until concerns are addressed . `` we 're not pointing fingers at american parents , '' the state department official said . however , the review and changes in guatemala will ensure that it `` does not become a fertile ground for -lrb- wrongful -rrb- practices on any person , particularly children , who have not been orphaned . '' to offset corruption , the u.s. embassy has added its own requirement : that birth mothers appear with the baby to request a visa for the baby . in august , officials also began requiring two dna tests to confirm the identities of mother and child . still , the guatemalan solicitor general 's office has identified at least 80 cases of adoption irregularities , including baby stealing and false dna tests . and the guatemalan chief prosecutor 's office recently launched a criminal investigation into the two laboratories contracted to take dna samples from birth mothers and children . ` serious irregularities ' in vietnam . similar concerns of corruption recently emerged in vietnam , where investigators had found `` serious adoption irregularities , '' according to a report by the u.s. embassy in hanoi . documents had been forged or altered , the embassy said , and some parents were paid , tricked or forced into giving up their children for adoption . in some cases , the embassy said , children were offered for adoption without the knowledge or permission of their parents . the vietnamese government has denied the accusations . even so , it said in april that it would terminate its adoption agreement with the united states , saying it wo n't accept applications after july 1 . the program is scheduled to end september 1 . parents in the united states who were matched with an adoptive child in vietnam before july 1 will be allowed to adopt that child . prospective parents who had invested time and money , but had not been matched with an adoptive child , appear to be out of luck . private adoption agencies insist that nearly all adoptions from vietnam are problem-free , and they want the adoptions to continue . `` it 's hard to let go , because we know we can advocate for these children and make a real difference , '' said linda brownlee , executive director of the nonprofit adoption center of washington , which places children for adoption from russia , china , cambodia and vietnam . she hopes the united states and vietnam reach an agreement so that adoptions can continue . `` without it , i think children are going to be harmed . they are going to die needlessly , and there is going to be trafficking , '' brownlee said .
957	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a navy admiral engaged in sexual relations in the white house in 1990 with a federal employee whom he falsely told he was a widower , according to a report released friday by the defense department . rear adm. john stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the navy staff . in march , when the report was submitted to pentagon officials , rear adm. john stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the navy staff . stufflebeem told investigators he could n't remember the name of the woman he had an affair with . he also lied when he told investigators he did not engage in sexual relations with the woman , identified as `` jane doe , '' the defense department 's inspector general 's report said . jane doe , who was then unmarried and working for a federal agency , told the investigators the allegations were true , the report said . her supervisor and stufflebeem 's superiors supported her testimony . stufflebeem was convicted april 18 of making false official statements to investigators . after the hearing , called an admiral 's mast , he requested retirement . jane doe told investigators that she and stufflebeem began their affair on an overseas trip in 1989 , that the married admiral told her he was a widower who was raising his children as a single parent and that they had sexual relations several times , including once in a white house room reserved for `` military aides with overnight duties . '' she also told investigators that stufflebeem came to her home on the day in august 1990 when she learned he was married and that she called him `` scum , '' shut the door in his face and never spoke to him again . read the report -lrb- pdf -rrb- . `` we found ms. doe to be an extremely credible , candid and articulate witness who willingly participated in our interview with the knowledge and support of her husband , '' the report said . by contrast , the report said , stufflebeem 's testimony was `` inconsistent with the weight of the evidence , '' and `` it did not appear stufflebeem 's misstatements in these areas of testimony were inadvertent . '' at issue was stufflebeem 's removal from his post as a presidential aide in 1990 . stufflebeem testified that he initiated the request to leave his white house post because of `` close family personal problems . '' but his superiors testified that he was removed from the post because of his relationship with the woman -- and that he admitted the affair . jane doe 's supervisor told investigators that when she learned of the affair from doe , she confirmed stufflebeem 's marital status and told doe what she 'd learned . `` ms. doe 's reaction , according to the supervisor , was one of complete surprise and shock , '' the report said . the supervisor also said that she telephoned stufflebeem 's immediate supervisor to tell him of the affair and that when she called a few weeks later to follow up , the supervisor told her that `` everybody in town knew boomer was f ` ing some bimbo at the -lsb- federal agency -rsb- . '' stufflebeem , however , denied to investigators that he had a sexual relationship with jane doe , although he admitted to one kiss and said he had an `` inappropriate relationship '' with her because he told her about his marital problems . `` i did not have sex with this woman , '' he said during one of two interviews with investigators . although he told investigators he could not remember the woman 's name , he testified that he `` had to live with shame for a long time '' after the `` inappropriate relationship '' ended , that he was `` racked with guilt '' and `` had a terrible time getting myself right with my family . '' `` so i have had a great 18-year career since i left the white house , '' he said , according to the report . `` if this is the end of it , then i still leave a rewarded individual , thankful for the blessings that i have had . '' investigators found stufflebeem 's remarks inconsistent . `` in our view , comments regarding guilt , shame , and the end of a distinguished naval career are incongruous with a physical relationship limited to one kiss , '' they wrote in the report . this year , according to the report , the inspector general 's office provided stufflebeem with its preliminary findings : that he 'd provided `` false and misleading testimony '' regarding the nature of his relationship with jane doe , his inability to recall her name and his representation to her of himself as a widower . stufflebeem responded with a vehement denial . '' -lsb- i -rsb- find it extremely regrettable , in a case that has such far reaching implications for my career , that you have chosen to question my integrity , '' he wrote in a february 15 letter . `` the unfortunate truth in this case is that , as a result of lack of evidence to substantiate the allegation of a sexual relationship and in lieu of investigating the underlying allegations , you have chosen to accuse me of being untruthful as i defended myself against these allegations . '' stufflebeem further castigated the investigators because , at that time , they had chosen not to interview jane doe `` in deference to ms. doe 's privacy , '' according to the report . doe `` readily agreed '' to testify when they contacted her after stufflebeem 's rebuttal . `` ms. doe confirmed that she and stufflebeem had an extensive physical relationship which began on an overseas trip and lasted intermittently for approximately eight months , '' the investigators wrote . `` the relationship included sexual intercourse on approximately one dozen occasions , to include intercourse during overseas travel , in the white house and in her home .

958	jakarta , indonesia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- indonesia will withdraw from the organization of petroleum exporting countries at the end of the year , the country 's energy minister told foreign journalists wednesday . indonesia has become a net importer of oil due to declining production levels . purnomo yusgiantoro said the move follows declining oil production levels in indonesia that have left the country a net importer of oil . `` in the future , if our production -lrb- comes -rrb- back again to the level that gives us a status as a net oil exporter , then i think we can go back to opec again , '' he said . `` but today we decided that we are pulling out of opec . '' it was not immediately clear what effect indonesia 's decision will have on global oil prices . however the move was not unexpected . indonesia , which joined opec in 1962 , is the only southeast asian country in the 13-nation oil cartel . oil production there has steadily decreased in the last decade because of disappointing exploration efforts and declining production , according to the u.s. energy information administration . since 1996 , total production has dropped by 32 percent . the country 's current output quota for crude oil as set by opec is 1.45 million barrels a day -- well above its production capacity . in 2006 , indonesia imported more oil than it exported . cnn 's kathy quiano contributed to this report .
959	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- authorities have re-arrested three men in connection with the disappearance of an alabama teenager in aruba in 2005 , based on new evidence in the case , prosecutors announced wednesday . natalee holloway disappeared while on an aruba vacation in 2005 . brothers deepak and satish kalpoe were arrested in aruba at the same time authorities in the netherlands picked up joran van der sloot at the request of the aruban government , the statement said . van der sloot is attending school in holland . the three had previously been arrested in 2005 , aruban prosecutors noted in a statement , but a court released them , citing insufficient evidence . they are now charged with `` involvement in the voluntary manslaughter of natalee holloway or causing serious bodily harm to natalee holloway , resulting in her death , '' the statement said . watch interview with holloway 's father '' van der sloot , now 20 , and the kalpoes , now ages 24 and 21 , were the last people seen with holloway , 18 , as she left carlos n ' charlie 's nightclub in oranjestad , aruba , about 1:30 a.m. on may 30 , 2005 . all three men have maintained their innocence in her disappearance . view a timeline of the case '' no information was immediately available about what the new evidence was that led to the arrests . aruban prosecutors said a team of detectives from the netherlands has been reviewing the holloway case at the request of authorities in aruba , and had been on the island as late as last month to complete the investigation . the kalpoe brothers were being interrogated by aruban police wednesday , aruba prosecutor dop kruimel told cnn . they will appear before a judge friday for a preliminary arrest hearing , in which the judge determines whether the arrest was credible , she said . the judge can then authorize their being detained for eight more days , meaning police have that much time to produce evidence . the suspects then go before a judge again , she said . van der sloot was arrested in arnhem , the netherlands , by dutch police , kruimel said . aruban authorities have asked for him to be extradited to aruba within eight days . because they were not familiar with the case , dutch police were not questioning van der sloot , she said . he will be questioned when he is brought back to aruba , she said . however , he will appear before a judge thursday in arnhem . when cnn called the kalpoe household , the person who answered the phone hung up . earlier , van der sloot 's mother , anita van der sloot , told cnn her son had not been arrested , but had only reported to a police station in the netherlands for questioning wednesday after receiving a letter asking him to do so . anita van der sloot said she had spoken to her son briefly from her home in aruba . she said a dutch attorney was with him , and she expected him to appear before a judge and be released thursday . meanwhile , a spokeswoman for holloway 's mother , beth holloway , said in a statement , `` the family is always hopeful when a step in the right direction is made in the case . '' beth holloway was refusing interviews for now , said spokeswoman sunny tillman . she previously was known as beth holloway-twitty , but has returned to using holloway after a divorce earlier this year . natalee holloway was visiting aruba with a group of about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from mountain brook high school in suburban birmingham , alabama , when she went to carlos n ' charlie 's that night in 2005 . the group had planned to leave for home the following day , and holloway 's packed bags and passport were found in her hotel room after she failed to show up for her flight . her disappearance triggered an exhaustive search and investigation and a media sensation in the united states , aruba , the netherlands and beyond , but holloway has never been found . aruban authorities have been criticized for their handling of the case . at least 10 men , including van der sloot and the kalpoes , have been arrested and identified as suspects either in holloway 's disappearance or in an alleged cover-up . all were questioned and released . legal experts , however , have said differences in the u.s. and aruban systems should be taken into account . aruba 's criminal justice system is based on dutch law and a descendant of the napoleonic code . in aruba , authorities ' reasonable suspicion that someone knows about or is involved in a crime is enough to make an arrest , while magistrates investigate and judges determine a suspect 's guilt or innocence . there are no jury trials . aruban authorities , meanwhile , have suggested that holloway may have overdosed on drugs or died of alcohol poisoning . beth holloway and natalee holloway 's father , dave holloway , filed a lawsuit last year against van der sloot and his father , aruban judge paulus van der sloot , in the supreme court of the state of new york . the van der sloots were served with the suit while on a trip to new york . however , a judge in august 2006 dismissed the suit , saying new york was an inconvenient forum in which to consider it . it was unclear whether holloway 's parents have pursued legal action elsewhere . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's kimberly segal and eric marrapodi contributed to this report .
960	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- two u.s. customs agents were arrested on charges they helped smuggle drugs and other contraband through new york 's john f. kennedy international airport . the dea says two customs officials at jfk international airport helped smuggle drugs and contraband . customs supervisor walter golembiowski and officer john ajello face narcotics , bribery and conspiracy charges in the case , according to the u.s. drug enforcement administration . golembiowski and ajello regularly solicited and accepted bribes to allow contraband to pass through undetected , the dea said . two airport workers and two others were also charged with importing counterfeit goods . some of those items included rolex , cartier and chanel watches and designer sunglasses , the dea said . on several occasions , golembiowski was captured on audio and video taking bribes to aid his co-conspirators in bringing in illegal drugs and counterfeit goods . `` smuggling any kind of illegal commodity raises troubling issues at a time of deep concern over national security , '' said michael j. garcia , the u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york . `` the threat is heightened when a government official accepts bribes to help smugglers breach our borders . '' the arrests came as a result of a lengthy sting operation by a state , local and federal task force . prosecutors said numerous recorded meetings and phone calls captured the suspects talking about plans to smuggle hashish , ecstasy and other illegal items . the investigation has led to the indictment and prosecution of more than 20 people -- `` from distributors to overseas sources of supply '' -- and the seizure of more than 600 pounds of imported hashish and other drugs from the united states and france , according to the statement .
961	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- more than 100 countries attending a conference in dublin , ireland formally adopted a treaty friday to ban cluster bombs -- a large , unreliable and inaccurate weapon that often affects civilians long after the end of armed conflict . cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers . a document released by ireland 's department of foreign affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain . the countries also agreed never to develop , acquire , retain or transfer cluster munitions . countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty wednesday but formally signed it friday . the accord calls for a total , immediate ban of the weapons , strong standards to protect those injured by them , contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed , he said . thomas nash , coordinator of the cmc campaigning organization , said wednesday : `` this is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons . '' though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs , including the united states , russia , china and israel , were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord , organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance . `` take the united states , '' nash said . `` almost all of its allies are here . they 've decided to ban these weapons . that 's going to make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for the united states to ever use these weapons again , either on its own or in joint operations . '' the agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years , he said . cluster munitions , which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets , are what the international committee of the red cross calls a `` persistent humanitarian problem . '' most of a cluster bomb 's bomblets are meant to explode on impact , but many do not . estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time , the red cross says . that means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area , often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians . last week , acting assistant secretary for political-military affairs stephen d. mull called it `` an absolute moral obligation '' to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle . but he also predicted that the united states would not agree to any ban . `` we think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions ... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use , '' mull said . `` the united states relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy . '' instead , he urged that the weapons be regulated `` to take humanitarian considerations into account '' and that `` technological fixes '' be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle . during the 34-day war in lebanon in 2006 , the united nations estimated that israel dropped 4 million bomblets , 1 million of which may not have exploded , according to the international committee of the red cross . more than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern lebanon since the war ended . cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in kosovo . lt. col. jim burke , a military adviser to the irish defense forces said they quickly became a major killer of civilians . in more than 20 countries , according to the icrc , cluster bombs have created lasting `` no-go '' areas , rendering them as dangerous as minefields . laos is the most affected country . millions of bomblets dropped during the vietnam war continue to kill civilians more than three decades later . still , militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area , such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape . a single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles . cnn 's jacqueline clyne contributed to this report .
962	lagos , nigeria -lrb- ap -rrb- -- a rebel group that has been attacking oil pipelines in southern nigeria claimed responsibility on monday for another strike and said it killed 11 government soldiers in fighting that followed the sabotage . a fire burns following an attack on a pipeline in nigeria in december 2006 . the nigerian military confirmed an attack on an oil pipeline and an explosion , but called the claim that 11 soldiers were killed a `` lie '' and `` pure propaganda . '' the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta , or mend , issued a statement saying it `` successfully sabotaged another major trunk pipeline '' belonging to the shell petroleum development company in the country 's rivers state . `` minutes after the sabotage , our fighters encountered a military gunboat which opened fire blindly on the advance guard . we flanked them in a counter-attack and killed in close combat all the drunken soldiers numbering eleven , collecting their weapons , ammunitions and bullet-proof vests before using dynamite to sink the gunboat with its dead occupants , '' mend said . mend also said they found two `` traumatized , adolescent girls '' who were gang-raped by nigerian soldiers . `` they were dropped off in the neighboring village by our men who have since returned safely to camp , '' the statement said . the military had no immediate response to that claim . analysts say that one reason for record high gas prices in the united states is a spate of attacks on oil pipelines in nigeria , the fourth largest supplier of oil to the united states . exxon and shell are two of several companies that had been extracting two million barrels of oil a day in nigeria . yet rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the niger delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days . the rebel group hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the niger delta , where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day . mend has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers , typically releasing them unharmed , sometimes after receiving a ransom payment . the nigerian government has proposed a peace summit to find a solution to the region 's problems , but an immediate resolution does not appear in sight .

'' `` although hillary clinton has offered solid and sensible policy proposals , obama 's strike me as even more so , '' reich wrote on his blog . he served as the secretary of labor from 1993-1997 and is currently a professor at brandeis university . `` his plans for reforming social security and health care have a better chance of succeeding , '' reich continued . `` his approaches to the housing crisis and the failures of our financial markets are sounder than hers ... he has put forward the more enlightened foreign policy and the more thoughtful plan for controlling global warming . '' reich , whose relationship with the clintons dates back to their law school days at yale , has long been a critic of the new york senator 's white house bid . shortly before the iowa caucuses in january , he wrote that voters would have a choice `` between someone who talks the talk , and somebody who 's walked the walk . '' `` i do n't get it , '' he wrote then . `` if there 's anyone in the race whose history shows unique courage and character , it 's barack obama . hrc 's -lsb- hillary rodham clinton 's -rsb- campaign , by contrast , is singularly lacking in conviction about anything . '' reich also criticized bill clinton earlier in the year over the former president 's sharp attacks on obama in south carolina . `` bill clinton 's ill-tempered and ill-founded attacks on barack obama are doing no credit to the former president , his legacy , or his wife 's campaign , '' he wrote in january . `` nor are they helping the democratic party . '' asked to respond to reich 's endorsement , clinton spokesman mo eleithee said , `` did n't he endorse him last year ? '' reich is the latest former clinton administration official to announce his support for obama . last month , new mexico gov. bill richardson , who held several positions under bill clinton , also came out in support of the illinois senator . clinton supporter and cnn political analyst james carville later called that an `` act of betrayal . '' meanwhile , the obama campaign announced that former sens. sam nunn of georgia and david boren of oklahoma endorsed the illinois senator , and agreed to serve on the campaign 's national security policy team . nunn served 25 years in the senate and was chairman of the senate armed services committee from 1987 to 1995 . he said obama is `` our best choice to lead the nation . '' `` i believe that he will bring to the white house , high principles , clear vision and sound judgment , '' he added . boren -- who served in the senate from 1979 to 1994 and is the longest-serving chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence -- was one of bill clinton 's top choices to replace les aspes in 1994 as u.s. secretary of defense . he said obama is a person of `` sound and good judgement .

'' and sen. mitch mcconnell , r-kentucky , said he believes `` that the current stem cell policy has been very important in driving the discovery of ethical and successful ways for scientists to find treatments and cures . `` what has too often been missing from this important debate is a simple fact of modern science : encouraging medical research and protecting the sanctity of life are not mutually exclusive goals . '' the methods described in the papers about the new research `` should continue to be pursued and strongly promoted , as they should help to steer the entire field of stem cell research in a more explicitly ethical direction by circumventing the moral quagmire associated with destroying human embryos , '' said the national catholic bioethics center in philadelphia , pennsylvania , in a posting on its web site . but those views were not shared by sen. tom harkin , d-iowa , who has pushed for federal funding of embryonic stem cell research and said he will continue to do so . `` our top researchers recognize that this new development does not mean that we should discontinue studying embryonic stem cells , '' he said in a written statement . `` scientists may yet find that embryonic stem cells are more powerful . we need to continue to pursue all alternatives as we search for treatments for diabetes , parkinson 's and spinal cord injuries . '' he added that tuesday 's announcement `` reiterates the need for federal support for medical research and again points out the president 's misplaced priorities in vetoing the labor , health and human services , and education appropriations bill which included a substantial increase for the national institutes of health . '' a lead author of one of the landmark studies , james thomson of the university of wisconsin-madison , urged that reprogrammed cells not wholly supplant embryonic stem cells in research . `` i do n't like the idea of pulling the plug , '' he told reporters in a conference call . he added that tuesday 's advances in reprogramming cells would not have been possible without the advancements in embryonic stem cell research over the past decade . e-mail to a friend .

'' -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- can we all just stop the silly nonsense over who is an elitist and whether an `` average american '' will occupy the white house ? listening to the punditry today , you would think folks who revel in the comedy of larry the cable guy or katt williams really would have a shot at the white house . it 's totally absurd . so , sen. barack obama is all of a sudden an elitist because he went to columbia and harvard ? and sen. hillary clinton is an elitist because she went to yale ? do you actually think sen. john mccain is n't an elitist ? he went to an exclusive college -- the naval academy , and that is one of the hardest places to get into . -lrb- you ca n't even apply unless a member of congress recommends you . -rrb- . karl rove , who tries to portray himself as the common man but is just another rich republican , has called both democratic candidates elitists . well , his former boss , president george w. bush , went to yale . so did bush 's dad , former president george h.w. bush , and his granddaddy , former sen. prescott bush . all three bushes also were members of the super elite organization skull and bones . the younger bush later went to harvard . he walked into the governor 's mansion and the presidency on the strength of his name and his dad 's money and connections . sounds like an elitist to me ! but no , we 're supposed to be fooled by the cowboy boots , folksy charm and him removing brush at his crawford , texas , ranch -lrb- do n't forget the family compound in kennebunkport , maine , where all the `` regular '' folks hang out -rrb- . surely you recall when bush nominated harriet miers for the supreme court ? those same conservative voices decrying the elitist democrats were blasting her because she went to little old southern methodist university , that unremarkable -- their view -- university in dallas , texas . -lrb- by the way , that will be the home of the george w. bush library . -rrb- . you can bet a pitcher of beer that had she graduated from harvard , yale or princeton , she would n't have been derisively referred to as too plain and not educated enough by the elitists in the republican party . and let 's stay with the supreme court for a moment . where did its members go to school ? chief justice john g. roberts jr. -- undergrad and law school , harvard . justice john paul stevens -- undergrad : university of chicago . law school : northwestern . justice antonin scalia -- undergrad : georgetown university and the university of fribourg , switzerland . law school : harvard . justice anthony kennedy -- undergrad : stanford university and the london school of economics . law school : harvard . justice david souter -- undergrad : harvard ; magdalen college , oxford ; oxford university . law school : harvard . justice clarence thomas -- undergrad : holy cross . law school : yale . justice ruth ginsburg -- undergrad : cornell . law school : harvard -lrb- attended -rrb- ; finished at columbia . justice stephen breyer -- undergrad , stanford ; magdalen college , oxford . law school : harvard . justice samuel alito -- undegrad : princeton . law school : yale . that 's pretty much an elite list of schools . we have deluded ourselves into thinking the person elected to the white house is really and truly like the rest of us . all three candidates do n't know what it 's like to face the daunting health care challenges millions of americans are confronted with daily . each are members of the u.s. senate , and they have the best health care money can buy for life -- we pay for it ! while your pension plan is shot to hell , their plan will never be underfunded . the members will see to that , courtesy of taxpayer dollars . forget how many times obama bowls gutter balls , clinton tosses back shots of whiskey and mccain talks about how he 's a regular guy . each , courtesy of their $ 169,300 annual salary , makes far more than the average american . and when it comes to wealth , clinton gets to enjoy the $ 100 million she and her husband raked in since he left the white house -lrb- even their hefty book advances dwarf regular authors -rrb- . mccain 's wife , cindy , runs one of anheuser busch 's largest beer distributors and is worth more than $ 100 million . they will never be living paycheck-to-paycheck . obama is the poorest of the three , but he did earn more than a million bucks courtesy of his best-selling books , `` the audacity of hope '' and `` dreams from my father '' after delivering his 2004 keynote speech at the democratic national convention . how many average americans would n't mind having a million dollars in their savings account ? bottom line : the narrative about our presidential candidates being just regular folks is a tired myth that gets repeated each and every day . and their efforts to show that they are `` just like us '' are really pathetic . you do n't have to go duck hunting , be seen buying milk at the grocery store for your family or having a beer at the local bar to show that you 're `` one of us . '' just do what rich and highly educated folks do when they are in politics : advance policies that will at least allow me to keep a few more dollars in my pocket and be able to afford a home . one more thing : do n't buy fully into the nonsense tossed out by some of the loudest voices on television , radio and in print who decry these `` elitists '' and trumpet that they are for the blue collar , middle-class worker in middle america . many of them pull down multimillion-dollar salaries and run into these same candidates on martha 's vineyard and in the hamptons when they all vacation . they , too , will pull every favor they have to get their children in the posh private schools and ivy league institutions . yes , we even have elitists in the media . who would 've thunkit ? e-mail to a friend .
969	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- children from a polygamist sect who one mother says are `` hurting very badly '' in state custody are likely to be returned to their parents , a cnn legal analyst says . flds member margaret jessop says her children `` feel betrayed by adults . '' a texas appeals court ruled thursday that the state had no right to remove hundreds of children from the fundamentalist church of latter-day saints ' ranch in eldorado on april 3 , based on the suspicion that a few were being sexually abused . a sect mother who has four children in state custody said the matter has not been fully resolved because an appeal to the texas supreme court is possible . `` i 'm very grateful , but i 'd like to see the children in my arms before i rejoice greatly , '' margaret jessop said on cnn 's `` larry king live . '' watch jessop react to the ruling '' but a permanent reunion of families is likely , said jeffrey toobin , cnn senior legal analyst . `` based on this ruling i think it 's clear that if it stands , all these kids are going back with their mothers , '' toobin said on cnn 's `` anderson cooper 360 ° . '' jessop and other flds parents said they had been permitted visits with their children in foster care . zavenda young said two of her children were sent to waco , texas , and two to hockley , 148 miles away . `` they 're in boys and girls country in hockley . and it 's just a -- it 's an institution , '' she told host larry king . their father , edson jessop , said the experience has been rough on the children . `` you can see it 's a lot of stress on them , '' he said . `` every time we leave , they go through that trauma again . it 's enough to rip your heart out .

'' a statement from the agency thursday said it 's working out a response to the court ruling . `` child protective services has one duty -- to protect children , '' the statement said . `` when we see evidence that children have been sexually abused and remain at risk of further abuse , we will act . ... we will work with the office of the attorney general to determine the state 's next step in this case .

970	beirut , lebanon -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the fiery leader of lebanon 's hezbollah militant movement assured lebanon on monday that his movement will cooperate in the country 's political life . supporters carry posters of hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah . hassan nasrallah said : `` we do n't want to have control over lebanon , or to have governance over lebanon or to impose our ideas over the people of lebanon , because we believe lebanon to be a special and diverse country that needs the collaboration of everyone . '' nasrallah spoke a day after lebanon 's parliament elected michel sleiman the country 's president after a six-month vacancy in the position . nasrallah , speaking at a packed stadium , told his followers : `` i renew my appeal and invitation for a true national partnership with no eliminations or impositions . the national unity government is not the victory of the opposition against the pro-government . it is the victory of all lebanese . '' he said sleiman 's election `` renews the hope amongst the lebanese people to a new era and a new start . '' `` i must say that there are deep wounds from our side and theirs , we are both in front of two choices ; either to expand the wounds and add salt to them or try to cure them for the sake of lebanon and we prefer the second choice . '' the parliament had tried 19 times to vote on a new president , but failed because of disagreements over how to share power in a new cabinet . lebanon 's western-backed government and the hezbollah-led opposition reached a deal last week aimed at ending an 18-month political crisis that pushed the country to the brink of civil war , and paved the way for sleiman 's election . the agreement , reached in doha , qatar , calls for a consensus government in which the cabinet would be comprised of 30 posts -- 16 for the majority , 11 for the hezbollah-led opposition and three set aside for the president to nominate . the seat allocation had been a key sticking point for the opposition , which wanted to ensure it had the power to veto major decisions . with 11 cabinet posts , it will have that power . in exchange for the veto power and a redistricting plan ahead of next year 's elections , hezbollah agreed to end its sit-in protest that has paralyzed downtown beirut since late 2006 . in his speech , sleiman expressed gratitude to qatar and to the arab league for helping broker the deal . sleiman was the consensus candidate , and is viewed as a neutral party by lebanon 's political factions . the nation 's previous presidents have been seen as either pro-syrian or pro-western . in his 10 years as chief of the army , sleiman also is believed to have unified the splintered military . however , he inherits a nation grappling with divisions . lebanon 's elected , pro-western government has long been locked in a power struggle with hezbollah . in public statements and demonstrations in recent years , hezbollah threatened to use its power and popularity to oust the sunni-led government , triggering fears of a new civil war that could further destabilize the volatile region . the election helped end a political crisis that deteriorated into violence this month . that crisis was defused when the lebanese government gave in to two key hezbollah demands -- lifting a government ban of hezbollah 's telecommunications system and reinstating the chief of security at beirut 's airport . `` the performance of the opposition proved that it did not organize a coup , but only wanted the illegal government to withdraw its two decisions , '' nasrallah said . `` i promise that the opposition 's representation in the government will not be monopolized by hezbollah , amal and the change and reform bloc . we will give other opposition parties shares - and unfortunately we must speak of shares - even if it is at the expense of hezbollah 's shares . '' hezbollah has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks against u.s. , israeli , and other western targets and the united states lists it as a terrorist organization . but many in lebanon and other parts of the middle east -- particularly shiites -- view hezbollah militants as freedom fighters .

972	-lrb- aol autos -rrb- -- there is an old adage which goes something like this : `` the cheap man always pays more in the long run . '' consumer reports analyzed the cost of ownership across the 300 models in their database . consumer reports magazine recently reached a similar conclusion when it announced the results of a study that compared the cost of ownership of more than 300 cars . consumer reports noted that a car with a cheaper sticker price can often cost consumers more in the long run when compared to a higher-priced alternative . the report , which appeared in consumer reports ' annual april auto issue , was based on a comparison of the 300 models in the consumer reports database . in short , the report concluded that a car 's sticker price is one of many factors that should be taken into account when trying to decide between two cars in the same class . for example , at about $ 17,500 , a mitsubishi lancer is priced $ 5,000 less than a mini cooper . but when factoring in the total costs of ownership for each vehicle , the lancer could cost drivers about $ 3,000 more to own over the first five years , according to the study . and the purchase price of a toyota highlander is about $ 3,000 more than a v6 ford explorer -- but the explorer 's total cost of ownership is an extra $ 6,500 over those five years . the study took into account such factors as depreciation , fuel costs , interest paid on the car loan , insurance , maintenance , repair costs and sales tax . online subscribers to www.consumerreports.org can compare the costs for one , three , five and eight years of ownership . `` we think this information is valuable for consumers who have shopped around , and settled on a couple of different cars they like , and then have to decide on one or the other , '' noted cliff weathers , consumer reports ' deputy editor , autos . `` we 're giving this information to the consumer to use as a tool to help them make that decision , a tie-breaker , if you will . `` if they 're trying to decide between a pontiac solstice and mazda miata , for example , they can go to our web site and find out which one will cost less to own over that five-year period . and in this particular case , the answer would be the miata -- which was one of the least expensive cars to own of all the cars evaluated in our survey . '' depreciation was factored into the estimates based on the assumption that the vehicle will eventually be traded in when buyers make their next car purchase . `` depreciation is the factor that accounts for the highest cost of ownership , '' weathers explained . `` depreciation accounts for 48 percent of the cost of ownership over the first five years . '' different models depreciate faster , and more significantly , than others . in order to calculate depreciation for this owner-cost comparison , consumer reports started with the price that a typically-equipped model generally sells for . if a particular model often sells at a largely-discounted price that was also factored in . consumer reports then deducted the wholesale trade-in value of the car at the end of the period , based on data from their used car price service , weathers explained . in those cases when consumer reports did n't have depreciation data for a new model , it used estimates based on comparable vehicles . the fuel factor . the second-biggest factor in cost-of-ownership , after depreciation , is fuel costs , which account for 21 percent of the total ownership costs . `` fuel economy can really make a big difference , '' weathers said . `` if you have a car that gets 25 miles per gallon , and another car that gets 19 miles per gallon , that 's a potential difference of thousands of dollars over five years , if you 're driving 12,000 miles a year . '' consumer reports calculated fuel costs by assuming that the vehicles would be driven 12,000 miles a year -- the average annual mileage reported by those who responded to consumer reports ' annual reader survey . consumer reports then applied the national average price of regular gas as of december 2007 or , if applicable , the price of premium or diesel fuel . fuel costs were an especially big factor with suvs , the comparison revealed . drivers who buy a dodge nitro could pay more than $ 10,000 to fill up the tank over a five-year period , for example . but the fuel costs for a similar-sized , more fuel-efficient toyota rav4 v6 would be $ 2,000 less during that period . consumer reports ' comparison also concluded that interest paid on car loans accounts for about 12 percent of five-year ownership costs . that figure is based on a five-year loan , with a 15 percent down payment , using the average interest rate of 6.86 percent reported by bankrate.com in december 2007 . auto insurance accounts for about 11 percent of total ownership costs over five years , according to the consumer reports comparison . car insurance costs can vary depending on several factors such as the driver 's age , location , and driving record . auto insurance costs , in some cases , dramatically boosted the ownership costs of models that otherwise boasted reasonable ownership costs . as an example , weathers compared the difference in auto insurance rates for mitsubishi lancer evolution and a similarly-priced acura tl . `` insurance for the lancer can cost you $ 2,500 a year or more , based our 2007 figures , '' notes weathers . `` meanwhile , the annual car insurance rates for the acura tl can cost as little as $ 900 . '' maintenance & repairs . surprisingly , maintenance and car repairs account for only four percent of the cost of ownership , weathers said . the maintenance and repair cost figures used in consumer reports ' cost of ownership comparison were based on information gleaned from more than a million respondents in its annual car reliability survey . one notable conclusion reached in the consumer reports study is that lexus models have relatively high maintenance and repair costs -- primarily due to maintenance alone , even though lexus owners reported excellent reliability . the lexus es350 racks up an average of $ 2,300 in maintenance and repair in the first five years . meanwhile , owners of a comparable lincoln mkz can expect to pay only half that much . another interesting tidbit discovered in the comparison is that the range rover is the most expensive vehicle on average for five and eight years when it comes to maintenance and repairs , costing about $ 2,000 in the fifth year alone . meanwhile , the comparable toyota land cruiser costs only $ 600 in that year to maintain and repair . some might be surprised to hear that the sales tax on the purchase price of the vehicle accounts for as much of the cost of ownership as maintenance and repairs . for its study , consumer reports used the national average of 4.83 percent in 2007 . with hybrid cars being a hot topic in the auto industry , consumer reports was also interested in the cost of owning one of those fuel-sipping vehicles . the report concluded that toyota prius hybrid actually costs less to own than similar conventional models . specifically , the sale price of a prius is about $ 7,500 higher than a similarly-sized chevrolet cobalt , but the total cost of ownership over five years is almost $ 2,000 less - due primarily to its much lower fuel costs , although the amount of depreciation was a factor as well . weathers pointed to another interesting finding : `` there are some vehicles , namely bmw , that are very inexpensive to own over first five years , because all of the maintenance is paid for during that period , under the warranty , '' he says . `` but if we take it forward , the cost of maintenance and repairs over the next three years after that is going to be more expensive .

975	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- human rights and freedom of the press in china , the detention of terrorist suspects by the united states and russia 's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in amnesty international 's annual report , released wednesday , which looks at the state of human rights around the world . amnesty international protestors outside the us supreme court in january dressed as guantanamo bay detainees . the 398-page report comes 60 years after the united nations adopted the universal declaration of human rights , and amnesty says governments still need to act on their promises . `` the biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership , '' the organization said in a statement . irene khan , amnesty 's secretary-general , said that in particular , `` the human-rights flash points in darfur , zimbabwe , gaza , iraq and myanmar demand immediate attention . '' the report , the group said , `` reveals a world riven by inequality , scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression . '' according to its count , people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries , face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries . of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report , amnesty paid particular attention to china , the host of this summer 's olympic games . the group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in china in 2007 , with ethnic and religious minorities -- including tibetans , falun gong practitioners and christians -- repressed or persecuted . death penalty statistics in china are difficult to assess , amnesty said , but based on public reports , the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007 . amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in china and said censorship of the internet and other media intensified last year . `` the chinese authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information , '' the report said . `` they decided what topics and news stories could be published , and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives . the authorities continued to block web sites and to filter internet content based on specified words and topics . '' around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online , amnesty said . amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the united states , where 42 people were executed last year . it noted new jersey 's decision in december to abolish the death penalty made it the first u.s. state in more than 40 years to do away with executions . as it has in previous annual reports , amnesty criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba . `` the usa must close guantanamo detention camp and secret detention centers , prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them , and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment , '' amnesty said . the group noted that guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely , most of them without charge and without recourse to u.s. courts . most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum-security facilities , heightening concerns for their physical and mental health , amnesty said . in fact , more is written on the united states than any other country listed in the report . asked about that at a press conference tuesday , khan said , `` we certainly devote a lot of time to sudan , to china , to zimbabwe and other countries . but we look to the u.s. to provide leadership around the world . governments around the world look to the united states as a role model for their own behavior . '' in a lengthy section on iraq , amnesty noted that thousands of civilians , including children , were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007 . `` all sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations , some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity , '' the report said . abductions , torture and murder , with bodies left in the street , occur daily , and the violence has caused 2 million iraqis to flee to syria , jordan and elsewhere , amnesty said . u.s. forces held some 25,000 detainees `` without charge or trial , '' the group said , and 33 people were executed , `` some after grossly unfair trials . '' in afghanistan , conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to `` large-scale displacement '' of people throughout the year . `` at least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict , '' the report said . `` violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups . '' russia must show greater tolerance for political dissent , amnesty said . `` the russian authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism , branding it ` unpatriotic , ' '' the report said . `` a crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run-up to the state duma -lsb- parliament -rsb- elections in december . '' the european court of human rights ruled that russia was responsible for enforced disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in chechnya , amnesty said . there were fewer reported disappearances in the chechen republic in 2007 than in previous years , amnesty said , but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses . the report also criticized human rights conditions in iran , gaza and myanmar . human rights conditions in zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007 , the report said , `` with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association , assembly and expression .

982	middlesbrough , england -- middlesbrough have confirmed that midfielders fabio rochemback and gaizka mendieta and striker dong gook lee have all been released . middlesbrough have decided against taking up the option of re-signing brazilian midfielder fabio rochemback . the premier league club had an option to extend brazilian rochemback 's deal by another two years , but manager gareth southgate has decided to let him go . `` we both feel that the time is right for fabio to have a fresh challenge , '' southgate said . `` he is a talented footballer and i think he 's just had his best season for us , while it was fitting that he should bow out against manchester city on sunday with probably his best performance in a middlesbrough shirt . '' the 26-year-old joined boro from barcelona in 2005 and played 91 games for the teesside club . he signed off in style by scoring a thumping long-range free-kick in sunday 's 8-1 victory over city . rochemback , who netted seven times for boro , played a major role in helping the club reach the 2006 uefa cup final , a year after appearing in the final during a loan spell with sporting lisbon -- where he is expected to move back to this summer . mendieta , 34 , was one of football 's costliest players when he joined lazio from valencia for 48 million euros in 2001 , but he disappointed and joined barcelona and then boro on loan . the former spain midfielder joined permanently on a free transfer in 2004 , but has not played for the first team since december 26 , 2006 . `` it was a difficult situation for a player of gaizka 's caliber to find himself out of the first team reckoning , '' added southgate . `` i made it clear to him that he did not figure in my plans but he decided to stay and try to get back into the first team . `` that did n't work out but his attitude to training was always excellent and he was a good influence on some of our young reserve team players . '' south korean international lee joined boro on a free transfer from pohang steelers in january 2007 . he scored only twice in 11 starts and 18 appearances as a substitute and has not appeared for the first team since early february . southgate is still hopeful of persuading goalkeeper mark schwarzer to sign a new contract at the riverside . the 35-year-old australian joined boro from bradford city in a $ 3 million deal in february 1997 and has played nearly 450 games for the club . his deal runs out this summer and he has so far refused to sign an extension , prompting reports of interest from a host of european clubs . `` we are talking to mark . i 'd like him to stay . his experience is important but he has real drive and determination that is still increasing , '' said southgate . `` he is the one in our dressing room that can truly say he has played at the highest level -- in world cups , in europe , in cup finals and so on . `` we have to negotiate and see where we go , but players have to want to stay here and we have to want to keep them . `` mark has been here a long time so he has to decide if he needs a fresh challenge , whether what we are trying to do is going to excite him , whether he feels he is going to be appreciated here . '' southgate also confirmed they have offered striker tom craddock and right-back tony mcmahon one-year extensions to their current deals , which run out this summer . brazilian rivaldo has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for greek club aek again next season . the 36-year-old had decided to quit after aek were denied the title because olympiakos were awarded three points for a game they lost after the opposing team fielded an ineligible player . `` the truth is that at the end of the championship , i felt great disappointment and a -lrb- sense of -rrb- injustice , but the love and support i have received from fans and the team have contributed to my final decision ... i have decided to stay at aek next season , '' rivaldo said in a statement on the club 's web site . olympiakos lost 1-0 on february 3 , but greek sports authorities gave them the points because apollon played roman wallner who had turned out for two other clubs during the season . apollon 's appeal to the court of arbitration for sport was rejected on april 21 . olympiakos finished the season with 70 points , two ahead of aek , for their 11th title in 12 years . rivaldo , who has played at ac milan and barcelona and starred in brazil 's 2002 world cup victory , spent three seasons at olympiakos from 2004 . he moved to aek last year after a contract dispute . tottenham midfielder jamie o'hara has signed a new three-year contract with the club . the 21-year-old made his debut this season and went on to score two goals in a total 25 appearances . `` he has come a long way in a short space of time so i congratulate him and this new contract is recognition of his efforts , '' said manager juande ramos . `` jamie is an example to all the young players at the club in that reaching the first team can be achieved through hard work and giving the best of yourself . '' however , tottenham goalkeeper radek cerny has left the club . the 34-year-old czech international , who was on loan from sparta prague , has joined ambitious championship club queens park rangers on a two-year contract .
983	douglas , arizona -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it 's a tale of homeland security concerns blocking wildlife management , and the hue and cry that ensues . this photo , taken by warner glenn in 1996 , is believed to be the first of a live jaguar in the united states . when most people think of jaguars , they think of the jungles of central and south america , not the remote desert ranges between the united states and mexico . that region is known as mountain lion country , and that 's what rancher warner glenn thought he was tracking when he saddled up his mules on a summer day 12 years ago near douglas , arizona . glenn has hunted mountain lions for 60 years , since he was eight years old . but glenn was stunned when he saw what his hunting dogs had chased up to a high mountain perch . the rancher took what 's believed to be the first photo of a live jaguar in the united states . but it was n't his last . in 2006 , some 40 miles away , glenn and his hunting party again cornered a jaguar -- a different one . jaguars , an endangered species , have a breeding population in northern mexico . scientists believe there are no more than 120 left in the wild there . it 's believed that since 1910 , the cats are only visitors north of the border . they have been virtually unstudied here until recently . but glenn and other conservationists worry that the possible return of breeding jaguars to the united states could be stopped in its tracks . the reason : the border fence . last month the department of homeland security waived 30 environmental laws to finish 470 miles of the fence by the end of the year . homeland security secretary michael chertoff told congress that the agency continues to talk to some 600 landowners along the border to get their input . but in order to comply with the congressional mandate , he said , there is no time to deal with `` unnecessary delays caused by administrative processes or potential litigation . '' `` we are currently in a lawless situation at the border , '' says chertoff . `` i feel an urgency to get this tactical infrastructure in . and although we 're going to be respectful of the environment , we 're going to be expeditious . '' two environmental groups , defenders of wildlife and the sierra club , have filed appeals with the u.s. supreme court , claiming the waivers are unconstitutional and set a dangerous precedent . `` national security and environmental protection do not have to be at odds with each other , '' says defenders of wildlife spokesman matt clark . `` if we can drop this arbitrary deadline for constructing the fence and go through the proper procedures , then there are inevitably ways to minimize environmental impact , but as it is now it 's throwing all of those laws out the window . '' mountain lion tracker jack childs also worries about the impact of the fence on local wildlife , especially the jaguar . childs captured the first video of a live jaguar in the late summer of 1996 , a few months after warner glenn . watch childs and glenn talk about efforts to preserve the jaguar '' `` i knew historically there had been a few jaguars sighted in arizona but in the last hundred years never in any numbers . '' his encounter sparked a passion for the big cats . along with wife anna and biologist emil mccain , he created the borderlands jaguar detection project . see images of the controversy '' childs and mccain hike into remote mountain areas where the jaguars roam and have placed more than 50 motion sensor cameras near the border . they 've taken 69 photos of three different jaguars since 2001 , including several of the same cat childs first saw in 1996 . he has nicknamed that cat macho b . a jaguar 's spots are like fingerprints -- each cat has a unique set . one of the spots on macho b resembles a pinocchio cartoon figure , and that 's how they identify him . `` we spend a lot of time walking along the border during the daytime , and we actually find his tracks going through the fence , so we know for sure that he crosses back and forth , '' says childs . `` a fence like that is going to inhibit wildlife movements and migrations back and forth . it 's not going to effectively stop human traffic . they 've got wire cutters and torches . '' see where the jaguars have been spotted '' childs says the fence also has an impact on wildlife because drug runners and human traffickers have been pushed up into the mountain areas to avoid the fence in the lowland valleys . `` it 's impacting the animals number one , what 's going on down there . it 's almost brought my wildlife study to a stop because they -lrb- the traffickers -rrb- are tearing down my cameras as fast as i 'm putting them up because they think we 're taking pictures of them . '' the u.s. fish and wildlife service finds itself in a unique position . its mission is wildlife and habitat protection , but it must uphold another federal agency 's mission to override environmental concerns . bill radke , manager of the san bernardino wildlife refuge , says the border patrol is trying to work with his agency . `` the hope is that by working with border patrol that we can meet the national security mandate and at the same time protect the wildlife , '' says radke . `` border patrol is putting up camera towers but are putting them up on areas that are off the refuge . they 're working on barriers but not barriers that would impede wildlife and large animals like jaguars . '' at 6 foot 6 , with steely blue eyes , dressed in leather chaps astride his mule , rancher warner glenn is every inch the american cowboy . and he is a man forever changed by his encounters with the jaguar . he has written a book , `` eyes of fire , '' about his experience . he says he 'd like to `` invite mr. bush to come out on a mule '' so he can see `` what 's going on here in these mountains . '' for glenn , the cat represents all that is wild about the southwest . `` it would be a loss to me that maybe my granddaughter or my daughter would n't be able to see one like i have . it 's just an animal that 's a beautiful , magnificent cat and they 're having a little bit of trouble surviving . but they 're doing it , and i would hate to see us do anything that would cause the survival of that cat to go backwards . `` i 'm a livestock rancher , but i would n't mind donating a few calves to that jaguar , so to speak . '' biologist emil mccain agrees . `` they are part of our natural heritage . they are part of the american west . they are part of the american wild as much as the bald eagle or the grizzly bear , and the jaguar is really special because it is such an elusive and beautiful creature -lsb- that -rsb- it evokes a sense of imagination and curiosity about the natural world .

987	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. government has charged an international arms dealer with conspiring to sell a rebel group millions of dollars in weapons `` to be used to kill americans in colombia , '' federal prosecutors announced tuesday . viktor bout is accused of selling missiles , rockets and other weapons to farc , a colombian rebel group . viktor bout , who was recently captured in thailand , had agreed to sell the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- surface-to-air missiles , armor-piercing rocket launchers , `` ultralight '' airplanes , unmanned aerial vehicles , and other weapons , the u.s. department of justice said in a news release . there was no immediate public response from bout , who remains in custody in thailand . federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging bout with four terrorism offenses : conspiracy to kill u.s. nationals , conspiracy to kill u.s. officers or employees , conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile , and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . farc is designated a terrorist organization by the u.s. state department . justice department officials said they are seeking bout 's extradition to the united states . the indictment alleges that bout made agreements with farc between november 2007 and march of this year . in their news release , federal prosecutors said bout agreed to sell weapons `` to two confidential sources '' working with the u.s. drug enforcement administration , who had `` represented that they were acquiring these weapons for the farc , with the specific understanding that the weapons were to be used to attack united states helicopters in colombia . '' the news release also refers to a `` covertly recorded meeting in thailand on march 6 , 2008 . '' `` with the unsealing of this indictment , we are one step closer to ensuring bout has delivered his last load of high-powered weaponry and armed his final terrorist , '' dea acting administrator michele m. loenhart said in the news release . attorney general michael mukasey last month singled out bout as a leading example of a new breed of organized crime leaders who operate across international boundaries to amass wealth without regard to political ideology . `` viktor bout has long been considered by the international community as one of the world 's most prolific arms traffickers , '' u.s. attorney michael garcia said in the news release tuesday . bout 's assets in the united states were frozen in 2004 after he allegedly shipped weapons to liberia in violation of u.s. government restrictions .
988	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in `` street kings , '' keanu reeves ' bad-boy cop tom ludlow may not play by the rules , but the film sure does . keanu reeves , second from left , and forest whitaker are shifty cops in `` street kings . '' the movie is textbook cop noir . directed by david ayer , who wrote `` training day '' and directed `` harsh times , '' from a script that originated with `` l.a. confidential '' novelist james ellroy , it 's a story both men have told before and will doubtless return to again . too bad that story -- the one about the constant struggle with an impure world , betrayal , disillusionment , retribution , all that jazz -- is n't told with much originality this time around . as ludlow , a detective with a special lapd vice squad , reeves shoots first and asks questions much , much later . in his field the bad guys are easy to spot , and if tom has to get his hands dirty , well , then he 'll be careful to wipe away the residue before he calls it in . he works from the gut . we have ludlow 's number from the beginning : he wakes up , vomits , cleans his gun , and knocks back a couple of miniature bottles of vodka . then he crashes a kidnappers ' den and puts down four gangsters before they know what 's hit them . `` do n't worry , '' he tells the distraught little girls caged up in the back . `` i 'm a cop . '' it 's probably superfluous to add that he 's still nursing a grievous hangover from the wife who died in flagrante with a person unknown two or three years ago . it 's also probably superfluous to mention that internal affairs -lrb- headed by hugh laurie -rrb- is beginning to sniff around ludlow 's unit . in particular , ia is talking to his ex-partner washington -lrb- terry crews -rrb- , a revelation that sends ludlow reaching for his baseball bat . before he can put washington straight , though , his old pal is gunned down before his eyes by a couple of punks . can ludlow cover up his own potentially incriminating presence at the scene and still track down the cop killers ? hell , yes , even if he has to alienate everyone in the department before he 's through . reeves does n't do much `` acting '' as such , but he does n't need to : his performance is clean and spare , in synch with ayer 's clipped economy , and he has a doleful quality that goes some way to redeem a nasty and wretchedly naïve character . alcoholism does n't appear to have thrown off ludlow 's aim any , but it must have dulled his reasoning . a broody , intuitive detective should be able to piece together this boilerplate mystery without too much head-scratching , but ludlow never stops to look even two steps ahead . -lrb- i guess he 's not a james ellroy fan . -rrb- . but what he lacks in insight he makes up for in sheer determination , not to say blood-lust . in a neat touch , when it 's time to cool off his public profile for a spell , the rogue cop is transferred to a desk in the complaints department -- surely his idea of purgatory , and , obviously , an utterly pointless occupation . forest whitaker boosts the energy level as ludlow 's paternalistic mentor , boss , and no. 1 fan : `` you 're the tip of the spear , '' he tells him . `` who else is going to hold back the animals ? '' violent and cynical and a shade or two overdetermined , `` street kings '' ably demonstrates the pitfalls embedded in the pragmatics of `` a necessary evil , '' or anyone who sets himself up as a law unto himself , but ultimately it ca n't conceive of a better alternative . after all , the rest is politics , a game that even the most hard-boiled anti-hero would never lower himself to enter . and , besides , he 's seen it before . `` street kings '' is rated r and runs 107 minutes . for entertainment weekly 's take , click here . e-mail to a friend .

'' one of the stated goals of the pope 's visit is to energize the u.s. catholic community , which has an estimated 70 million members . three years after succeeding pope john paul ii , benedict is likely to address the sex scandal within the catholic church , the church 's relationship with other faiths , the u.s.-led war in iraq and the upcoming u.s. presidential election , said john allen , a cnn vatican analyst . the fallout from the sex scandal has had a serious impact on the u.s. catholic church in terms of its finances , its moral authority and the demoralization of catholics . during the flight from rome to washington , the pope told reporters aboard that he was ashamed of the problem . watch the pope express his shame about the scandal '' ` intense ' security . meanwhile , security preparations were under way in the air , on land and in the water . twenty-seven state , local and federal agencies will protect the pope as he meets with religious leaders , celebrates mass at a baseball stadium and makes his way around the capital in his distinctive `` popemobile . '' there are no specific threats against benedict , according to the fbi , but a march audio message from osama bin laden mentioned the pontiff . the centerpiece of the washington leg of the u.s. visit will be thursday 's mass at nationals park , a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to watch the pope . everyone will go through metal detectors on their way in , and nearby roads and bridges will be closed . temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium . watch how washington is preparing for papal visit '' a 1 1/2 - mile section of the adjacent anacostia river will be closed during the mass. . the coast guard will patrol the river in boats with machine guns mounted on their bows . `` i am worried about a terrorist attack , '' said lt. lynda lecrone of the coast guard . `` we are here to detect , deter and defend against waterborne attack on this highly publicized event . ... we can use force .

'' he said boys usually have some focus and a concrete goal when they fight . `` but girls want to cause pain and make the other girl feel bad , '' he said . judd , the polk county sheriff , said an important part of the plan in the lakeland attack was to post the video of the beating on youtube to humiliate and embarrass the victim . `` it 's the next stage of cyberbullying , '' psychologist susan lipkins said . `` they want to show what they 're doing . '' `` our kids are being peer pressured , in another sense of a trend , to put these shock videos out there at other peoples ' expense , '' said talisa lindsay , the victim 's mother . `` and i hope that it does n't come to the point where there 's more people 's lives that are being affected by having to take a beating for entertainment , or possibly being killed . '' watch mother describe how the victim is doing '' the suspects did n't have a chance to post the video online before police moved in and seized it , judd said . the sheriff 's department made it public , and it wound up on youtube anyway . judd recognizes the irony . `` in a perverted sense , we were feeding into exactly what the kids wanted , '' he said . `` but according to florida law , -lsb- the video -rsb- is public record , and it 's going to be in the public domain whether we agree with that or not .

994	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- georgian leaders may be blaming russia for the conflict raging in south ossetia , but former soviet president mikhail gorbachev said thursday `` there is no doubt '' that georgia provoked the clash . mikhail gorbachev told cnn 's larry king that russia called extra troops into georgia to stem violence . gorbachev told cnn 's larry king that russia moved additional forces into south ossetia in response to `` devastation '' in the south ossetia city of tskhinvali . `` this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town , against a sleeping people . this was a barbaric assault , '' said gorbachev , the last president of the former soviet union . but georgian president mikheil saakashvili , who also appeared on cnn 's `` larry king live '' thursday , said he was `` profoundly shocked '' that mikhail gorbachev would use a television appearance `` for basically vindicating lies and deceptions . '' last week , georgia said it launched an operation into south ossetia after a cease-fire was broken with artillery fire from russian separatists that killed 10 people including civilians and peacekeepers . it accused russia , which also has peacekeepers in the region , of backing the separatists . hours later , the russian news agency interfax reported that russian authorities said 10 russian peacekeepers had been killed and 30 wounded in an attack by georgians . `` western television did n't show what happened in tskhinvali , '' gorbachev said . `` only now they 're beginning to show some pictures of the destruction . so this looks to me like it was a well-prepared project . and with any outcome , they wanted to put the blame on russia . '' watch gorbachev discuss `` barbaric assault '' '' he called georgia 's claims that russia is attempting to dismantle its democracy `` all lies from beginning to end . '' in response , saakashvili expressed disappointment with the sentiments from gorbachev , who he said he once respected . `` this is the man , mr. gorbachev , who helped to , you know , bring down kgb kingdom . and he is the one who is , you know , justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country , '' saakashvili said . `` shame on him . shame on you , mr. gorbachev , for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union . '' gorbachev also said the united states is jeopardizing its fragile relationship with russia by backing georgia . watch gorbachev discuss u.s.-russia relations '' `` there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u.s. and russia interests , and the interests of other countries , and the interests of stability , particularly in the hotspots in different continents , '' said gorbachev , who won the nobel peace price in 1990 .
995	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states believes that some members of pakistan 's spy service provided support for the deadly bombing last month of india 's embassy in afghanistan , a u.s. counterterrorism official told cnn friday . the indian embassy in kabul was badly damaged in the july 7 bombing . pakistan strongly denied the allegation friday , but afghanistan and india have previously accused pakistan of involvement in the attack which killed 58 people including an indian defense attache . the official told cnn the evidence was not strong enough to draw a firm conclusion but there is a `` strong suspicion '' the taliban was behind the attack , and that some unspecified aid came from pakistan 's directorate of inter-services intelligence , or isi . the official would not say how the intelligence was gathered , but he said the evidence was presented to senior pakistani officials by a top cia official , deputy director stephen kappes . the new york times , sourcing u.s. government officials , reported friday that the united states intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack in kabul . pakistani maj. gen. athar abbas said the report `` unfounded and malicious '' and an `` effort to malign the isi , '' -- pakistan 's directorate of inter-services intelligence . the bombing killed 58 people . `` the isi is a very disciplined organization , manned by military officials . it has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al qaeda , the taliban , and those linked to the attack on mainland america on 9/11 , '' abbas said . abbas said `` despite our insistence , no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations . '' afghanistan claims pakistan informally supports militants operating from havens in pakistan 's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share . earlier this month , afghan lawmakers directly accused pakistan 's isi in connection with a string of attacks in afghanistan . among these were the kabul strike and an assassination attempt on afghan president hamid karzai at an april 27 military ceremony . a senior afghan government official said the charges were based on phone intercepts of conversations of plotters in kabul with isi officers in pakistan . a u.s. government official , who would not comment on the specifics of the new york times story , said , `` we 've long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the isi and the taliban , and the incident at the indian embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports . '' india has previously blamed militants from pakistan for the july 7 car bombing at the embassy . wajid shamsul hasan , pakistan 's high commissioner to britain , and hamid gul , former head of the isi , firmly denied the agency 's involvement in the attack . watch pakistan deny the allegations '' `` there seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story , '' hasan said . he said the government has regularly denied claims that isi is involved with militants in afghanistan and noted that pakistan has been cooperating in the fight against terrorism . gul said the claims are `` preposterous '' and `` totally false , '' and cautioned that the cia has been proven to be wrong about intelligence in the past . the new york times report also sourced the u.s. officials as saying `` there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them , in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistan 's tribal areas . '' pakistan and afghanistan have a tumultuous past . during the soviet occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , religious schools in pakistan helped train fighters who battled the soviets . after the taliban took over afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule , pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically . it dropped its support after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on washington and new york . pakistan also has a troubled history with india , and in the past india has accused the isi of supporting militant separatists in indian-administered kashmir , which has been the root of two wars between them .
